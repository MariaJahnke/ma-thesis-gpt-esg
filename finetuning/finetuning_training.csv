Prevention Measures:
Compliance Management Software (CMS):
 - The CMS, which is founded on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, promotes growth while mitigating financial risks from non-compliant behavior. It extends across all corporate functions and the value chain.
 - The system incorporates worldwide norms for employee behaviour, which are enforced by the Fair Play Code of Conduct, which is available online and updated on a regular basis. Management shares compliance-related communications on a frequent basis. The Fair Play Code of Conduct is available online and by poster in the offices.
 - Contracts with business partners include provisions that allow for the suspension or termination of agreements. This decreases the danger of third-party misbehavior.
Identification Measures - The central Compliance team, in collaboration with Regional and Local Compliance Managers, undertakes systematic assessments of important compliance risks every year. Compliance reviews are also undertaken on a regular basis within designated companies.
 - Increased collaboration among the Compliance team, Internal Audit, Group Policies and Internal Controls, and Risk Management departments ensures complete monitoring and control.

Adidas' strategy to preventing, detecting, and addressing corruption and bribery situations is thorough and well-structured, encompassing frequent training, clear policy communication, and detection tools. These steps result in the completion of the first phase of the G1-3 regulation."

The framework and reporting systems are intended to ensure objectivity and integrity throughout the investigation. This is due to the following reasons:

 -Chief Compliance Officer (CCO): The CCO is in charge of all compliance-related investigations, with help from Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance Officers. This framework ensures that inquiries are carried out independently of the implicated chain of command. A compliance violation is defined in the code of conduct.
 - Independence from Business Units: The investigative Team is independent of the business units concerned in the reported compliance concerns. Procedure for reporting findings:
 - Regular Reporting to Higher Authorities: The CCO provides regular updates to the Executive Board on the status of the compliance program and key compliance cases. It is unclear what regular means. - Audit Committee Involvement: The CCO is also responsible for reporting to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. The CCO attended audit meeting meetings to talk about key compliance cases and monitor them.
All potentials of noncompliance are monitored, and reported globally, but not all of them are categorised as key cases. The rating of the cases is done internally by the local compliance team, separate from the management chain.

Adidas' compliance report fulfils the second part of the G1-3 requirements."

Assessing the Independence of the Investigation Committee:

Siemens Healthineers has a complete CMS to assure independence in corruption and bribery investigations. The CMS emphasizes prevention, detection, and reaction. Internal standards require Siemens Healthineers workers to follow compliance processes and tools for numerous risk areas, including anti-corruption measures

- The AFC, an autonomous business function, sets and implements financial crime risk management policies and standards. The Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer, reporting to the Chief Administration Officer, has final say on financial crime concerns, establishing a clear separation from normal company operations 
   
 - Siemens Healthineers' ICS and ERM frameworks are based on worldwide standards like COSO. Internal audit functions combine and audit these systems to verify their efficacy. The organized system ensures inquiry independence, with internal audit functions reporting directly to top management and the audit committee
 - The audit committee is crucial to accounting procedures, ICS, ERM, and internal audit system effectiveness. The committee swiftly and accurately reports results from investigations, including compliance violations, to higher authorities within the organization 
 - Siemens Healthineers evaluates its ICS and ERM systems regularly and annually. The management board reviews and approves the ""In Control"" statement, which details these evaluations. Comprehensive reporting to the supervisory board audit committee ensures timely escalation of serious findings and compliance concerns 
 - Identify and evaluate compliance issues early, incorporating them into corporate operations. Reporting risk assessment results to top management and incorporating them into the company-wide ERM keeps higher authorities aware about potential risks and mitigation strategies

- Comprehensive risk identification and assessment, appropriate and thorough policies and procedures, frequent training, and continuous consultation are important preventive strategies. In order to prevent compliance issues and make sure they follow the rules, they also implement internal controls. Fresenius has well-established internal controls in the compliance management procedures in this regard as well. The Fresenius Group's management board, which is headed by the labour relations director, risk management, and legal departments of Fresenius Management SE (FMSE), has been tasked with overseeing compliance. 
- The Member of the Management Board in charge of Human Resources (Labour Relations Director), Risk Management, and Legal is directly subordinate to the Fresenius Group's Group Chief Compliance Officer. 
- The business segments have set up separate channels of communication with their respective managers. When allowed by law, they can also report possible compliance incidents anonymously, for example, over the phone or online using whistleblower services and email accounts created especially for this purpose. The Compliance Officers of each business sector provide frequent compliance reports to the management teams. The investment committee is therefore not independent.  
- Cases of compliance are assessed in accordance with the group-wide policies. When a compliance situation of high severity arises, the Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA promptly notifies the board member in charge of Human Resources (Labour Relations Director), Risk Management, and Legal of FMSE. Both determine whether the relevant case needs to be brought before the FMSE Management Board. The Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA also provides an annual summary of reported incidents by category and business segment to the Management Board of FMSE. 
- The public can access the code of conduct.

- The Group-wide Content Management System (CMS) serves as the foundation for the Mercedes-Benz Group's Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme.  In the field of sales activities in high-risk nations, the Group observes heightened corruption concerns. The measures must be implemented and overseen by the management of each Group entity. The management team works closely with the Integrity and Legal Affairs division's specialised sections on this assignment. The management teams at each of the Group entities are under observation by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. 
- An impartial Local Compliance Officer supports businesses that are more likely to experience corruption, helping the corresponding management carry out the Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme.Mercedes-Benz Group AG hired KPMG AG to audit its Compliance Management System for corruption prevention in order to guarantee an impartial, external evaluation of the Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme. The Business Practices Office (BPO) whistleblower mechanism allows business partners, third parties, and all workers globally to report rule infractions. 
- Information can be given to the BPO via regular mail, email, or by completing a specific web form. The BPO is open for business around-the-clock. There are other external toll-free hotlines in the US, Brazil, Japan, and South Africa. If local regulations allow it, reports can also be submitted anonymously. In addition to the BPO, whistleblower complaints in Germany may also be sent to an outside, impartial middleman.  Within 24 hours of receiving a new report, the BPO typically notifies the whistleblower that it has been received. Following a preliminary risk assessment grounded in the four eyes principle, the BPO refers the case to the relevant department or an appropriate investigative unit.
- The Mercedes-Benz Group uses a range of communication strategies to make the BPO whistleblower system even more widely known to employees and to continuously build employee trust in it. In this case, the organisation additionally considers the insights gleaned from the most current employee survey.
- The Group offers educational resources like information cards tailored to each countries, pocket manuals, and a ten-language training DVD. The Mercedes-Benz Group provides each of its suppliers and sales partners with access to a Compliance Awareness Module, which is based on these principles and the Integrity Code. 
- To successfully complete each module, one must correctly answer test and control questions in the web-based training courses as a review of the knowledge you have received. 
- Administrative staff members have access to a web-based training programme designed for particular target audiences. This programme comprises not only a basic module that is required, but also manager-specific modules and expert modules covering a range of compliance problems. Mercedes-Benz Group AG automatically designates the appropriate modules to staff members upon hiring, promotion, or transitioning to a role with a higher level of risk. Every three years, employees are required to finish the training programme. It is not stated exactly what the scope and coverage rate of the training programme are.It seems that Mercedes Benz almost fulfillers the G1-3 regulations except the secure independence investigation committee."

Merck initiated this programme to enhance objectivity and provide a more data-driven risk strategy by introducing a worldwide compliance risk framework for all business sectors. 
- Furthermore, they developed a thorough risk matrix with an emphasis on bribery and corruption threats, which is demonstrated by elaborate risk classification and risk scenarios. \n- Merck often offers online training programmes and compliance classrooms covering topics such as healthcare compliance requirements, data protection, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, antitrust, and the Code of Conduct. 
- Depending on their level of risk exposure, Merck needs its workers to complete these courses. Certain courses are also applicable to workers who are under supervision, like temporary employees, and independent contractors.
- Two anti-corruption and anti-money laundering standards were distributed to senior management through internal communication channels in 2022 as part of our focused awareness programmes.  Additionally, they update and modify training curriculum frequently to reflect new information. 
- All workers at Merck are forced to report any possible infractions of compliance to their managers, legal counsel, human resources, or other pertinent departments. Globally, they can also report infractions in their local language via phone or through an online application by using our central whistleblowing compliance hotline, which is anonymous and free of charge. The Compliance Investigations and Case Management team reviews reports of possible compliance violations that they receive through the compliance hotline. Employees who have violated compliance policies may face appropriate disciplinary action based on the findings of the inquiry and recommendations made by the Compliance Case Committee or the Compliance inquiry Team. Merck takes preventive and corrective action if a root cause that may increase the likelihood of future compliance violations is found during the inquiry. This arrangement secures an independent examination.
External stakeholders can also reach the compliance hotline. The Compliance and Ethics section of our website contains the pertinent information. 
-Employees take required online courses and in-person training on our policies and procedures, as well as significant modifications to the reporting requirements for transfers of value, in order to stay informed about their duties and responsibilities and to stay up to date. Both frequency and coverage rate are left out. 
Therefore all requirements are met to fulfil the G1-3 regulations."

 - Employees and outside stakeholders can report suspected cases of illegal activity to the Compliance Officer using our global whistleblower system. Additionally, anonymous tips can be filed through the multilingual, web-based iTrust reporting system. 
- The compliance officer plans the appropriate investigative processes and evaluates all reports that are provided. The official in charge of compliance is independent. 
 - Employees are informed of the procedures for reporting non-compliance through internal media channels, and external stakeholders are provided with written explanations or online access.Whistleblowers receive private treatment. An outside source of due diligence services is also evaluating prospective sales consultants. - The sales consultants must state in the contracts that the ASD anti-corruption rules are legally binding. Regular audits are carried out by the corporate audit department, which verifies that internal policies and legal requirements are being followed by business processes and procedures.In 2022 alone, 3,131 workers received training on the Code of Conduct. Additionally, supervisors and staff members with specialised roles—like salespeople—are required to regularly attend anti-corruption training. 
- During the reporting year, all personnel impacted by export control requirements were required to complete mandatory training using a new concept that was introduced in 2020. This idea, known as the Internal Compliance Programme, was modified to comply with the regulatory requirements that were in effect throughout the reporting year. There is no mention of the frequency, scape, or coverage rate.
 - Concluding, that the G1-3 regulations are partly fulfilled."

- Munich Re views these values as the cornerstone of its business, and the Code of Conduct establishes a shared understanding of these principles throughout the Group. As a result, the document is accessible in English, German, French, and Spanish, Munich Re's primary working languages. 
- This procedure is predicated on a coordinated methodology for risk identification, assessment, and documentation used across the Group. At least once a year, the Group's material compliance risks and the associated risk-reduction strategies are examined and reported to the Board of Management. Internal and external whistleblowers can use the internet portal through the intranet (available exclusively to internal whistleblowers) and the Munich Re website. With an alias or username and password of their own choosing, individuals can set up a secure mailbox via the web portal. The whistleblower can communicate with Group Compliance and Legal or the relevant local compliance bodies in this way, exchanging files and messages in a secure and private manner. 
 - Therefore,  a separate investigation from the management chain is secured. 
- The data and mailbox are only kept on the whistleblower system, and individual encryption keeps them safe from access by outside parties.  This means that the CMS is evaluated on a regular basis and modified as needed depending on the outcomes of risk assessments, monitoring, and other pertinent data from the different departments. All new hires receive immediate notification of the Code of Conduct and must complete mandatory online training or pass an exam to prove they understand it. Workers often rectify their understanding of the Code of Conduct every two to three years. Integrating compliance into our business processes is a unique responsibility of the Board of Management and senior executives.  - Compliance reports are sent to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee and the Board of Management regularly (semi-annually, annually, or as needed). 
 - Every infraction we are aware of is carefully looked into and punished within the bounds of the law. Both are done with a focus on the target group and customised to meet the needs of the various local and international Group businesses and their unique business strategies. Regular attendance at training sessions covering the Code of Conduct or specific compliance subjects is mandated for both employees and management. Compulsory assessments, especially those conducted online, contribute to the long-term retention of the material. The coverage rate, as well as the scope and frequency of the training, are not mentioned. In conclusion, Münchner Rück partly complies with G1-3 regulations."

 - The Code of Conduct of Porsche AG lays forth the most important guidelines and standards for adherence in three areas: the workplace, as a business partner, and as a member of society. Porsche AG wants its business partners to follow guideline of Conduct for Business Partners. 
 - These guidelines specifically draws attention to Porsche AG's whistleblower programme. Moreover, Porsche AG has committed to ensure compliance with laws and norms by adopting the Compliance Management guidelines, which the Executive Board approved. It includes risk-oriented activities including arbitrary inspections of transactions that are significant in terms of compliance, in addition to management interviews. 
- During the reporting year, the  communication was concentrated on intranet posts covering International Anti-Corruption Day and the updated Code of Conduct pamphlet. Additionally, the compliance officers used a variety of internal communications to managers, departmental groups, and info sessions.Workers have established and disseminated an internal whistleblower process through which they can report possible violations of the rules. 
- Employees and outside parties can report violations to two people who are obligated by German law to maintain professional secrecy. One can get in touch with these free, anonymous, internal and external whistleblower system points of contact in a number always. When acting on incoming reports, Porsche AG considers labour legislation, co-determination regulations, and data protection. Porsche AG puts whistleblowers to any disciplinary actions or other consequences. 
- Porsche AG responds to infractions that are found in accordance with co-determination, labour legislation, and data protection requirements. Whatever the investigation's conclusion, appropriate countermeasures are implemented case-by-case, and individual wrongdoing is dealt with according to the investigation's findings. The fact that each case is being looked into separately is not stated. The compliance officers at Porsche AG and a few chosen subsidiaries conduct compliance training in collaboration with the HR division. The foundation is a subject-specific plan that determines the important content areas and pertinent target audiences through risk analyses. 
- New hires, managers, and junior managers must complete required training programmes. Additionally, the compliance officers arrange for organised training for particular departments and target audiences on subjects that are required by law, current events, or upon request.
 - 7,337 participants received compliance training through digital training modules, while 5,817 workers of Porsche AG and its pertinent German subsidiaries received compliance training through in-person and virtual events throughout the reporting year. 7,458 employees of Porsche AG's relevant German companies and 17,296 employees of Porsche AG completed the digital Code of Conduct training module. 
- In addition to covering the directive of the same name, this training module offers specifics on the whistleblower system and the compliance assistance desk's contact information. The topics of the ""Human rights"" and ""Avoidance of conflicts of interest and corruption"" rules are also covered in the course. By the end of the reporting year, Porsche AG and its relevant German subsidiaries had an average of 93% of the target group's training in face-to-face and virtual events for the defined areas of compliance. 
The only thing not stated is how frequently the trainings occur. The frequency and scope of trainings are not mentioned as well as the independent investigation process. Therefore, the G1-3 regulations are partly met."

- Qiagen's approach to preventing, identifying, and addressing corruption and bribery is detailed in their Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics, which is accessible to all employees via the intranet. \n - The company also employs a Global Compliance Manager who oversees a third-party due diligence program focusing on local distributors and agents. This program includes pre-screening and anti-corruption questionnaires, annual risk assessments, and mandatory compliance certifications. T 
 - these measures are designed to ensure that all partners align with Qiagen's anti-corruption policies.

- The Qiagen report does not provide specific details on the independence of the investigating committee from the management chain involved in any incidents. This lack of detail suggests a potential area where Qiagen might not fully meet the G1-3 regulatory requirements regarding the independence of the investigation.
- Qiagen has implemented comprehensive training programs covering topics such as antitrust, bribery, corruption, and general ethical behaviour. 
- Training is mandatory for new hires and staff in sensitive positions, like sales, marketing, and upper management. Qiagen also conducts regular refresher courses. However, the report does not specify the exact coverage rate of functions-at-risk, which is required under G1-3 regulations. This omission indicates a gap in fully disclosing the extent and impact of their training programs.
- While Qiagen demonstrates a structured approach to corruption and bribery prevention, including training and third-party oversight, there are gaps in the transparency regarding the independence of investigations and the specific coverage of at-risk functions."

Rheinmetall has taken steps to prevent, identify, and resolve corruption and bribery, including communicating its anti-corruption policy to stakeholders, including suppliers. A detailed Supplier Code of Conduct ensures responsible and fair conduct. We expect suppliers to follow these guidelines.
- The Global Compliance Manager oversees local distributor and agent due diligence, especially in corrupt regions.
- All compliance policies are available to employees via the intranet for transparency and ease. These policies offer feedback and inquiry addresses to boost engagement and compliance.
- The investigating committee's independence from management is not specified. Thus, the committee's independence from those it investigates is uncertain.
Rheinmetall reports findings to higher authorities, but the letter provides few specifics.
- Insider trading, bribery, corruption, and the Code of Conduct are required training for new personnel. The course determines refresher training frequency, from quarterly to three years. The training targets upper management and sales and marketing professionals due to their higher risks. The exact % coverage of these functions is not given.Specific training programs target managers and supervisors.

This report examines RWE's prevention, detection, and resolution of corruption and bribery, its investigation procedures' impartiality, and its training programs' efficacy.
RWE has a robust Compliance Management System (CMS) to ensure legal and internal compliance. The CMS is constantly assessed and contains several essential measures: Regular compliance risk evaluations by RWE identify and assess significant compliance risk fields.
- The compliance management system institutionalizes compliance and prevents wrongdoing, including corruption and bribery.
- RWE analyzes its Internal Control System (ICS) annually to ensure risk presentation and controls. Regular tests assess these controls' efficacy.

- All supplier contracts must include the company's Code of Conduct, which prohibits corruption and bribery. This ensures sellers follow ethics.
- RWE's web-based whistleblower system lets employees and others report problems anonymously. This technology detects and reports compliance violations early.
RWE's compliance infraction investigations are independent of the implicated chain of command:
- All compliance officers report to the Chief Compliance Officer, who informs the Executive Board and Supervisory Board Audit Committee of compliance issues and probable violations.

Reporting infractions is confidential and protected under the whistleblower system. This preserves investigation independence.
- The Internal Audit & Security Department reports ICS evaluations to RWE AG's Executive Board.
- The Supervisory Board Audit Committee analyzes ICS effectiveness and receives annual Executive Board reports.

-An annual web-based compliance training is required, with additional in-person training based on employees' responsibilities' risks.
-The training curriculum comprises the Executive Board and covers compliance management system components and anti-corruption behaviours.

-The complete training program emphasizes high-risk functions. The company prioritizes training for all employees, particularly those at higher risk of corruption. Annual feedback from executives on compliance training has been collected, with a 100% response rate in 2022, indicating widespread engagement.

RWE AG's ESG report shows a strong framework for avoiding, recognizing, and combating corruption and bribery. The company's compliance management system, independent investigations, and thorough training meet G1-3 regulations. The report emphasises RWE's ethical and compliant operations. While the present measures are strong, transparency and regular updates on their efficacy are essential for regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust. 

The ESG report meets G1-3 regulatory criteria with detailed policy implementation and aggressive anti-corruption and anti-bribery actions. Based on the facts, there are no major gaps in detail or implementation.
