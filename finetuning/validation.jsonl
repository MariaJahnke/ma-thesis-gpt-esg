The following committees\nwere in place in the year under review:\n\u2013 Personnel and Governance Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, Finance and\nInvestment Committee, Technology and Strategy Committee, People and Culture\nCommittee, Nomination Committee, Go-To-Market and Operations Committee\nEach of the aforementioned committees was active in 2022. For more information about the\nSupervisory Board committees, particularly their respective composition, tasks, and responsibilities,\nsee the Corporate Governance Statement and the Corporate Governance section of SAP\u2019s Web site.\nBesides the matters described above, the committees focused primarily on the following topics in\n2022:\n\u2013 The Personnel and Governance Committee held four regular meetings in the reporting year. In\nparticular, the Committee, in fulfillment of the tasks assigned to it, extensively prepared and\ndiscussed in advance the deliberations of the Supervisory Board and its resolutions on the new\nExecutive Board compensation system. It also approved two loans for officers of SAP who hold\nprocura powers. At its meeting in February, it did preparatory work on the Supervisory Board\u2019s\nproposal to the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders with respect to the adjustment of\nSupervisory Board compensation. It also deliberated on the draft Supervisory Board report for the\nfinancial year 2021, SAP\u2019s competitive position, and the Executive Board\u2019s customer relationship\nmanagement (CRM) strategy. When the Committee met in April 2022, it reviewed the composition\nof the Supervisory Board committees that was envisaged after the Annual General Meeting of\nShareholders on May 18, 2022. On July 27, 2022, the Committee conducted its regular review of\npension payments made to former Executive Board members and deliberated on the creation of a\nformalized process for the feedback of the Supervisory Board vis-\u00e0-vis Executive Board members.\nIn addition, it updated the target number of women on the Executive Board and the diversity\nconcept. It was resolved that SAP should voluntarily keep to its target of having two women on the\nExecutive Board. The Committee additionally dealt, at both its April and July meetings, with the\nsearch for a successor to SAP\u2019s CFO Luka Mucic, who would be leaving the Company in\nMarch 2023. Even between meetings, the Committee members were in continual contact with the\n23/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\npersonnel consulting firm that had been enlisted for this purpose, and conducted interviews of\npotential candidates. The Committee chairperson reported on the status of the candidate search in\nthe meetings of the full Supervisory Board. Finally, in August, the Committee initiated the proposed\nresolution by the full Supervisory Board on the appointment of the new CFO. The focus of the\nOctober 2022 meeting was once again the aforementioned feedback process and its\nimplementation. In addition, the Committee deliberated on the process for cultivating and\nshortlisting internal talents who were considered potential successors to Executive Board positions.\n\u2013 The Audit and Compliance Committee held 11 regular meetings in 2022 \u2013 two of which jointly with\nthe Finance and Investment Committee and one jointly with the Technology and Strategy\nCommittee. Said schedule included one short telephone conference per quarter to vote on the\nquarterly reporting, and one session per quarter to address regular and topical agenda items. In its\nmeetings, the Committee also had the opportunity to engage with the auditor without the Executive\nBoard present, which was an integral part of the meeting agenda. The Committee comprehensively\nprepared the resolutions of the Supervisory Board for all topics assigned to it, as described above.\nRegular agenda items included the course of business in the respective quarter, the accounting\nprocesses, the preparation of end-of-quarter closings, and the quarterly reports due for publication.\nIn addition, the (new) Committee chairperson was in regular contact with the auditor. Other\nrecurring meeting topics included the monitoring of SAP\u2019s risk management system, internal control\nsystem, and compliance system (including specific compliance issues, the status of corresponding\nSAP-internal investigations, and case-related collaboration with authorities), and cybersecurity. In\nits February 2022 meeting, the Committee prepared the Supervisory Board\u2019s resolutions on the\nfinancial statements of SAP SE and the Group for 2021 in the run-up to the Annual General\nMeeting of Shareholders, which were adopted at the audit meeting. Other material topics dealt\nwith by the Committee beyond the regular meeting topics in its ordinary meetings and those\ndescribed in the \u201cSustainability\u201d section of this report included quarter-specific matters and the\ncompensation system for SAP\u2019s Sales organization. Further, the Committee monitored the progress\nof selected lawsuits involving SAP. The Audit and Compliance Committee also received regular\nupdates on activities relating to the change in auditor for SAP\u2019s financial statements and\nconsolidated financial statements, particularly progress reports on the onboarding of the new\nauditor. In addition, the Committee continually monitored the quality of the current and future\nauditor and the management report. To this end \u2013 in addition to evaluating satisfaction surveys for\nthe previous year\u2019s audit by the current auditor \u2013 the Committee obtained and referred to regular\nreports from the auditor on its internal quality assurance standards and to any material findings\nfrom internal quality audits, external quality controls, and peer reviews, and from any investigations\nconducted by the government or regulators into the auditor's audits. The Committee discussed the\naudit focus for 2022 with the auditor at its meeting in July. As reported in more detail below, the\nCommittee also held two joint meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee in February\nand December 2022 to discuss the Group annual plan for 2022 and the preliminary Group annual\nplan for 2023. The joint meeting with the Technology and Strategy Committee in July focused on\nthe results of the assessment by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, a\ndepartment of the U.S. Department of Commerce) and the progress of certain internal audits. The\nauditor attended all Audit and Compliance Committee meetings except for the joint meetings with\nthe Finance and Investment Committee and the Technology and Strategy Committee, and reported\nin depth on its audit work and on its quarterly reviews of selected software and cloud agreements.\n\u2013 The Finance and Investment Committee held six regular meetings and five extraordinary meetings\nin 2022, and outside these meetings it passed two resolutions by correspondence. It held a joint\nmeeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in February and again in December 2022, and\na joint meeting with the Technology and Strategy Committee in December 2022 as described in\nmore detail below. In an extraordinary meeting in January 2022, the Committee approved the\nacquisition of a minority interest in Icertis, a contract lifecycle management specialist based in the\nUnited States. It also discussed the planned acquisition of Taulia, an American working capital\nmanagement firm, at length and ultimately resolved to recommend the acquisition to the\nSupervisory Board. In the joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in\n24/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nFebruary 2022, the members of both Committees discussed the annual budget for 2022 and voted\nin favor of recommending its approval to the Supervisory Board. At the Finance and Investment\nCommittee meeting on the same day, the new head of the Investor Relations team introduced\nhimself, provided an overview of the core topics in his remit, and presented his strategic concept.\nWhen it met in April, the Committee and the Executive Board discussed selected investor relations\nand capital market topics, strategic business plans for various product areas, plans for future\ncollaboration with SAP partners, and potential divestments. The Executive Board also reported on\nthe major investments planned and on its analysis of employee efficiency. During the Committee\u2019s\nfirst meeting in July, it deliberated on the sale of the Litmos business as described above. At its\nsecond meeting in July, the Committee dealt with Investor Relations matters and engaged in a\ndetailed discussion about the efficiency of SAP\u2019s development organization. The Executive Board\nalso presented its new strategy for investing in the venture capital sector in collaboration with the\nSapphire Ventures team. After extensive consultation, the Committee resolved to recommend that\nthe Supervisory Board approve the set-up of a new fund for direct investments totaling\nUS$1.25 billion and a further venture capital fund for fund-of-funds investments totaling\nUS$100 million. The Committee also resolved, by way of correspondence, to recommend the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s consent to a share buy-back program worth \u20ac500 million and approved the\nextension of existing bilateral bank loans. In the October meeting, the Executive Board updated the\nCommittee on investor relations and treasury topics, explained its plans to streamline the portfolio,\nand presented its regular report on the success of the Company's recent acquisitions. Beyond this,\nthe Committee and the Executive Board discussed management efficiency and competency, and\nexamined process optimizations in the cloud. In addition, the Committee reviewed its own activities\nand the format of its meetings, with a view to good corporate governance. At its two extraordinary\nmeetings held on December 12 and 13, 2022, the Committee was apprised of planned\nimprovements to selected business areas and drafted a resolution to recommit funds previously\ndedicated in July 2022 for Sapphire Ventures fund-of funds activities. In December 2022, the\nCommittee held a second joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee, at which the\nExecutive Board presented the preliminary Group annual plan for 2023. This meeting was held in\npreparation for the Supervisory Board meeting in February 2023, at which the full Supervisory\nBoard resolved to approve the Group annual plan for 2023.\n\u2013 The Technology and Strategy Committee held six meetings in 2022, which included one joint\nmeeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee and one joint meeting with the Finance and\nInvestment Committee. The Committee discussed the outlook for key technology trends in the\nsoftware industry in the years to come and SAP\u2019s corporate and product strategies. The Executive\nBoard explained SAP\u2019s midmarket and customer experience strategies to the Committee members\nat its February meeting, where the two bodies also discussed the specific requirements resulting\nfrom the rapid growth and expansion of medium-sized customers. In April, the Committee turned\nits attention to artificial intelligence and \u201cdata to value\u201d \u2013 the act of deriving business value from\ndata \u2013 placing particular focus on the integration of data sources in compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements. In July 2022, the Executive Board updated the Committee on the strategic\nplans for process intelligence and automation and explained how SAP Signavio solutions would be\nused to expand SAP\u2019s opportunities in the business process optimization space. At the joint\nmeeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee, also in July, the Committee was updated on\nprogress in the areas of enterprise vulnerability management and asset management. When it met\nin October 2022, the Committee examined SAP\u2019s innovation strategy as regards business\ntransformation, business network, and sustainability. At their joint meeting in December, the\nTechnology and Strategy Committee and the Finance and Investment Committee deliberated on\nthe efficiency of SAP\u2019s development organization and were given an overview of SAP\u2019s current\ndevelopment processes and tools by the Executive Board.\n\u2013 The People and Culture Committee met five times in the reporting year. The focus of its February\nmeeting was on strategic personnel planning as relate to the \u201cthe future of work\u201d concept and the\nevolution of skills. The Committee was presented in this regard with a detailed overview of the past\nand expected demographic development of the SAP SE workforce, and discussed the skills and\n25/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nexpertise the Company would require of employees in the future. In addition, the global head of\nDiversity and Inclusion introduced herself to the Committee, following which the Committee looked\nat the career development of employees in expert functions and discussed the refining of SAP\u2019s\nleadership culture introduced the year before. Performance management was a key topic of the\nJuly meeting, where an initiative to promote appreciation and respect at the Company was\npresented. The Committee then reviewed the progress made in this initiative and the feedback\nreceived from employees in this connection at its October meeting, where it also looked at\ninvestments in headcount and the compensation budgets for 2023. The Committee held an\nextraordinary meeting in November where it and the Executive Board looked in-depth at the talent\ndevelopment process the Company was pursuing in the SAP S/4HANA area. The two bodies\naddressed three specific aspects in this regard: improving the quality of the recruitment process,\ntraining and upskilling staff, and promoting the performance culture at SAP.\n\u2013 The Nomination Committee met four times in 2022. In February 2022, it deliberated on proposed\nsuccessors for the departing Supervisory Board member Bernard Liautaud. Following\ncorresponding interviews and careful evaluation of the competencies of all persons under\nconsideration, it resolved the nomination of Jennifer Li as further candidate for election to the\nSupervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2022. The Committee came to the\nconclusion that Jennifer Li had the best qualifications to succeed Bernard Liautaud and that her\nother mandates outside SAP would not prevent her from performing her duties as a member of the\nSupervisory Board and making valuable contributions to the work of the SAP Supervisory Board.\nThe Committee also met on July 27, 2022, where it discussed succession planning on the\nSupervisory Board, particularly for the position of chairperson, and agreed that the search for\nsuitable candidates should continue to be conducted both within SAP and outside the Company.\nAs in the past, the Committee enlisted the help of a renowned personnel consulting firm for this\npurpose. In its meeting on October 27, 2022, the Committee members discussed the status of the\ncandidate search and the initial results submitted to it by the consulting firm. At the Committee\u2019s\nmeeting in December, the personnel consultant presented a short list of candidates, which the\nCommittee discussed in depth before deliberating on the next steps in the search.\n\u2013 The Go-To-Market and Operations Committee likewise met four times in the reporting year. At the\nFebruary meeting, the Committee was informed of the cloud revenues generated in 2022 versus\nthe year before, apprised of the current cloud backlog growth, and presented with the Executive\nBoard\u2019s current strategy to accelerate growth in the cloud. In April, the Executive Board presented a\nnew strategy for technology and sales that addressed how SAP would position its technologies in\nthe market going forward and the role SAP Business Technology Platform would play in this. In\nJuly, the Committee was updated on SAP\u2019s competitive situation and, based on this information,\ndiscussed with the Executive Board what strategic decisions would result from this. The two bodies\nthen deliberated on how SAP cloud solutions could be run more efficiently in key strategic\nbusiness areas. The October meeting focused on the transformation of the Cloud Success Services\n(CSS) area, which had been triggered at the beginning of 2021. The core of this transformation was\nthe merger of various user departments into one CSS unit that supported SAP\u2019s cloud portfolio.\nThe Executive Board first explained how this measure was intended to ensure end-to-end\ncustomer relationships that focused on customer success and customer lifetime value. It then\npresented the Committee with the CSS targets and the Company\u2019s plans for expanding the\norganization further. The Committee also examined how SAP\u2019s partner ecosystem evolved with the\nshift to the cloud. The business update included a discussion about how SAP would react in the\nevent of interruptions to its energy supply. The Executive Board explained to the Committee how\nSAP was currently protecting its data centers and for which scenarios the Company was preparing\nitself, including in the case of hyperscalers and their server systems, which would likewise be\naffected by energy bottlenecks.\nThe work of the committees and their regular reports to the full Supervisory Board ensured that we\nwere kept fully informed of all matters covered by the committees and were able to discuss them\nthoroughly.\n26/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nConflicts of Interest\nMembers of the Supervisory Board and of the Executive Board had no conflicts of interest that\nrecommendations E.1 and E.2 of the GCGC require to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board. Insofar\nas Supervisory Board members hold executive positions in companies or have material equity in\ncompanies that currently have business dealings with SAP, we do not see any impairment of their\nindependence. The scope of these transactions is relatively small and, moreover, takes place at arm\u2019s\nlength.\nTraining and Professional Development\nThe members of the Supervisory Board were once again offered various training and professional\ndevelopment opportunities throughout the year, with appropriate support from the Company. On-\nboarding sessions and leaflets are available for new Supervisory Board members to familiarize\nthemselves with their tasks and responsibilities when they assume office. Where it made sense,\npresentations and training offerings were recorded and placed on a specially configured training\nplatform to enable the remaining Supervisory Board members to take part in them as well. The\nmembers of the Audit and Compliance Committee were invited to short seminars in April 2022 on\n\u201cNew EU reporting requirements for sustainability\u201d (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), and\non the \u201cOECD/G20 New World Tax Order for Digital Business\u201d (a basic approach adopted by\nOECD/G20 to reform international business taxation). An external expert attending the Supervisory\nBoard\u2019s meeting in October provided a general overview of the importance of sustainability for\ncompanies and the expectation of investors where this was concerned. In December 2022, external\nexperts held an information session for members of the Supervisory Board on the future legal\nframework in the area of ESG and its relevance for the work of the Supervisory Board.\nSAP SE and Consolidated Financial Reports for 2022\nKPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Berlin (KPMG) audited the SAP SE and consolidated\nfinancial reports for 2022. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders elected KPMG as the SAP SE\nand SAP Group auditor on May 18, 2022. The Supervisory Board proposed the appointment of KPMG\non the recommendation of the Audit and Compliance Committee. Prior to the proposed resolution\nbeing put to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, KPMG had confirmed to the chairperson of\nthe Supervisory Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee that circumstances did not exist that\nmight prejudice or raise any doubt concerning its independence as the Company\u2019s auditor. In that\nconnection, KPMG informed us of the volume of the services that were not part of the audit which it\nhad either provided to the Group in the past year or was engaged to provide in the year to come. The\nSupervisory Board has agreed with KPMG that the auditor should report to the Supervisory Board and\nrecord in the auditor\u2019s report any fact found during the audit that is inconsistent with the declaration\ngiven by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board concerning implementation of the German\nCorporate Governance Code. KPMG examined the SAP SE financial statements prepared in\naccordance with the German Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements prepared in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as required by the German\nCommercial Code, section 315e, and the combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report\nprepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code, and certified them without qualification.\nThe auditor thus confirmed that, in its opinion and based on its audit in accordance with the\napplicable accounting principles, the SAP SE and consolidated financial statements give a true and\nfair view of the net assets, financial position, and results of operations of SAP SE and the SAP Group.\nThe auditor also confirmed that the combined SAP SE and SAP Group management report is\nconsistent with the corresponding financial statements and as a whole gives a suitable view of the\nposition of SAP SE and the SAP Group and of foreseeable opportunities and risks. In accordance with\nsection 317 (3a) of the German Commercial Code, the auditor also examined and confirmed that the\nrenderings of the financial statements, the management report, the consolidated financial statements,\nand the combined management report contained in the files submitted on an electronic data carrier,\nwhich can be accessed by the issuer on the secure client portal, and prepared for the purposes of\n27/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\ndisclosure comply in all material respects with the requirements of section 328 (1) of the German\nCommercial Code regarding the electronic reporting format (\u201cESEF format\u201d). KPMG had completed its\naudit of SAP\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and certified without qualification that it\ncomplies with the applicable U.S. standards. The auditor stated in its opinion that it considers SAP's\ninternal controls with respect to the consolidated financial statements to be effective in all material\nrespects. Additionally, it provided assurance on the non-financial declaration and the disclosures\ncontained therein on the topics identified as material \u2013 namely, the environment, employees, human\nrights, corruption and bribery, customer loyalty, and data privacy and data security \u2013 in the combined\nmanagement report, and on the separate review of the compensation report and selected qualitative\nand quantitative sustainability disclosures outside of the financial statements and management report.\nAll Audit and Compliance Committee members and Supervisory Board members received \u2013 initially in\nthe form of drafts that were identical to the final documents \u2013 the documents concerning the financial\nstatements mentioned above, the audit reports prepared by KPMG, and the Executive Board\u2019s\nproposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings in good time. On February 22, 2023, the\nExecutive Board prepared the financial accounts of SAP SE and the Group for 2022, comprising the\nSAP SE financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management\nreport, and submitted them without delay to the Supervisory Board.\nThe Executive Board explained the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group and its\nproposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings at the meeting of the Audit and\nCompliance Committee on February 22, 2023 (based on the drafts identical to the final documents)\nand at the meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 22, 2023. Members of the Executive Board\nanswered questions from the Committee and the Supervisory Board. At the Audit and Compliance\nCommittee meeting, they also explained the compensation report and the Annual Report on Form 20-\nF prepared in accordance with the applicable U.S. standards.\nAfter the Executive Board had explained them, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the\nSupervisory Board reviewed the financial statement documents (based on drafts identical to the final\ndocuments), taking KPMG\u2019s audit reports (or the drafts identical to the final documents) into account.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee then passed the compensation report on to the Supervisory\nBoard for release. The representative of the auditor who attended presented full reports on the audit\nand the results of the audit to the Audit and Compliance Committee and Supervisory Board meetings\nand explained its audit reports (or final drafts thereof). The auditor also reported that it had not\nidentified any material weaknesses in SAP\u2019s internal control and risk-management systems for\nfinancial reporting. Both the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board asked\ndetailed questions about the form, scope, and results of the audit. The Audit and Compliance\nCommittee reported to the Supervisory Board on its own review of the financial statements of SAP SE\nand the SAP Group, its discussions with the Executive Board and with the auditor, and its supervision\nof the financial reporting process. It confirmed that, as part of its supervisory work, it had addressed\nthe SAP Group\u2019s internal control, risk management, and internal auditing systems, and found the\nsystems to be effective.\nThe Committee also reported that KPMG had told it that no circumstances had arisen that might give\ncause for concern about KPMG\u2019s impartiality, and informed us about the services KPMG had provided\nthat were not part of the audit. The Committee reported that it had examined the auditor's\nindependence, taking the non-audit services it had rendered into consideration, and stated that, in the\nCommittee\u2019s opinion, the auditor possessed the required degree of independence and professional\nqualification.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board satisfied themselves that KPMG\nhad conducted the audit properly. In particular, they concluded that both the audit reports and the\naudit itself fulfilled the legal requirements. On the basis of the report and the Audit and Compliance\nCommittee\u2019s recommendation, the Supervisory Board approved the results of the audit and, since\nthere were no findings from our own examination, we gave our consent to the SAP SE financial\nstatements, the consolidated financial statements, the combined Group management report, and\nadopted the compensation report pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, section 162. The\n28/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nfinancial statements and combined management report were thus formally adopted upon approval by\nthe Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board\u2019s opinion of the Company and the Group coincided\nwith that of the Executive Board as set out in the combined management report. The Supervisory\nBoard considered the proposal presented by the Executive Board concerning the appropriation of\nretained earnings. We had regard to the requirements of dividends policy, the effects on the liquidity of\nSAP SE and the SAP Group, and the interests of the shareholders. We also discussed these matters\nwith the auditor. We then endorsed the Executive Board\u2019s proposal concerning the appropriation of\nretained earnings, in accordance with the Audit and Compliance Committee's recommendation. The\ncorporate governance statement pursuant to the German Commercial Code, sections 315d and 289f\nwas approved for publication by the Supervisory Board by way of correspondence vote prior to the\nmeeting to discuss the financial statements. Finally, we adopted this present Report.\nChanges on the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in 2022\nThere were no changes on our Executive Board in 2022. The appointment of the new CFO as\ndescribed above will only come into effect in 2023.\nThe Supervisory Board bade farewell in 2022 to Bernard Liautaud who, after 14 years as a member,\nresigned from his position with effect from the closing of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders\non May 18, 2022. The Supervisory Board thanks Bernard Liautaud for his commitment to SAP. On\nMay 18, 2022, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders elected Jennifer Li to the Supervisory\nBoard as his successor.\nIn addition to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we now face major challenges from the war in\nUkraine and its humanitarian, geopolitical, and economic implications. The Supervisory Board thanks\nthe members of the Executive Board and all SAP employees for their tireless commitment to SAP\nunder these extraordinary circumstances.\nFor the Supervisory Board\nProfessor Hasso Plattner\n(Chairperson)\n29/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nIndependent Assurance\nPractitioner's Report\nTo the Supervisory Board of SAP SE, Walldorf\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement of SAP SE\n(further \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cSAP\u201d) and on the non-financial statement of the parent company that is\ncombined with it, which are published in the Management Report, (further \u201ccombined non-financial\nstatement\u201d) for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022.\nResponsibilities of Management\nManagement of the company is responsible for the preparation of the combined non-financial\nstatement in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB\n[\u201cHandelsgesetzbuch\u201d: German Commercial Code] and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of June 18, 2020 on establishing a framework\nto facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \"EU\nTaxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own\ninterpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated\nacts adopted thereunder as set out in section \u201cSustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures\u201d of the\ncombined non-financial statement.\nThis responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting\nmethods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the\ngroup that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, management is responsible for such\ninternal control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a combined non-financial\nstatement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms\nthat are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not\nyet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section \u201cSustainable Finance:\nEU Taxonomy Disclosures\u201d of the combined non-financial statement. They are responsible for the\ndefensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be\ninterpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\nIndependence and Quality Assurance of the Assurance\nPractitioner\u2019s firm\nWe have complied with the independence and quality assurance requirements set out in the national\nlegal provisions and professional pronouncements, in particular the Professional Code for German\nPublic Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the\nGerman Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance\nrequirements in audit practice (IDW QS 1).\nResponsibility of the Assurance Practitioner\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the combined non-financial\nstatement based on our assurance engagement.\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance\nEngagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of\n41/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nHistorical Financial Information\" issued by the IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform\nthe assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our\nattention that cause us to believe that the company's non-financial statement, is not prepared, in all\nmaterial respects, in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the\nEU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by\nmanagement disclosed in section \u201cSustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures\u201d of the combined\nnon-financial statement. We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure.\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable\nassurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The\nselection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance\npractitioner.\nIn the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following\nassurance procedures and other activities:\n\u2013 Interviewing employees responsible for the materiality analysis at group level in order to obtain an\nunderstanding on the approach for identifying key issues and related reporting limits of SAP,\n\u2013 Carrying out a risk assessment, inclusive of media analysis, on relevant information on\nsustainability performance of SAP in the reporting period,\n\u2013 Assessing the design and implementation of systems and processes for identifying, handling, and\nmonitoring information on environmental, employee and social matters, human rights and\ncombating corruption and bribery, including the consolidation of data,\n\u2013 Interviewing staff on group level, who are responsible for the disclosures on concepts, due\ndiligence processes, results and risks, the performance of internal control activities and the\nconsolidation of the disclosures,\n\u2013 Inspecting selected internal and external documents,\n\u2013 Analytically assessing the data and trends of the quantitative information, which is reported on\ngroup level of all locations,\n\u2013 Evaluating the local data collection, validation, and reporting processes as well as the reliability of\nthe reported data by means of a sampling survey at two locations,\n\u2013 Interviewing of responsible staff on group level to obtain an understanding of the approach to\nidentify relevant economic activities in accordance with the EU taxonomy,\n\u2013 Evaluating the design and implementation of systems and procedures for identifying, processing,\nand monitoring information on turnover, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for the\ntaxonomy-relevant economic activities for the first two environmental objectives climate change\nmitigation and climate change adaptation,\n\u2013 Evaluating the data collection, validation, and reporting processes, as well as the reliability of the\nreported data for the taxonomy-aligned economic activities in conjunction with the assessment of\nthe technical evaluation criteria for the substantial contribution, the fulfilment of the DNSH-criteria\nand the documentation of the minimum safeguard,\n\u2013 Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures.\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation,\nmanagement is required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined\nlegal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly,\nour assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\nAssurance Opinion\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our\nattention that causes us to believe that the combined non-financial statement of SAP SE, Walldorf for\n42/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nthe period from January 1 to December 31, 2022 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in\naccordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by management as\ndisclosed in section \u201cSustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures\u201d of the combined non-financial\nstatement.\nRestriction of Use\nThis assurance report is solely addressed to SAP SE, Walldorf.\nOur assignment for SAP SE, Walldorf and professional liability is governed by the General\nEngagement Terms for Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditors) and Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs-\ngesellschaften (German Public Audit Firms) (Allgemeine Auftragsbedingungen f\u00fcr Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer\nund Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaften) in the version dated January 1, 2017\n(https://www.kpmg.de/bescheinigungen/lib/aab_english.pdf). By reading and using the information\ncontained in this assurance report, each recipient confirms having taken note of provisions of the\nGeneral Engagement Terms (including the limitation of our liability for negligence to EUR 4 million as\nstipulated in No. 9) and accepts the validity of the attached General Engagement Terms with respect\nto us.\nMannheim, den 22. Februar 2023\nKPMG AG\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\nBeyer Wiegand\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer\n[German Public Auditor] [German Public Auditor]\n43/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nNon-Financial Statement\nIncluding Information on\nSustainable Activities\nWith this section and the information referenced to in this section, SAP SE fulfills its duty to produce a\nnon-financial statement (NFS) for the holding company, pursuant to section 289b\u2013e of the German\nCommercial Code (HGB), and a non-financial group statement, pursuant to section 315b\u2013c in\nconjunction with section 289c\u2013e of the German Commercial Code (HGB), in the form of a combined\nnon-financial statement. The relevant non-financial matters are referenced in the table below and can\nbe found in the relevant sections of our combined management report.\nAdditionally, following Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof the European Union (EU Taxonomy), we have included information on how and to what extent\nSAP\u2019s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable\nunder this regulation.\nFor more information, see the EU Taxonomy Disclosures subsection.\nReporting Framework\nThe social and environmental data and information included in the SAP Integrated Report have been\nprepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.\nBusiness Model\nSAP\u2019s business model is described in the Strategy and Business Model section of the combined\nmanagement report. Good governance is a prerequisite for continued success and is described\nthroughout the combined management report. Therefore, we did not include governance as an\nindividual material topic in our materiality assessment and our non-financial statement.\n94/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nNon-Financial Disclosures in SAP\u2019s Combined Management Report\nSAP determines which non-financial information has to be disclosed based on a materiality analysis\nwe perform using internal and external input. For more information, see Materiality in the Further\nInformation about Economic, Environmental, and Social Performance section in our SAP Integrated\nReport.\nThe individual non-financial aspects to be covered by the non-financial statement are addressed in\nthe following sections of our combined management report if material. No material risks according to\nsection 289c (3) sentence numbers 3 and 4 HGB have been identified.\nDue Diligence; Policies and Measures and Results, Including References to Financial Statements\nGuidelines (Concepts) KPIs Relevant for Steering and and Notes\nCompensation\n\nThe criteria for Taxonomy-alignment of activity 8.1 were not met in fiscal year 2022. We expect that the transition from Taxonomy-eligible to Taxonomy-aligned will progress over the next few years\ncorresponding to the fulfillment of the technical screening criteria. For instance, according to the EU Taxonomy regulation, refrigerants used in data centers need to conform with a certain level of\nglobal warming potential. The refrigerants employed by SAP do not meet this threshold yet. An immediate exchange would lead to additional toxic waste and costs. Therefore, SAP intends to\nreplace the refrigerants according to our regular maintenance schedule over the course of the next few years. Also, SAP\u2019s data center co-locations and hyperscalers are not yet in full alignment\nwith the criteria set out in the Taxonomy regulation. Together with our providers, we are evaluating options to reach Taxonomy alignment over the next few years.\nFurthermore, SAP assessed whether any capital and operational expenditures had been incurred related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned economic\nactivities. In 2022, SAP capitalized an amount of \u20ac151 million relating to the purchase of vehicles. While a portion of these expenses, specifically relating to the purchase of electric vehicles, may\nbe Taxonomy-aligned, we could not obtain the necessary verification from our suppliers. Therefore, SAP classified the full amount as Taxonomy-eligible (purchases of output of the activity \u201c3.3\nManufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" contributing to climate change mitigation) but not as Taxonomy-aligned.\nIn single locations, SAP operates combined heat/cool and power generation facilities using fossil gaseous fuels. However, the associated potential Taxonomy-eligible and aligned revenues, capital\nexpenditures, and operational expenditures are negligible. No further activities for nuclear or gas are applicable.\nSAP also evaluated whether activity \u201c7.2 Renovation of existing buildings\u201d is relevant for SAP. While SAP regularly conducts renovation measures, for 2022 renovation expenses were considered\nimmaterial compared to SAP\u2019s total investments and were not clearly distinguishable from other related but non-eligible costs. We therefore concluded that activity 7.2 is not relevant for 2022.\n96/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nBusiness Conduct\nVision and Strategy\nIn an increasingly complex business environment, making the right decisions and abiding by ethical\nchoices has never been more important. As a company operating in numerous countries across the\nglobe, SAP is required to adhere to strict international legislation that defines acceptable business\nconduct and practices.\nAt SAP, we also expect our business practices to not only meet international rules and legal\nrequirements, but to adhere to our internal high standards of ethics and integrity. We understand that\nour customers expect this as well. SAP\u2019s reputation for doing business the right way is one of our most\nimportant assets. By striving to make ethical choices and acting with integrity, we aim to continue to\ngrow SAP in a way that meets both our own and our customers\u2019 high ethical expectations.\nDue Diligence\nGovernance\n\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nOutside SAP, the OEC regularly exchanges ideas and best practices for compliance processes with\nrelevant peers in the software industry and beyond. In Germany, the OEC participates in the annual\nDAX Chief Compliance Officer Round Table. SAP is also a Corporate Member of the Association of\nCertified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), and the GCCO is also a member of the European Chief\nCompliance Officers Forum (ECCIOF) and the UN Global Compact\u2019s Think Lab focused on\ntransformational governance.\nGuidelines and Policies\nIn 2022, a revised and updated version of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (CoEBC)55 was\nrolled out throughout the Company and made available outside of SAP. It replaced multiple existing\nlocal Codes of Business Conduct and provides, in a single document, the primary ethical and legal\nframework within which SAP conducts business and remains on course for success. The revised\nCoEBC is available in 22 languages.\nSAP also expects all partners and suppliers to commit to meeting our high standards of integrity and\nsustainability. For this reason, we have the SAP Partner Code of Conduct and the SAP Supplier Code\nof Conduct in place so that partners and suppliers understand what is expected of them.\nHow We Measure and Manage Our Performance\nEnforcing Policies and Guidelines\nAll employees are bound by the CoEBC; they are required to acknowledge its contents and confirm\ntheir commitment to it on an annual basis. In 2022, we continued to monitor employee certification of\nthe CoEBC for employees worldwide, recording a 99.9% certification rate for permanent SAP\nemployees (excluding those from acquired companies).\nCommunication\nThe OEC\u2019s dedicated communications team consistently distributes integrity-related communications,\nat all levels of the Company \u2013 including to senior leaders, managers, and employees, as well as topic-\nrelated content for SAP partners. Executive Board members and senior leaders regularly host all-\nhands meetings as well as leadership team meetings and smaller gatherings, which include integrity-\nfocused topics, demonstrating their dedication to ethical business.\nQuarterly OEC newsletters provide all SAP employees with information on a range of compliance-\nrelated topics. Additionally, a quarterly newsletter with a focus on leadership and management topics\nis sent specifically to executive and senior management.\nEmployees can use the SAP One employee portal at any time to access all global policies, guidelines,\nand additional information. The SAP Compliance mobile app56 also provides convenient, ongoing\naccess to compliance-related information. Externally, our Web site sap.com features information and\nguidance for our external stakeholders.\nAll Board areas have re-committed their support for OEC\u2019s Compliance Ambassador Program and\nhave nominated employees to participate in it. In 2022, a fifth cohort was introduced, bringing the\nnumber of participants from over 500 in 2021 to over 1,100 in 2022. The program is designed to give\nemployees a further point of contact in the business when compliance matters arise. Ambassadors\nparticipate in an extensive curriculum of monthly on-boarding sessions over an 18-month period. They\nare expected to cascade and transfer information on the importance of compliance and ethics\nthroughout their teams and lines of business.\n55 Link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by\nour external auditor.\n\nSpeak Out at SAP is SAP\u2019s independently managed whistleblower reporting tool, through which any\nmatters or concerns can be reported easily, and, if desired, anonymously. The tool is available\n24 hours a day, seven days a week, both internally to SAP employees and externally to concerned\nparties, including customers, suppliers, and partners.\nReports may be submitted either directly by the reporter through the Internet-based portal, or by\nphone, with local language support across the globe in order to maximize accessibility for reporters. In\nall cases, SAP continues to maintain a strict non-retaliation policy.\nCompared with the previous whistleblower reporting tool, we observed a substantial increase in the\nnumber of concerns reported through Speak Out at SAP since the tool\u2019s launch in 2021. Within this\nincrease, a number of the concerns raised came from external parties, such as partners, customers,\nand suppliers.\nBeyond Speak Out at SAP, we provide further reporting channels, including an internal ticketing\nsystem, a postal address for written submissions, as well as local contact persons worldwide.\nInvestigating Misconduct\nThe OEC\u2019s investigations team is comprised of dedicated investigators who probe allegations of\nmisconduct within the OEC\u2019s area of responsibility. Where appropriate, the OEC engages the\nassistance of an external law firm when examining conduct that may violate SAP\u2019s policies and\n57 Excludes employees on parental leave, long-term sick leave, sabbaticals, and on early retirement. Training last assigned in 2021 with\nbiennial frequency.\n124/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nprocedures or applicable laws. When misconduct is substantiated, SAP takes proportionate\ndisciplinary action.\nFor more information about the material allegations currently being investigated by the OEC, see the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.3).\nRelated Risks for SAP\nThe actions and processes to address risks in business conduct are described above. No material\nrisks were identified regarding the non-financial risk assessment. For financial risks, see also Ethical\nBehavior in the Risk Management and Risks section.\nAudit Scope\nThe content of the Business Conduct section was not subject to the statutory audit of the combined\ngroup management report. However, our external auditor performed an independent limited\nassurance engagement for the content of this section.\n125/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nRisk Management and Risks\nOur Risk Management\nInternal Control and Risk Management Systems\nAs a global company, SAP is exposed to a broad range of risks across our business operations.\nConsequently, our Executive Board has established comprehensive internal control and risk\nmanagement structures that enable us to identify and analyze risks early and take appropriate action.\nOur internal control and risk management systems are designed to identify potential events that could\nnegatively impact the Company and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the operating\neffectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting.\nThese systems comprise numerous control mechanisms and are an essential element of our\ncorporate decision-making process; they are therefore implemented across the entire Group as an\nintegral part of SAP\u2019s business processes. We have adopted an integrated internal control and risk\nmanagement approach to help maintain appropriate and effective global risk management while also\nenabling us to aggregate risks and report on them transparently.\nAppropriateness and Effectiveness of SAP\u2019s Entire Internal Control and Risk\nManagement System62\nWe have a governance model in place across the internal control and risk management systems, as\nwell as a central software solution to store, maintain, and report all risk-relevant information. In the\nBusiness Conduct section of our combined management report, we describe in more detail the\ngovernance structure as well as the measures and guidelines SAP has implemented to ensure\ncompliance not only with international rules and legal requirements but also with our internal\nstandards of ethics and integrity. Furthermore, SAP monitors risks relating to material sustainability\nmatters. Material non-financial topics are listed in the section Non-Financial Statement Including\nInformation on Sustainable Activities. The governance model, policies, and guidelines as well as the\ncontrol measures we have implemented relative to these topics are described in the respective\nchapters in this combined management report. SAP constantly reviews and adjusts its entire internal\ncontrol and risk management system as well as the policies and guidelines we have implemented\nregarding the material sustainability topics. We considered the results from external audits, such as\nthe audit of our internal control system for financial reporting and early risk detection system\nconducted by our auditor KPMG, as well as internal sources, such as audit reports from our Global\nRisk & Assurance Services (GR&AS) team, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control and risk\nmanagement systems. If issues are identified, SAP takes remedial action. While the non-financial\ninternal control system has not yet reached the same maturity level as the financial internal control\nsystem, no material indication has come to our attention that SAP\u2019s entire internal control and risk\nmanagement system is not appropriate or effective.\nLegal and Regulatory Requirements\nDue to our public listings in both Germany and the United States, we are subject to both German and\nU.S. regulatory requirements that relate to internal controls and risk management over financial\nreporting, such as provisions in the German Stock Corporation Act, section 91 (2), the U.S. Sarbanes-\nOxley Act (SOX) of 2002, specifically sections 302 and 404, and the German Corporate Governance\nCode. Hence, our Executive Board has established an early warning system (risk management\nsystem) to enable compliance with applicable regulations.\n62 The appropriateness and effectiveness of SAP\u2019s entire internal control and risk management system, except for the internal control\nsystem for financial reporting and early risk detection system, was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance\nengagement performed by our external auditor.\n129/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nRisk Management Policy and Framework\nThe risk management policy issued by our Executive Board governs how we manage risk in line with\nthe Company\u2019s risk appetite and defines a methodology that is applied uniformly across all parts of\nthe Group.\n\nOur Global Risk Management Governance Framework\nThe risk management governance framework at SAP represents a comprehensive system of\napproaches and processes to ensure control through a clearly structured risk management system\nand a supporting risk culture. The risk culture is considered the basis of SAP\u2019s risk management\nsystem. Risk culture at SAP comprises a system of values, beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and\nunderstanding concerning risks and risk management as part of our corporate culture. To support and\ncontinuously foster SAP\u2019s risk culture, we conduct risk activities for the entire SAP organization such\nas mandatory training in ethical behavior, code of conduct, and risk management.\nOur Executive Board is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the internal control system and\nour risk management system. The effectiveness of both systems and their implementation in the\ndifferent Board areas is monitored by each Executive Board member. The Audit and Compliance\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board regularly monitors the effectiveness of SAP\u2019s internal control and\nrisk management systems. Our GR&AS organization regularly provides a status update on the internal\ncontrol and the risk management systems to the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Supervisory\nBoard. Every year, SAP\u2019s external auditors assess whether the SAP Group early-warning system for\nrisk detection is adequate to identify risks that might endanger our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Additional assurance is obtained through the external audit of the effectiveness of our\nsystem of internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur Corporate Financial Reporting (CFR) department codifies all accounting and reporting policies in\nour Group accounting and global revenue recognition guidelines. These policies and the corporate\n131/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nclosing schedule, together with our process descriptions, define the closing process. Under this\nclosing process, we prepare, predominately through centralized or external services, the financial\nstatements of all SAP entities for consolidation by CFR. CFR and other corporate departments are\nresponsible for ensuring compliance with Group accounting policies and monitor the accounting work.\nCFR reviews accounting standards and processes to ensure applicable updates are made to SAP\u2019s\nfinancial reporting.\n\nMoreover, protecting and defending our intellectual property is crucial to our success. The outcome of\nlitigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\ndependency in the aggregate on third-party technology, including cloud and Web services, that we\nembed in our products or that we resell to our customers; integration of open source software\ncomponents from third parties into our software and the implications derived from it; inability to\nprevent third parties from obtaining, using, or selling without authorization what we regard as our\nproprietary technology and information; and the possibility that third parties might reverse-engineer or\notherwise obtain and use technology and information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, the\nlaws and courts of certain countries might not offer effective means to enforce our legal or intellectual\nproperty rights. Finally, SAP may not be able to collect all judgments awarded to it in legal\nproceedings. The outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.\nManagement\u2019s view of the litigation might also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and\nother claims or lawsuits could differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods,\nwhich are the basis for our accounting for these litigations and claims under IFRS.\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse\neffects. For example, we: have various internal programs, such as internal policies, processes, and\nmonitoring in place to assess and manage the risks associated with open source and third-party\nintellectual property; endeavor to protect ourselves in the respective third-party software agreements\nby obtaining certain rights in case such agreements are terminated; and are a party to certain patent\ncross-license agreements with third parties.\n\nNon-compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws by SAP or any of the subprocessors\nengaged by SAP within the processing of personal data could lead to risks. These include, among\nothers: mandatory disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, customers, and data protection\nsupervisory authorities; investigations and administrative measures by data protection supervisory\nauthorities, such as the instruction to alter or stop non-compliant data processing activities, including\nthe instruction to stop using non-compliant subprocessors; or the possibility of damage claims by\ncustomers and individuals, contract terminations, and potential fines.\nIn addition, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and security industry\nexperts continue to warn of risks related to a globally growing number of cybersecurity attacks aimed\nat obtaining or violating company data including personal data.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial\nperformance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse\neffects. For example, we: have implemented internal processes and measures to enable SAP to\ncomply successfully and sufficiently with applicable data protection requirements; anchor data\nprotection requirements in the mandatory product standards of SAP\u2019s product development lifecycle;\ncontinuously review SAP\u2019s existing standards and policies to address changes to applicable laws and\nregulations; continuously enhance our data center operations worldwide; actively monitor legal\ndevelopments; engage with political stakeholders and government authorities; and provide clear\ngovernance and guidance on data handling, processing standards, and external communication as\npart of our data management framework, specifically incorporating aspects of new technologies such\nas those represented in embedded intelligence applications.\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor\nwere to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and\nclassify this risk factor as medium.\nCorporate Governance and Compliance Risks\nEthical Behavior: Our global business exposes us to risks related to unethical behavior and\nnon-compliance with policies by employees, other individuals, partners, third parties, or\nentities associated with SAP.\nSAP\u2019s leadership position in the global market is founded on the long-term and sustainable trust of\nour stakeholders worldwide. Our overarching approach is one of corporate transparency, open\ncommunication with financial markets, regulators, and authorities, and adherence to recognized\nstandards of business integrity. This commitment to recognized standards of business integrity is\nformalized in SAP\u2019s CoEBC and supporting guidelines.\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: non-\ncompliance with our policies and violation of compliance related rules, regulations, and legal\nrequirements including, but not limited to, anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation in Germany, the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt\nconduct; unethical and fraudulent behavior leading to criminal charges, fines, and claims by affected\nparties; collusion with external third parties; fraud and corruption; public sector transactions in\nterritories exposed to a high risk of corruption; or increased exposure and impact on business\nactivities in highly regulated industries.\n137/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022\nTo Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional\nStakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand,\ncompetitive or financial position, share price, profit, and cash flows.\nSAP has encountered situations that required clear messaging and strong action on non-compliance\nin the context of corrupt behavior that has the potential to harm our business and reputation. SAP is\ncontinuing to investigate its dealings with the public sector.\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse\neffects. For example, we: continuously evolve our comprehensive compliance program based on the\nthree pillars of prevention, detection, and response; improve associated business processes, to\nprevent further and future violations; review partner business models, to mitigate risks of corruption\nwhile meeting agility requirements; conduct internal audits of our compliance programs related to\nbribery, corruption, and substantial fraud; annually reconfirm commitment to the CoEBC by SAP\u2019s\nworkforce (except where disallowed by local legal regulations); implement compliance policies and\nprocesses aimed at managing third parties and preventing misuse of third-party payments for illegal\npurposes, including the performance of compliance due diligence activities prior to the engagement of\nthird parties; and launched a Partner Integrity Initiative aimed at examining the compliance programs\nof partners in SAP\u2019s ecosystem and reviewing the SAP-related deals closed by them. We also\nintroduced a platform called \"Speak Out at SAP\" for anyone within and outside of SAP to raise\nconfidentially and, if desired, anonymously their concerns on ethics and compliance related to our\nCoEBC and any law or regulation.\nDespite our comprehensive and continuously evolving compliance programs and internal controls,\nintentional efforts of individuals to circumvent controls or engage in corruption, especially by way of\ncollusion with other involved parties, cannot always be prevented.\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor\nwere to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and\nclassify this risk fact.\nThe image you uploaded appears to be a table that organizes and details various non-financial reporting segments for a company, structured across four key areas: Environmental Matters, Employee Matters, Human Rights, and Anti-Corruption and Bribery Matters.

Key steps include:   - SAP's compliance procedures, including the new Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (CoEBC), are intended to meet both international regulations and SAP's own high standards of ethics and integrity.\n   - SAP undertakes frequent risk assessments to identify and address potential compliance problems, particularly in high-risk jurisdictions. This requires doing extensive assessments and developing mitigation strategies utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data.\n   - SAP's Internal Control System (ICS) is assessed annually to ensure that risk scenarios are appropriately presented and that appropriate controls are in place. This system is connected to SAP's business operations and supported by a central risk management.\n   - The Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC) is reliable to SAP's success by implementing a culture of integrity and addressing compliance issues through new regulations.\n   - The CoEBC is introduced to all employees and partners. The CoEBC is available in 22 languages and requires annual recognition from employees.\n   - SAP uses a variety of media, including newsletters, internal portals, and a specialized mobile app, to ensure ongoing communication on compliance issues.\n   - \"Speak Out at SAP\" is a whistleblower tool that is always available  for  internal and external stakeholders to anonymously raise problems. This system was effetely used in the past, which demonstrates the effectiveness.\nSAP ensures the independence of its investigation processes by taking the following actions.\n   - The Group Chief Compliance Officer is directly reporting to the CEO, safeguarding independence from operational management. Global compliance officers are the primary point of contact for compliance issues. Compliance issues are reviewed at quarterly Audit and Compliance Committee meetings. The GCCO often hires outside attorneys and forensic specialists for high-risk assessments and investigations.\n   - The whistleblower system enforces stringent non-retaliation policies, encouraging individuals to disclose misconduct without fear of retaliation. This independence is critical for conducting fair investigations.\n\nSAP's anti-corruption and anti-bribery training programs are comprehensive, covering a wide range of topics and assuring significant employee participation.\n\n   - SAP requires four online compliance training courses for all workers, with additional training for high-risk areas. In 2022, new mandatory training for employees in the Customer Success Board sector were launched, with a completion rate of more than 99.9%.\n   - The Ethical Leadership session was provided live to all People Managers, with a global completion rate of 99 percent.\n\nSAP Training Covers High-Risk Functions: Field compliance officers customize courses to workers' roles and responsibilities, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This guarantees that personnel in high-risk positions are well-informed and alert.\n   - The Compliance Ambassador Program has grown tremendously, demonstrating SAP's commitment to deepening compliance culture throughout the firm. Over 1,100 people participated in 2022, up from 500 in 2021.\n\nSAP SE's ESG report demonstrates a thorough and effective approach to avoiding, detecting, and combating corruption and bribery. The organization has effective systems and rules in place, as well as clear communication methods, independent investigative procedures, and significant training programs. \nThe ESG report meets G1-3 regulatory criteria, proving SAP's dedication to ethical behavior and compliance. However, ongoing transparency and updates on the effectiveness of these efforts will be critical to ensuring regulatory compliance and stakeholder confidence.

The process-integrated safeguarding\nmeasures are organizational measures, on the one hand, and control measures, on the other. The Supervisory\nBoard, specifically in this case the Audit Committee of Sartorius AG, and the Group Auditing Department are\ninvolved in the Sartorius Group\u2019s internal control system through their non-process-integrated audit activities.\nThe Audit Committee regularly reviews quarterly reports in addition to the annual financial statements of the\nparent corporation and the consolidated annual financial statements.\nMoreover, to ensure systematic, early identification of risks across the entire Group, a \u201cmonitoring system for\nearly group-wide detection of risks with the potential to jeopardize the company\u2019s continued existence\u201d as\ndefined in Section 91(2), of the German Stock Corporation Law (AktG) is in place at the Sartorius Group. The\nefficacy of the early risk detection system, which the Sartorius Group adapts promptly in response to any\nrelevant changes in circumstances, is assessed by the independent auditors of Sartorius AG in accordance\nwith Section 317(4), of the German Commercial Code (HGB). An integral component of this system is also\noperational risk management, which involves activities such as the transfer of risk to insurance companies\nthrough coverage for damage and liability risks, and the arrangement of suitable hedges to limit currency risks\nand interest rate risks.\nOrganizational Measures\nAccounting processes are strictly organized according to the principle of segregation of functions and comply\nwith the \"four-eyes\" principle \u2013 i.e., review by at least two individuals, also referred to as the dual-review or\nmultiple-review principle. Duties and responsibilities are clearly assigned to different specialized departments\nand companies. The separation of administrative, executive, settlement, and approval functions reduces the\npossibility of fraud. It also continues to play a significant role in ensuring that any possible errors are discovered\nearly and any potential misconduct is prevented.\nThe IT applications used in the company\u2019s accounting processes have access restrictions, which allow only\nauthorized persons to have controlled access to the accounting system and data. Each access right is assigned\nspecifically according to the tasks to be performed and is subject to annual review. Furthermore, the dual-\nreview principle is also applied in IT process design and the assignment of access rights.\nStart Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Description of the Key Features of the Internal Control System 89\nIn addition, defined written local and global operating procedures exist that are regularly updated and\ncommunicated throughout the Group. The scope of regulation of the Group accounting guidelines extends\nto the central definition of valuation rules and parameters, among other aspects. Additional data for the\npresentation of external information in the notes to the financial statements and in the Group management\nreport is also prepared and aggregated at Group level.\nContinuous coordination of internal accounting during the year for planning and control with external\naccounting contributes significantly to the quality of Group financial reporting. Reporting itself is done\nthrough a standardized reporting system implemented throughout the Group. This system visualizes all\nconsolidation processes. Internal controls, on the one hand, and the Group auditors of Sartorius AG, on the\nother hand, ensure that Group financial reports are accurately generated from the consolidated Group\ncompanies\u2019 financial statements.\nThe employees involved in the accounting process meet qualitative standards and receive regular training.\nThe Group Financial Reporting Department assists the local units in resolving complex accounting issues,\nsuch as measuring fair value, to ensure consistent and accurate reporting in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Complex evaluations, such as actuarial calculations and company valuations or purchase price\nallocations, are assigned to specialized service providers who involve the respectively qualified in-house staff.\nControl Measures\nComprehensive control activities are performed by managers and staff to ensure effective and reliable\naccounting. As a result, this ensures compliance with legal requirements and internal guidelines as well as\nproperly conducted business transactions. Examples of such control activities include the analysis of situations\nand developments with reference to specific key indicators. Moreover, every month individual reporting units\ncomment on and explain special characteristics or variances using Group-wide standardized analytical tools\nas the basis. Further specific control activities performed to ensure effective and reliable Group accounting\nencompass the analysis and, where applicable, correction of the individual financial statements submitted by\nthe Sartorius Group companies. A large number of automated control mechanisms already incorporated into\nthe consolidated reporting system enable erroneous information to be identified and corrected at Group level.\nImpairment tests are conducted centrally for assets and/or cash-generating units considered material from\nthe Group's perspective in order to ensure that consistent, standardized evaluation criteria are applied.\nThe Group Auditing Department draws up a risk-based audit plan annually and reviews in spot checks whether\nbasic legal requirements and internal group guidelines are complied with for the entire control and risk\nmanagement system of the Group. This monitoring function covers, in particular, audits of the functional\nefficiency and effectiveness of defined control measures. The results of these audits are reported directly to\nthe audited departments and units, making it possible to efficiently remedy any identified deficiencies and to\nfurther enhance the company\u2019s internal control system (ICS). The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\nregularly receive reports on audit activities.\nThe main rules governing the organization of the internal control system are defined in a manual based on\nbusiness processes. This manual combines all ICS-relevant requirements that Group management considers\nof material importance into one standardized document and will be supplemented by further appropriate rules\nas necessary.\nStart Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Description of the Key Features of the Internal Control System 90\nQualifying Statements\nThe internal control and risk management system enables the complete recording, processing, and evaluation\nof company-related matters on the basis of the organizational, control, and monitoring structures defined in\nthe Sartorius Group, as well as their accurate presentation in Group accounting. Yet it must be considered that\nan internal control system, regardless of its design, cannot guarantee absolute certainty with regard to the\ncorrect and complete recording of facts in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe statements made relate solely to the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements of\nSartorius AG, provided that this parent company has direct or indirect control over such subsidiaries within the\nmeaning of the international accounting standards.\nStart Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Explanatory Report of the Executive Board on the Disclosures Pursuant to 91\nSections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB)\nExplanatory Report of the Executive\nBoard on the Disclosures Pursuant to\nSections 289a and 315a of the German\nCommercial Code (HGB)\nComposition of the Issued\nCapital|Limitations to Voting Rights\nSartorius AG\u2019s capital stock totals \u20ac74,880,000.

The Supervisory Board is not\nauthorized to take any operational management measures for the business. The Supervisory Board\u2019s rules of\nprocedure are published on the company\u2019s website.\nThe Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company.

The basic principles of the compliance\nmanagement system, which, in essence, is based on Sartorius\u2019 global Code of Conduct, are also explained in\nthe corporate governance statement on page 101 et seq.\nThe issue of anti-corruption is also a central component of the compliance management system. The related\nrequirements employees must comply with are laid out in a dedicated Anti-Corruption Code, and employees\nregularly receive training focused specifically on the contents of the Code.\nResults of the Concept\nIn fiscal 2022, 11,883 employees (previous year: 9,143 employees) completed the Code of Conduct training\nand 12,154 employees (previous year: 9,341 employees) completed the Anti-Corruption Code training.

Both new and existing suppliers are\nrequired to sign the updated Code of Conduct.\nIn fiscal 2022, Sartorius introduced a standardized, multi-stage process to assess supplier sustainability. This is\nbased on internal and external information and requires corrective measures to be taken in the event of non-\ncompliance. In order to discuss the results, the Bioprocess Solutions Division has already set up a risk\ncommittee in the current fiscal year, and the results are reported to this committee on a regular basis.\nThe new supplier evaluation process involves reviewing compliance with sustainability requirements using\nself-assessments based on standardized questionnaires via recognized sustainability platforms. For selected\nsuppliers, Sartorius engages independent on-site sustainability audits by external third parties. Furthermore,\nsustainability aspects are also part of the on-site quality audits conducted by Sartorius itself.\nThe sourcing departments are responsible for ensuring that suppliers are bound by the Code of Conduct and\nfor verifying compliance with the requirements. The quality departments are responsible for carrying out the\nquality audits.\nIn addition, Sartorius maintains a continuous dialogue with suppliers to promote their commitment to\nsustainability issues.\nResults of the Concept\nIn November 2022, the Bioprocess Solutions Division held a workshop with more than 50 selected,\ninternational suppliers at its main site in G\u00f6ttingen to discuss, among other issues, the topics of climate change\nmitigation and the implementation of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) and thereby make\nfurther progress in these areas.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 441 suppliers had signed the updated 2022 Code of Conduct for Business Partners\n(previous year: n.a.). This means that suppliers that have signed the 2022 Code of Conduct account for 12% of\nSartorius\u2019 total purchasing volume (previous year: n.a.). In addition, the company has received a total of 654\nvalid sustainability-related supplier self-assessments (previous year: 110). This means that suppliers that have\nsubmitted a self-assessment account for 49% of Sartorius\u2019 total purchasing volume (previous year: n.a.).\nFurthermore, the company carried out 125 of its own quality-related supplier audits that included sustainability\naspects (previous year: 107). External sustainability audits have not yet been carried out at any suppliers\u2019 sites,\nas the process was newly introduced in fiscal 2022.\nThe Bioprocess Solutions Division already completed the sustainability assessment for strategic suppliers in\nfiscal 2022. The company has since analyzed the results and, on this basis, defined corrective measures that\nare currently being implemented. In addition, Sartorius has begun the assessment of its nonstrategic suppliers.\nStart Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Non-financial Group Statement 122\nIndicators Supply Chain\nFY 2022 FY 20211\nSuppliers having signed the Code of Conduct for Business Partners 2022 441 n.a.\nCoverage purchasing volume in % 12 n.a.\nSustainability-related supplier self-assessments as of 31.12.2 654 110\nCoverage purchasing volume in %2 49 n.a.\nExternal sustainability-related supplier audits 0 n.a.\nCoverage purchasing volume in % 0 n.a.\nOwn quality-related supplier audits, which include sustainability aspects 125 107\n1 The data for fiscal 2021 was taken from the 2021 Non-financial Statement.\n2 Includes the available sustainability-related self-assessments via recognized sustainability platforms which, according to the\nplatform, are valid as of the reporting date or whose validity date is not older than two years.\nDisclosures Pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe EU taxonomy is a classification system for determining environmentally sustainable economic activities in\nthe real economy, combined with specific disclosure requirements for companies.\nThese relate to taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures, and operating\nexpenditures with respect to the EU\u2019s six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change\nadaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular\neconomy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nIn accordance with the simplified procedure granted by the EU Commission, the disclosure requirement for\nfiscal 2021 was initially limited to taxonomy-eligible turnover, capital expenditures, and operating expenditures\nfor the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. In this context,\nthe economic activities described in the Delegated Acts are considered to be taxonomy-eligible, as they make\na substantial contribution to the achievement of the EU\u2019s environmental objectives. Companies are required\nto disclose taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures, and operating expenditures for the first time for\nfiscal year 2022. Economic activities that meet the technical screening criteria and the minimum safeguards\ncriteria are considered to be taxonomy-aligned.\nThe following disclosures constitute the mandatory disclosures required of the Sartorius Group in accordance\nArticle 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 for fiscal 2022.\nSpecial Notes on Reporting\nLegal Framework\nPreparation of the required disclosures was fundamentally associated with uncertainties for Sartorius, in\nparticular because a number of unanswered questions currently still exist regarding the definition of\ntaxonomy-eligible economic activities, the interpretation of the technical screening criteria and the minimum\nsafeguard criteria, which have not yet been conclusively answered by the EU Commission. The company has\ntaken information into account that was available through January 31, 2023.\nStart Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Non-financial Group Statement 123\nMateriality approach\nCapital expenditures and operating expenditures were disclosed on the basis of materiality thresholds.\nEconomic activities that accounted for less than 1% of total taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures and\noperating expenditures were qualitatively assessed in terms of their significance for Sartorius. Amounts\nclassified as immaterial have been reported as not taxonomy-eligible and therefore were not subject to further\nassessment for taxonomy alignment. This applies to capital expenditures and operating expenditures related\nto activities 4.1 \u201cElectricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\u201d, 7.4 \u201cInstallation, maintenance and\nrepair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\u201d, and 8.1\n\u201cData processing, hosting and related activities\u201d.\nSince Sartorius did not recognize any capital expenditures and only immaterial operating expenditures related\nto fossil gas in fiscal 2022 for the economic activities described in EU Commission Delegated Regulation\n2022/1214 and in Annex XII, the reporting pursuant to Annex XII of EU Commission Delegated Regulation\n2021/2178 does not apply.\nProcedure for Determining Taxonomy Alignment (\u201cCompliance Assessment\u201d)\nSartorius used a three-step process to determine which turnover, capital expenditures, and operating\nexpenditures were taxonomy-aligned:\n\uf0a7 Determination of Basically Taxonomy-Eligible Economic Activities: The process of\ndetermining the Group\u2019s economic activities that are basically taxonomy-eligible was carried out\nseparately for the breakdown of turnover as well as capital expenditures and operating\nexpenditures. The results are each described in the following sections on taxonomy-aligned\nturnover, capital expenditures, and operating expenditures, respectively.\n\uf0a7 Assessment of Compliance with the Technical Screening Criteria: Compliance with the\ntechnical screening criteria, which include assessing whether the contribution to an EU\nenvironmental objective is substantial (\u201cSubstantial contribution\u201d \u2013 SC) and whether the other EU\nenvironmental objectives are not significantly harmed (\u201cDo no significant harm\u201d \u2013 DNSH), was\ndetermined by means of a survey of the relevant Group companies. The results are described in\neach of the following sections. With respect to the EU environmental objective \u201cadaptation to\nclimate change\u201d, the company\u2019s economic activities were generally not found to make a\nsignificant contribution.\n\uf0a7 Assessment of Compliance with the Minimum Safeguards: Sartorius assessed and determined\ncompliance with the minimum safeguards criteria based on the recommendations contained in\nthe Final Report on Minimum Safeguards published by the European Platform on Sustainable\nFinance in October 2022 for the following four topics as follows:\nTaxes: In this regard, the Group particularly refers to the existing Group-wide risk management\nsystem, which is described in the \u201cRisk and Opportunities\u201d section of this Annual Report starting\non page 70 et seq. Responsibility for tax compliance generally lies with the local management of\nthe individual Group companies. These are supported by both local tax consulting firms and the\ncentral Group Tax Department. A system of various measures, such as monitoring local\nregulations (filing deadlines, tax rates, etc.) and tax risks, ensures that information is collected\nwithin the Group and reported to the Executive Board accordingly.\nCorruption and Bribery: In this regard, the Group to refers to the existing Group-wide\ncompliance management system, which is described in the \u201cCorporate Governance Report\u201d\nsection of this Annual Report starting on page 102 et seq.\nStart Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Non-financial Group Statement 124\nFair Competition: In this regard, the Group would like to refer to the existing Group-wide\ncompliance management system, which is described in the \u201cCorporate Governance Report\u201d\nsection of this Annual Report starting on page 101 et seq.\nHuman Rights: With respect to the required human rights due diligence system in accordance\nwith the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for\nMultinational Enterprises, the Group refers to the existing measures for its own sites and direct\nand indirect suppliers described in this Non-financial Statement, which can be found in the\n\u201cSocial Responsibility\u201d and \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain\u201d sections, respectively. Sartorius\u2019\nhuman rights due diligence system does not extend to customer relationships, as the Group has\nnot identified any relevant areas of risk stemming from Sartorius\u2019 products and services. Since\nthe taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures and operating expenditures reported below for\nfiscal 2022 relate to Germany, Sartorius has assessed and determined the effectiveness of the\nsystem exclusively within this framework.\nAvoiding Double Counting\nSartorius currently allocates the amounts listed below exclusively to the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation. Furthermore, the individual economic activities reported for capital expenditures and\noperating expenditures are not interrelated. This approach eliminates double counting.\nStart"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

This analysis focuses on Sartorius's mechanisms for preventing, identifying, and responding to corruption and bribery occurrences, the independence of its investigation procedures, and the extent and efficacy of its training programs, all of which are in accordance with G1-3 regulations.\nSartorius has implemented a  compliance management system targeted to preventing and detecting corruption and bribery cases. Sartorius has implemented a global Code of Conduct and an Anti-Corruption Code to enhance its compliance management system and are published by the company regularly. \n   - The company's internal control system (ICS) is intended to ensure compliance with legal regulations and internal rules, and it contains both process-integrated and non-process-integrated monitoring tools.\n   - The ICS includes concepts, procedures, and mechanisms to ensure that accounting is accurate and in accordance with applicable legal provisions. This approach includes organizational measures such as function segregation and dual-review principles, as well as IT access limitations.\n   - Continuous coordination of internal and external accounting processes to perform reliable audits. The system also contains regular updates and communications about local and worldwide operating procedures.\n\n   - Sartorius' sustainability obligations are specified in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, which applies to all suppliers. The code includes protections for human rights, anti-corruption measures, and other compliance requirements. In order to continue doing business with Sartorius, suppliers must sign this code.\n\n   - Sartorius established an internal method for anonymously reporting suspicious instances including potential compliance breaches.\n\nSeveral procedures are taken to ensure the independence of Sartorius' inquiry processes.\n   - Sartorius AG's Audit Committee contributes to the internal control system through non-process-integrated audit operations. The committee evaluates quarterly and annual the financial statements and ensures that compliance investigations are independent of the line of management included. Compliance issues are discussed among Executive and Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees compliance and reports results . The internal reporting system for compliance infractions adheres to stringent confidentiality and non-retaliation policies, encouraging staff to report misconduct without fear of retribution.\nSartorius' anti-corruption and anti-bribery training programs are thorough and address a wide range of compliance issues.\n\n   - In fiscal year 2022, a sizable proportion of Sartorius employees (75.6%) received Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Code training. These training classes are intended to ensure that staff understand and follow Sartorius' compliance obligations.\n   - The training programs cover a wide range of issues, including conflicts of interest, customer commitment governance, and compliant partner involvement. The completion rates demonstrate a high degree of staff involvement and awareness of compliance problems.\n   - Sartorius ensures that high-risk functions receive proper compliance training. The company's compliance management strategy comprises targeted training and awareness-raising actions to prevent wrongdoing and financial loss.\n   - The success of these training programs is evidenced by the high completion rates and the inclusion of specific compliance themes relevant to different functions inside the firm.\n\n\nSartorius AG's ESG report demonstrates a complete and effective approach to avoiding, detecting, and combating corruption and bribery. The organization has effective systems and rules in place, as well as clear communication methods, independent investigative procedures, and significant training programs. \n\nThe ESG report meets G1-3 regulatory criteria, confirming Sartorius' dedication to ethical behavior and compliance. However, ongoing transparency and regular updates on the effectiveness of these efforts will be required to ensure regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust. Based on the available information, there are no substantial gaps in detail or execution."}]}

Our efforts here are in line with SDG 17, which calls for a revitalized, strengthened global partnership that brings together governments, civil soci- ety, the private sector, the United Nations, and other entities.\nOnly by collaborating closely with stakeholder groups can we make serious progress on complex and intertwined sustainability challenges such as environmental concerns. We maintain a con- stant dialog for that purpose with investors, customers, suppliers, our people, communities, policymakers, media, nongovern- mental organizations, business organizations, and academia. Our management and the relevant specific units with gover- nance functions are in charge of this task. For example, overall responsibility for dialog with policymakers lies with the Siemens Managing Board. Within the various business units, the unit\u2019s CEO is responsible for coordinated dialog. The Managing Board has tasked the Government Affairs Department with performing the necessary coordination duties and has given it the powers it needs for the purpose.\nThis engagement with our stakeholder groups creates value on all sides of the equation through exchanges of knowledge and information, as well as through creative partnerships. It helps us improve business conditions and reduce both external and internal risks. Our new DEGREE sustainability framework is also founded on dialog with our customers, investors, suppliers, and our people, and with society at large, and on acknowledging the impact our business has on the planet. This new framework thus represents a 360-degree stakeholder approach.\nIn dialog with politics and society\nAs a global company, we work with our customers to find inno- vative solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing the planet. For that reason, dialog with policymakers is intrinsic to our social responsibility and is of tremendous importance to our success as a company. We base the priorities of our political activities on our business strategies and innovation fields.\nOur advocacy activities focus on the following topics and policy areas, among others: cybersecurity, digitalization (including Internet of Things / IoT and artificial intelligence / AI), decarbon- ization and climate change action, energy, R&D, and trade policy, as well as connected and automated mobility for rail and road. We have joined forces with leading companies from around the world to establish the Charter of Trust, which aims to make the digital world safer and more secure.\nWWW.CHARTEROFTRUST.COM\nSIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 36\n\n2.3 Partnerships and collaborations for sustainability\nFurthermore, we support the goal of achieving a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050 \u2013 announced as part of the European Green Deal \u2013 through a variety of commitments, including our active memberships in the European Alliance to Save Energy ( HTTPS://EUASE.NET) and the EUROPEAN GREEN DIGITAL COALITION.\nAs part of the European Green Deal, \u201cfit for 55\u201d is an important \u2013 and tangible \u2013 step toward the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 55% until 2030 and achieving complete climate neutrality by 2050. The proposed measures establish conditions under which companies can now make long-term plans. A fair and reasonable carbon price will accelerate the embrace of low-carbon technol- ogies, and should thus extend to as many sectors as possible so as to encourage the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Siemens will continue to do its part here \u2013 because we have the necessary technologies and knowledge to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and to conserve resources.\nOur political involvement is guided by firm principles. We are politically neutral and take a zero-tolerance approach to corrup- tion, violations of fair competition principles, and other breach- es of applicable law and internal regulations. Siemens does not make political donations and contributions (donations to politi- cians, political parties, or political organizations). All contribu- tions that support purely political purposes or the representation of political interests, such as election events for political cam- paigns, are prohibited by our internal guidelines.\nEngagement in associations and organizations\nIn addition, Siemens is a member of numerous business associ- ations and similar organizations, some of which advocate for their members\u2019 interests in the political arena. Selected examples of the most important memberships in our three core markets (the European Union, the United States of America, and China) are: the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the VDMA\n(Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau e.V.), the Ger- man Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ZVEI), the European Round Table for Industry (ERT), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the European Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC). More information on political activities at Siemens can be found here: HTTPS://NEW.SIEMENS.COM/GLOBAL/EN/COMPANY/ ABOUT/CORPORATE-FUNCTIONS/GOVERNMENT-AFFAIRS.HTML\nWe also work closely with the Organization for Economic Coop- eration and Development (OECD), the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Economic Forum (WEF). We are involved in various initiatives of the WEF, such as the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and the WEF CEO Climate Leaders Coalition.\nWe cooperate as well with the United Nations, for instance as part of our commitment to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). When it comes to environmental issues, we support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the UN climate conferences and we are actively involved in the CEO Water Mandate. Further- more, we have joined the World Bank\u2019s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC), and we advocate for the global introduction of carbon pricing. We are additionally committed to the UNGC Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles and have signed the Diversity Charter, an initiative by the German government.\nFor years, we have supported One Young World (OYW), a non-profit organization that champions young business leaders around the globe in order to build a better world with more responsible, more effective leadership. At the 2021 OYW Summit in Munich, we celebrated ten years of our CEO\u2019s\u2019 involvement with the organization and we supported this event again in 2022, when it was held in Manchester, by sending more than 40 of our colleagues to attend.\nSIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 37\nThe image depicts the Siemens compliance system, which is structured around three key management responsibilities: Prevent, Detect, and Respond. These responsibilities are illustrated in a circular flow to emphasize their continuous and interconnected nature.\n\nBelow the circular flow, the image highlights several key activity fields of the compliance system, each represented by an icon and a label:\n\n1. **Anti-Corruption**: Represented by an icon showing a hand giving money.\n2. **Anti-Money Laundering**: Illustrated by an icon of a washing machine with money being crossed out.\n3. **Antitrust**: Depicted with an icon showing figures in a competitive situation.\n4. **Collective Action**: Represented by puzzle pieces fitting together.\n5. **Data Privacy**: Illustrated with an icon of a folder with a padlock.\n6. **Export Control**: Shown with a globe and interconnected arrows.\n7. **Human Rights**: Depicted by an icon of an open hand.\n\nThe overall design underscores the importance of these activity fields in maintaining a robust compliance system within Siemens.\n\n2.4 Sustainability ratings reflect our performance\n2.4\nSustainability ratings reflect our performance\n \u2013 Our engagement is recognized in a number of ratings and rankings\n\u2013 This helps continuously improve our sustainability performance\n\u2013 It also strengthens the Siemens brand and enhances the satisfaction of our people\nOur commitment to sustainability is widely recognized in a variety of significant ratings and rankings. This recognition corroborates the wisdom of our sustainability strategy, and at the same time it also provides us with a yardstick for continuous improvement.\nWe actively involve ourselves with external ratings and rankings as a way of measuring our performance against similar companies and competitors. There are four reasons why this engagement is important to us:\n1. Markets and customers increasingly want information about ratings and rankings and they have begun to require these assessments as part of their contract terms.\n2. Investors are increasingly developing their own ratings and rankings to assess companies\u2019 sustainability performance.\n3. We want to be able to measure our performance against that of peers and competitors so that we can initiate the right steps for improvement and detect important trends in sustainability.\n4.

We operate on the premise that only clean business is Siemens business. If violations do occur, we respond consistently and vigorously following defined procedures, every- where in the world and on all organizational levels.\nWe are also convinced that responsible business practices, in addition to compliance with laws and regulations, require that we act on the basis of ethical principles. Siemens has enshrined its ethical principles in its BCGs, which all employees are bound to follow. Our aspiration is to support the sustainable develop- ment of Siemens and the societies in which we operate by ad- hering to responsible business practices. We have also enshrined this approach in our DEGREE Framework under the letter \u201cE\u201d for\nEthics. STRATEGY SIEMENS AT A GLANCE\nOur compliance organization contributes in particular to the achievement of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16, \u201cPeace, Justice and Strong Institutions.\u201d That goal includes a call for companies to dramatically reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.\nWorldwide commitment to fighting corruption\nBeyond our company\u2019s borders and in collaboration with other international and national organizations we are committed to fighting corruption and promoting fair competition in our mar- kets. This is also reflected in our Collective Action activities. Part of that engagement is our commitment to the United Nations\n\u201cWe help our customers and\npartners around the world drive\ntheir digital and sustainable\ntransformation. Without excuses\nor exceptions, we always act\nethically, legally, and with the\nhighest integrity.\u201d\nCEO Roland Busch\nGlobal Compact (UNGC) and our involvement in the World Eco- nomic Forum and its Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI). In addition, we actively support the United Nations Con- vention against Corruption and the Anti-Bribery Convention of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For years, we have been supporting the implementation of these Conventions as part of Business 20 (B20).\nThe Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guide- lines for Multinational Enterprises, and other guidelines are a foundation for our companywide work in this domain and are also enshrined in our code of conduct, the Siemens BCGs, that provide direction for all our activities. BUSINESS CONDUCT GUIDELINES\nSiemens and its roughly 311,000 employees operate in many different countries throughout the world with customers in both the private and public sectors that serve a vast array of industrial sectors. Our global business operations are governed by numer- ous national legal systems and a variety of political, social, and cultural settings, which are constantly changing. Accordingly, the environment where Siemens conducts its business, and thereby carries out its compliance activities, is correspondingly complex.\n\n\n         3.1 Compliance and Ethics\nThe Siemens compliance system\nOur BCGs contain the fundamental principles and rules for our conduct, both within Siemens and in our relationships with our customers, external partners, and the general public. They also serve as an expression of our values and lay the basis for detailed internal regulations. The BCGs are binding for all Siemens em- ployees around the world.\nThe goal of compliance at Siemens is to ensure that our business practices worldwide comply with the BCGs and follow applicable laws. The areas of activity of our compliance organization in- clude:\nSiemens maintains a comprehensive compliance system based on the three pillars of prevention, detection, and response to ensure compliance within the company.\nPreventive measures include compliance risk management, the preparation of topic-specific guidelines and procedures, the in- corporation of compliance requirements into our business pro- cesses, and the provision of comprehensive training and advice to our people. Channels for reporting compliance violations \u2013 such as the \u201cTell Us\u201d whistleblower system and the Ombudsper- son as well as professional and fair investigations \u2013 are indispens- able for recognizing and completely resolving matters of misconduct. Unambiguous responses and clear consequences serve to punish misconduct and eliminate weaknesses. To ensure that our compliance system is put into action and meets our requirements everywhere in the world, our internal audit depart- ment continuously performs compliance controls and audits.\nOne of the key components of this compliance system is the responsibility of our management. That is why the global Legal and Compliance department is directly assigned to the Chairman\n\u2192 Anti-corruption,\n\u2192 Anti-money laundering, \u2192 Antitrust,\n\u2192 Data privacy,\n\u2192 Export control,\n\u2192 Collective Action,\n\u2192 Human rights.\nHUMAN RIGHTS\nCYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nSiemens compliance system\nKorruptionsbek\u00e4mpfung Anti-Corruption\nGeldw\u00e4schepr\u00e4vention Anti-Money Laundering\nKartellrecht Antitrust\nDatenschutz Data Privacy\nMenschenrechte Human Rights\n\nVerantwortung des Management Managements responsibility\nCollective Action Collective Action\nExportkontrolle Export Control\n\n3.1 Compliance and Ethics\nof the Managing Board as a governance function. Our Chief Com- pliance Officer delivers quarterly reports directly to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board of Siemens AG.\nThe global structure of the compliance organization combines strong Group-level governance with the work of qualified com- pliance officers who ensure that the compliance system is im- plemented worldwide. They work closely with employees and managers, who assume personal responsibility for compliance within their respective business units.\nThe entire management team has to act on our commitment to compliance and ensure that all business decisions and transac- tions that fall within their area of responsibility comply with both the relevant legal requirements and our own values and compa- ny guidelines. Siemens managers demonstrate a strong commit- ment to compliance and ethical conduct.\nCompliance-related questions are included in the annual Siemens Global Employee Survey in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the compliance system within the company. We also use the survey to gain a better understanding of the degree to which ethical conduct is embedded in our corporate culture. The results of last year\u2019s survey show high approval rates relative to the per- ception and awareness of integrity, ethics, and responsible busi- ness conduct throughout the organization. The next survey is scheduled for fiscal 2023.\nEthics management at Siemens\nSiemens is committed to responsible and ethical business con- duct. To this end, the Management Board mandated the compli- ance organization to further strengthen ethics management at Siemens this year.\nBased on the values enshrined in the BCGs, with ethics manage- ment, we have created a framework to anchor ethics in our cor- porate culture on a long-term basis. The compliance organization empowers and helps all employees to understand the ethical principles of Siemens and to incorporate ethical considerations into their daily decisions and actions.\nThe compliance organization develops and implements ethics management in cross-functional networks.\nCompliance risk management\nTo be effective, the Siemens compliance system needs to be continuously adjusted in order to meet business-specific risks and multiple local legal requirements. The findings from compli- ance risk assessments, as well as compliance controls and audits, serve as a basis for deriving measures to further develop the compliance system.\nThe goal of compliance risk management is to detect compliance risks at an early stage and take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate risks. Risk assessments are also integrated into individ- ual business processes and tools that evaluate risks in any given business decisions and take appropriate risk mitigation steps. Thus, compliance can make a decisive contribution to achieving our corporate goals.\nCompliance risk management is an integral part of the company- wide Siemens Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program SIEMENS FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL 2022, COMBINED MANAGEMENT- REPORT, 8.3.1 STRATEGIC RISKS, which creates a holistic view of all identified risks throughout the Group. Each entity and each re- gion assess its business risks in relation to compliance risks.\nCurrent developments are also systematically evaluated.\nIn close collaboration with the relevant business units, the early identification and assessment of the compliance risks involved in new digital business models are a core part of our risk man- agement process.\nAdditional information from internal data sources is included in order to provide a holistic overview of compliance risks. Cross-functional exchange at regular meetings and an annual Corporate Compliance Risk Workshop also make it possible to identify and monitor emerging or changing risks. The results of the risk assessment are therefore a key starting point for the ongoing development of our compliance system.\n\nCompliance priorities in fiscal 2022\nOur compliance priorities are the foundation for the continuous development and improvement of our system. We keep a close watch on the ever-evolving requirements in the compliance en- vironment and strive to fulfill them. Among the challenges in this regard are changes in market conditions and in the compli- ance risks of our business activities.\nOur long-term compliance priorities are constantly evolving, so we can work from a reliable perspective when pursuing our com- pliance activities. These priorities are supplemented by focus areas and specific activities for each fiscal year, and they contin- ued to guide our work in fiscal 2022. All compliance employees are actively encouraged and committed to the fulfillment of our priorities.\nCompliance training\nTo ensure that compliance and integrity are deeply anchored in the organization, both Siemens employees and the Compliance Department receive targeted, group-oriented, risk-based training on compliance topics.\nCompliance training for the Siemens organization emphasizes three core aims:\n1. To impart values and raise awareness of fundamental com- pliance issues among all employees.\n2. To convey in-depth specialized knowledge to managers and specific target groups.\n3. To provide additional materials on all relevant compliance topics for all employees.\nCompliance priorities\nCommunication\n\nn\nEthics management\nFurther develop and introduce the elements of the Ethics Management initiative as an integral part of our Corporate culture and processes \u2013 building on DEGREE, the Siemens BCGs, and our Compliance Management System\nStrategic advice\nAdvice on new business models and go-to-market strategies. Provide assurance in rapidly changing external regulatory environment\nPeople development\nBuild growth mindset and upskill our organization through learning and development initiatives. Foster enhanced collaboration with global networks\nSimplification and digitalization\nKeep Pace with Digital Transformation through dedicated tech transformation initiatives\nand the continued risk-based streamlining of processes\nSIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 43\n\n3.1 Compliance and Ethics\nEmployees learn about the compliance activity fields through programs such as mandatory web-based training courses on the contents of our BCGs. In addition, there are also additional train- ing materials that can be used for specific target groups; these are available on the global learning platform.\nThe BCG training was rolled out to around 106,000 employees worldwide, and 102,000 of them (approximately 96%) success- fully completed the training by the end of fiscal 2022.1\n102,000 employees were trained on the contents of our Business Conduct Guidelines in fiscal 2022\nIn addition, Siemens employees around the world completed about 409,000 training programs for specific target groups in fiscal 2022.1\nTraining on Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines\nEmployees who previously could not be included in Siemens internal IT system for training received in-person training in 2022. Face-to-face training sessions were held at every produc- tion site worldwide. By these means, we ensure that every employ- ee receives training within the recurring three-year cycle, in keeping with the DEGREE target. The new three-year cycle will begin in fiscal 2023 with a new BCG web-based training course for all employees.\nIn addition, materials are regularly made available for the so-called Integrity Dialogs. In this initiative, managers have an opportunity to discuss current compliance issues with their teams as well as to specifically communicate and provide information about selected compliance topics.\nAdditional learning measures are planned and initiated according to regional conditions. A learning management system helps track mandatory training courses. The completion of training requirements is regularly reported to the management of the respective unit.\nCollaboration with business partners\nUnder certain circumstances, Siemens can be held liable for the illegal activities of certain third parties (such as business partners acting as intermediaries, resellers, and consortium partners), whom we refer to as business partners. That is because transac- tions with Siemens could be misused to gain undue advantages for the business partner, or for Siemens.\nEach Siemens unit is responsible for its own business partners. They must be carefully selected by the responsible operational unit and must undergo a risk-based compliance due diligence process. Business partners need to be adequately monitored for the duration of the business relationship; in other words, the need for the relationship and performance, taking into account remuneration and other accompanying circumstances, is regu- larly reassessed. We have established mandatory processes and related tools for this purpose that are continuously refined to cover risks that arise.\n     E Ethics\nProgress DEGREE Ethics #3: Striving to train 100% of our people on Siemens\u2019 Business Conduct Guidelines every three years\nAs part of the DEGREE Framework, Siemens has set itself the goal of training all employees on the subject of the BCGs in a three-year cycle. The first cycle, in which 99.9% of employees worldwide were trained on the BCGs, covered the years 2020 to 2022. Thus, the DEGREE target for Ethics was nearly achieved.\nProgress\nFrom FY 20 99.9% 100% by 2022 Siemens without SHS\n 1 This figure includes Siemens Healthineers employees. SIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 44\n\n 3.1 Compliance and Ethics\nDecisions about engaging a business partner are transparent and risk-oriented, and are based on the most recent compliance due diligence procedures. Appropriate remediation measures are initiated depending on the risk classification of the business relationship and the risks identified.\nBoth business partners and suppliers are required to sign a code of conduct. In addition, depending on the risk classification, audits can be carried out at the business partners\u2019 premises by the Siemens audit function or external service providers.\nSUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES\nTo support the compliance experts regarding business partner topics, Siemens established the Business Partners Network two years ago. This network operates in different workstreams, some of which related to specific projects and others related to specific questions on the subject of collaboration with business partners.\nEarly detection of warning signs of money laundering\nSiemens has a declared goal of doing business only with reliable customers, business partners, and other third parties. That\u2019s why we perform risk-based checks of our business counterparts\u2019 iden- tity and financial backgrounds as well as the origin of their pay- ments in order to ensure that payments come from legitimate sources. Where necessary, Siemens reports suspicious matters to the responsible authorities.\nA new anti-money laundering training course is planned for the coming fiscal year. Certain groups of employees who typically encounter issues related to anti-money laundering laws will receive intensive training on the subject of potential anti-money laundering red flags.\nCompany-wide process for the handling of compliance cases (simplified presentation)\nThe goal is to ensure that employees can identify signs of money laundering or terrorist financing at the earliest possible stage and when necessary initiate mitigation measures, in cooperation with the Compliance Department, to reduce the risk to the company.\nHandling of compliance cases\nAt Siemens, compliance cases are handled in accordance with a clearly structured process comprising all steps from reporting channels to internal investigations and responses to identified violations (see the diagram below).\nSiemens makes different reporting channels available to all em- ployees and outside third parties to ensure that the company is made aware of any compliance violations. For example, com- plaints can be reported by way of the protected whistleblower system \u201cTell Us\u201d or to the independent Siemens ombudsperson. Reports received by way of these channels are forwarded to our compliance organization. Complaints can also be reported directly to the Compliance Officers in our business units or to the senior management.\nEvery complaint is taken seriously. If the allegations prove to be sufficiently plausible, the Compliance organization determines whether there is sufficient information to justify an internal investigation. Indications of other matters are forwarded to the affected Siemens department or business unit for further action.\n              Allegation received\n\n3.1 Compliance and Ethics\nThroughout the company, internal investigations are conducted on the basis of binding, clearly defined standards to ensure the fair and respectful treatment of employees. These standards prohibit unlawful or disproportionate actions. If an internal investigation leads to the finding that employees have demon- strably violated any laws or internal regulations, they can expect appropriate disciplinary consequences.\nAll circumstances of a given case, including the locally applicable legal environment, and any participation rights of the competent employee representative bodies are duly considered in the course of the proceedings.\nThe affected Siemens entities are obligated to implement the additional recommendations included in the investigation re- ports, including measures to rectify any deficiencies, in order to effectively remedy the situation.\nWhistleblowers at Siemens are protected by internal regulations that prohibit the punishment or other detrimental treatment of whistleblowers who report suspicious activity in good faith.\nCompliance indicators and whistleblowers\nOur employees make regular use of our reporting channels. In total, 363 compliance cases requiring additional inquiry or inves- tigations were reported in fiscal 2022. We believe that the decrease in compliance cases from the previous year falls within the range of normal fluctuation. The total number of disciplinary measures imposed for compliance violations was 212 in fiscal 2022.\nThe number of disciplinary measures in a fiscal year does not necessarily reflect the number of compliance cases reported in the same period. Frequently, disciplinary action is not taken in the year in which the underlying cases were reported or the in- vestigation \u2013 which follows a careful procedure \u2013 was completed. A compliance case may also result in multiple disciplinary actions or none at all.\n\nContinuing and discontinued operations\nIncludes loss of variable and voluntary compensation components, transfer, and suspension\nWe believe that the evidence demonstrates that our compliance system is well designed and effectively implemented. Due to the nature of our business operations, the environments where we work, and geographic breadth, we do not regard the number of incidents as unusual.\nMore information on significant ongoing and future charges of corruption, antitrust violations, and other violations of the law can be found in SIEMENS FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL 2022, COM- BINED MANAGEMENT REPORT, CHAPTER 8.3.4 COMPLIANCE RISK AND NOTES 22 LITIGATIONS\nCollective Action and\nthe Siemens Integrity Initiative\nIf substantial progress is to be made in combating corruption and fostering fair competition, large numbers of stakeholders must act collectively. The global Siemens Integrity Initiative earmarks more than US$100 million to support organizations and projects that combat corruption and fraud through Collective Action, education, and training. The Siemens Integrity Initiative focuses on supporting projects that have a clear impact on the business environment, can demonstrate objective and measurable results, and have the potential to be scaled up and replicated.\nBuilding upon the Third Funding Round, we invited short-listed partners to submit applications for additional support, adhering to the published criteria for application and selection. A team of experts from various disciplines and regions carefully reviewed the projects, presented them to the Siemens Steering Committee for approval, and then introduced them to the World Bank for what is known as the \u201cnon-veto\u201d process and to the European Investment Bank for information.\n\n3.1 Compliance and Ethics\nIn July 2021, we announced a total of up to US$20.5 million in funding for eight new projects with activities over three years in more than 27 countries.\nSo far we have allocated approximately US$120 million for 85 projects in more than 50 countries across all funding rounds. Detailed information on this subject is provided in the annual reports of the Siemens Integrity Initiative.\nWWW.SIEMENS.COM/INTEGRITY-INITIATIVE\nUS$120 million support for 85 projects in 50 countries\nThe Siemens Integrity Initiative constitutes one element of a 2009 settlement between Siemens and the World Bank and an- other 2013 settlement between Siemens and the European In- vestment Bank (EIB).\nResults and progress in fiscal 2022\nIn fiscal 2022, we again made significant progress with our Siemens compliance system, including:\n\u2192 The new compliance pact for our Mobility high-speed rail project was presented as a prime example of the practical implementation of Collective Action at the Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention Against Corruption, which was held in Egypt. The compliance pact is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure compliance with anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and antitrust laws.\n\u2192 As part of our continuous improvement measures at Com- pliance, we have enhanced our integrated risk management approach to include a continuous monitoring and update concept that enables us to more quickly adapt to factors such as emerging risks, business transformation, and changing regulatory and geopolitical conditions.\nOutlook for fiscal 2023\nOur paramount goal is to provide Siemens with the highest level of certainty in matters of compliance and to promote a market environment of integrity.\nWe will continue our development of a compliance system tai- lored to the individual risks and opportunities of our businesses and our organizational structure at Siemens.\nTo keep pace with the digital transformation of our company, we are transforming and modernizing the technology that supports our compliance management system. With the new cloud-based solutions, we will further streamline and automate our risk-based compliance processes and leverage for data-driven holistic risk management and continuous control activities.\nWe will also continue to implement the projects of the Siemens Integrity Initiative and monitor their progress.\nWWW.SIEMENS.COM/INTEGRITY-INITIATIVE\nFinally, we will communicate our ethical principles more inten- sively and embed them in training courses and internal process- es in the current fiscal year.\n\u201cEthical corporate governance and\ncompliance are non-negotiable. Our\napproach goes beyond strict\ncompliance with laws and\nregulations by placing integrity at\nthe center of our corporate culture\nand business processes.\u201d\nCEO Roland Busch\nIn the Siemens Global Employee Survey to be conducted in fiscal 2023, we will again elicit feedback from our employees on the subject of integrity and ethics at Siemens and formulate appro- priate measures on the basis of their responses.\n SIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 47\n\n 3.2 Human rights\n3.2\nHuman rights\n\u2013 Respect for human rights remains in focus at all times \u2013 Commitment to compliance with international standards \u2013 Inclusion of all key partners\nAs a global company, we are well aware of our responsibility to society. We are unreservedly committed to safeguarding and respecting human rights in every stage of the value chain. We understand this to be a key element of acting with integrity and responsible corporate governance. Our holistic approach to respecting human rights is not limited to our own business loca- tions: We also consider our supply chain and the business activ- ities of our customers. Our goal and aspiration is to identify any human rights violations occurring anywhere in our value chain as early as possible and to mitigate identified risks responsibly.\nOur DEGREE framework consists of different components to ad- dress the multifaceted issue of human rights in the areas of G (Governance), E (Ethics), and E (Equity). In the following, the human rights-related topics in the DEGREE framework are outlined.\nCommitment to human rights and international standards\nThe principle of respect for human rights is firmly grounded in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Siemens believes that the corresponding Sustainability Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) can only be fully achieved if any potentially negative impacts within the value chains are examined in great- er detail and effective action is taken to counter them. In these efforts, we are guided by international standards that help com- panies define their approaches to human rights and continuously optimize them. These standards include the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Guide- lines for Multinational Enterprises published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). They high- light the importance of a due diligence process that is able to proactively identify, assess, and prevent any human rights viola-\ntions to protect those affected or at least mitigate their impacts as much as possible.\nThe Business Conduct Guidelines\nOur pledge to safeguard human rights is anchored in our Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs) COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS. They set out the fundamental principles and rules that apply to our actions within our company and in relation to our customers, external partners, and the public. The BCGs are binding on all employees worldwide. In addition, the Siemens Group Code of Conduct, which is mainly focused on rules of conduct in relation to human rights, applies to the company\u2019s suppliers, third-party intermediaries, and business partners.\nBeyond that, Siemens AG reaffirmed its commitment to workers\u2019 fundamental rights in an International Framework Agreement signed with trade unions and employee representatives in 2012.\nManagement and responsibilities\nOur actions in support of respect for human rights and our com- mitment to implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are monitored by the Siemens Managing Board and the Siemens Sustainability Board (SSB). These bodies discuss both progress and challenges and identify improvement measures. Furthermore, the Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Supervisory Board and Managing Board at a regular and also on an ad hoc basis on topics relating to human rights.\nThe SSB has assigned overall responsibility for human rights to the Sustainability and Compliance departments, which are charged with the task of proactively and systematically ensuring that respect for human rights is more deeply embedded in the company\u2019s worldwide processes and business decisions. To this end, the two departments continually identify and address improvement potential on the basis of the major principles of business conduct and human rights set out in the UN Global Compact. The departments Supply Chain, People and Organiza-\nSIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 48\n\n3.2 Human rights\ntion, Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Security, and Siemens Real Estate are responsible for embedding and main- taining human rights-related due diligence obligations within their business processes. This responsibility also includes func- tionally relevant training and continuing education.\nHUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AT SIEMENS\nContinuous improvement measures\nWe view living up to our responsibility for human rights as a continuous improvement process. Siemens employs risk man- agement programs and procedures across its value chain to systematically identify and assess risks of human rights violations at an early stage and mitigate these risks to the extent that they\ncan be influenced by the company. After the rollout of our new due diligence approach in the area of human rights, we focused on target group-appropriate competence development and the incorporation of this approach into the risk management pro- cesses of the individual business units in fiscal 2022.\nHuman rights in the supply chain\nMaintaining sustainable supply chains is one of our guiding prin- ciples. Siemens suppliers commit to uphold the Siemens Group Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries and Business Partners, which affirms the fundamental human rights of our suppliers\u2019 employees.\n Siemens\u2019 human rights framework\n I.

This includes Corporate Responsibility Self- Assessments (CRSAs) by suppliers, internal quality audits with sustainability questions, and external sustainability audits. Whenever deviations are identified from the principles of the Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers, and therefore also violations of the human rights principles defined in this docu- ment, we work with the supplier to clarify how lasting corrective action can be taken within a reasonable time frame.\nSUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES\nIn case of severe violations, we reserve the right to terminate the supplier relationship. MATERIAL HUMAN RIGHTS RISK ISSUES WITHIN OUR VALUE CHAIN\nWith regard to the new German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), which is applicable to Siemens as of January 1, 2023, we have established a cross-functional working group to evaluate the effects of the new law on Siemens and meet any new requirements in a timely manner.\nHuman rights in the workplace\nThe BCGs BUSINESS CONDUCT GUIDELINES are an integral element of all employment contracts. Every employee is responsible for respecting human rights. Siemens does not tolerate discrimina- tion, sexual harassment, or any other form of personal attack on individuals or groups. In addition, the principles of equal oppor- tunity and equal treatment apply without restriction. We promote diversity in line with our strategic DEGREE Framework aspirations of Equity and Ethics. We have set ourselves the goal of having 30% of the company\u2019s senior management positions held by women by the year 2025. Another goal is for 100% of our employees to receive training on the subject of our BCGs. We champion diversity, equal opportunity, and inclusion in the in- terest of creating an open and appreciative work environment\nfor our people. We acknowledge that we must ourselves effect the transformation we want and remain committed to creating a more equitable, more sustainable future.\nSiemens launched the internal initiative \u201cTogether We Rise\u201d in January 2022 to promote diversity and women\u2019s rights in the workplace. The goal is for women to work on issues of common interest and support each other through networking, coaching, and mentoring. Around 250 female employees from Middle Eastern countries like Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are taking part in this initiative.\nIn fiscal 2022, moreover, Siemens India conducted an impact assessment of human rights-related risk categories at roughly 20 Siemens locations in India, with a particular emphasis on risk areas such as discrimination and working conditions. The find- ings will be evaluated in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and will serve both as the basis for the development of targeted measures to mitigate or preferably prevent the identified risks in the future and to fulfill the reporting requirements following the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)\nFair pay, right to collective bargaining, and freedom of association\nThe principles of fair pay, right to collective bargaining, and free- dom of association are embedded in the Siemens BCGs and in the International Framework Agreement COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS. Fair pay is an integral aspect of appreciative and respectful rela- tions with employees. In line with national laws and regulations, Siemens is guided by the principle of \u201cequal pay for equal work\u201d. In Germany, for example, the pay system according to the col- lective bargaining agreements is determined in the course of collective bargaining negotiations. 78% of employees in Germany are covered by collective agreements.\nAdditional information can be found in the Chapters WORKING AT SIEMENS and DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION\nHuman rights in customer related business decision\nSiemens is committed to operationalize systematic human rights due diligence along its value chain. This is also applicable for customer related business decision.\nSIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 50\n\n3.2 Human rights\nThe global web-based training program for environmental, social, and human rights due diligence was continued in fiscal 2022. Although the training program is available to all employees, participation is obligatory for a defined target group consisting of senior managers, salespeople, and risk management profes- sionals. Additionally to the 31,000 employees who have per- formed the training in fiscal year 2021, another 6,546 employees completed the training in fiscal year 2022.\nA survey of required training fields was conducted in fiscal 2022 with the aim of promoting competence development. The target group participating in the survey was composed of the Sustain- ability Managers and ESG Managers at business level as well as Sustainability Managers in key functions. The majority of respon- dents stated that additional support is needed in the fields of \u201centrepreneurial responsibility in conflict regions\u201d and \u201chigh-risk sectors.\u201d Target group-appropriate training courses will be given on these subjects in the course of fiscal 2023 to ensure compe- tence development.\nSiemens also plans to hold moderated external and internal expert dialogs and regular knowledge sharing with internal experts in the area of environmental and social risks.\nGrievance mechanism and channels\nSiemens offers all our people and outside third parties protected channels for reporting violations of external and internal rules. The reports generated by these channels are forwarded to our Compliance organization and followed up. The same channels can also be used to report human rights violations to the company.\nCOMPLIANCE AND ETHICS\nIn September 2022, Siemens India issued a comprehensive guideline defining the grievance mechanism for permanent employees and temporary workers, after which the framework was developed in conjunction with a local benchmarking project. The framework defines employee grievances and assigns respon- sibilities in accordance with the reporting requirements of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR).\nWWW.SIEMENS.COM/HUMANRIGHTS\n1 econsense is a Forum for the Sustainable Development of German Business. SIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 52\nNetworks and coalitions\nA regular dialog with peer group companies creates a platform founded on mutual trust for a more in-depth discussion of human rights. This also helps us come up with fresh ideas and harness past experiences for continuous improvement measures within our company. This kind of mutual dialog focuses on discussing challenges and solutions, addressing conflicts of goals, and iden- tifying possible areas of shared action. After all, we firmly believe that we can achieve faster progress by concerted action than by acting alone.\nSiemens is a member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBI). This initiative is one of the leading international network initiatives in the area of human rights, consisting of more than 23 companies from all over the world. Siemens is also represented in the European Business and Human Rights Peer Learning Group of the UN Global Compact Network. In Germany, Siemens is involved in the working groups of econsense 1 in the areas of business and human rights and human rights in the supply chain.\nBesides regular dialog with peer groups and think tanks, we also interact continually with external human rights advisors on the subject of training, sensitization, and due diligence. In addition, we communicate continually with investors, shareholders, rating agencies, and NGOs.\n Self-assessments completed mainly by suppliers from non-OECD countries with a purchasing volume of >\u20ac50,000 per year. Questionnaires that were initiatied, completed, and concluded in the reporting period.\n2 Commonwealth of Independent States.\n3 Improvement measures agreed upon with suppliers relate either to actual\ndeviations from the Code of Conduct or to structural improvements in management systems and the lack of specific processes and guidelines implemented by the supplier.\nQuality audits with sustainability questions\nThe quality audits of suppliers conducted by Siemens auditors include questions on the subject of sustainability that cover all aspects and requirements of the Code of Conduct. We conduct- ed 321 on-site audits worldwide in fiscal 2022. This equals the amount of the previous year almost exactly.\n1 Commonwealth of Independent States.\n2 Includes audits conducted virtually as well as audits carried out by third parties at\nour suppliers based on the same standards and are accepted by Siemens.\n3 Improvement measures agreed upon with suppliers relate either to actual\ndeviations from the Code of Conduct or to structural improvements in management systems and the lack of specific processes and guidelines implemented by the supplier.\nWe slightly increased the number of external sustainability audits compared to fiscal 2021: in 2022, the figure rose by about 8% to 426 audits. This figure includes 37 audits that we conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where the auditor in- spected the supplier\u2019s facility by a remote video link. It also in- cludes 12 audits verified by our auditor that were conducted on behalf of third parties at companies that are also in a supplier re- lationship with Siemens. These audit reports fully comply with Siemens requirements and were provided to us with the approval of the audited companies.\n       Supplier quality audits with integrated sustainability questions\n\n\n7.3 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nTogether with the bottom-up approach, these measures enable a comprehensive overview of our business activities and the related risks and opportunities.\nClimate change is not treated as a separate category within the ERM approach, but is considered within the four topic areas of strategic, operational, financial, and compliance-related risks. Risk processes have been implemented upstream throughout the company to assess potential climate-related net risks for ERM reporting.\nMaterial opportunities and risks are disclosed on an aggregated basis within the above-mentioned four topic areas in the Siemens annual report. SIEMENS FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL 2022, COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT, CHAPTER 8, CDP 2022 C2.1 AND C2.2\nMetrics and targets\nSiemens considers climate-related risks and opportunities along the entire value chain. Accordingly, we define metrics for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain, in the company\u2019s own operations, and for the goods and services we provide to our customers.\nIn 2015, Siemens made a pledge to achieve climate neutrality. We were the first global industrial company to take this step. By joining the Science Based Targets initiative and committing to decarbonization targets under the DEGREE framework, we have reinforced our existing decarbonization activities along the entire value chain. Our validated 1.5-degree Celsius Science Based Target, coupled with our membership of the RE100, EV100, and EP100 initiatives, is strengthening our climate protection strategy.\nBy joining the Science Based Targets initiative, Siemens has pledged to reduce emissions from its own operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 50% by 2030 and its Scope 3 emissions (upstream and downstream) by 15%, compared to 2019. A number of ongoing activities will contribute to this GHG reduction, including the reduction of building emissions, the electrification of the com- pany\u2019s motor vehicle fleet, and our Carbon Reduction @ Suppliers approach.\nAt Siemens, we bundle our binding targets and measures relating to climate protection under \u201cD\u201d (Decarbonization) in our DEGREE sustainability framework. For our KPI \u201cNet Zero operations by 2030,\u201d we have accelerated our reduction target for our business operations (Scopes 1 and 2) for Siemens without SHS to \u2013 55% by 2025 compared to 2019. By 2030, we aim to reduce emissions by 90% instead of 50% compared to 2019. As set out in the DEGREE framework, we also aim to reduce upstream supply chain emissions 20% by 2030 (compared to base year 2020) and then reduce them to Net Zero by 2050.\nAfter 2030, we will continue to focus on implementing carbon reduction measures in our operations. We will then offset the remaining GHG emissions with CO2 certificates that meet estab- lished standards in order to keep our Net Zero 2030 pledge. An internal offsetting guidance has laid the basis for purchasing CO2 certificates. This guidance is meant to ensure the consistency and quality of offset programs.\nCLIMATE ACTION, CDP 2022 C3, C4, C6, C7, C9 AND C12\nThe \u201cR\u201d in our DEGREE sustainability framework stands for re- source efficiency. To exercise product stewardship regarding environmental protection, the comprehensive environmental program Eco Efficiency @ Siemens has defined special environ- mental protection priorities in the categories \u201cRobust Eco Design\u201d and \u201cClean Supply Chain.\u201d\n\u201cRobust Eco Design\u201d (RED) pursues the vision of a product life cycle that is as environmentally compatible as possible, and in which all materials are recycled. At the same time, material and energy flows and losses are to be reduced to a necessary mini- mum.

Key metrics include:\n-Siemens maintains a robust compliance system that focuses on prevention, detection, and response. This system encompasses anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, antitrust, data privacy, export control, and human rights initiatives. The compliance system is overseen by Siemens' Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs), which apply to all workers globally.\n- Siemens has a global, risk-based compliance framework that aims for zero tolerance for violations of applicable laws and internal norms. This approach includes regular compliance risk assessments, which are adapted to specific regions and business units to manage corruption and bribery threats.\n- Siemens ensures that its suppliers follow the company's strict requirements through a Supplier Code of Conduct that includes procedures for avoiding corruption and bribery. Suppliers must sign this code, which is routinely revised to reflect new requirements and regulations.\n- Siemens provides numerous routes for reporting compliance problems, including the \"Tell Us\" whistleblower system and the Ombudsperson service. These technologies allow for anonymous reporting and shield whistleblowers from reprisal.\n- Siemens emphasizes the independence of its investigative committees. Internal investigations are done using clearly defined principles to ensure justice and respect. The investigation process is structured, beginning with the receipt of complaints through multiple reporting channels and ending with internal audits and compliance controls. The Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, ensuring that the investigation is conducted independently of the involved chain of command.\n- Siemens has a robust anti-corruption and bribery training program. The training curriculum comprises the following:\nEvery three years, all Siemens workers must get mandatory training on the Business Conduct Guidelines (BCG). During the current cycle, which ran from 2020 to 2022, 99.9% of all employees worldwide completed this training.\n- Siemens gives specific anti-money laundering training to personnel that deal with risk issues on a regular basis. This course helps in identifying early symptoms of money laundering and terrorist funding, as well as implementing required mitigation steps. Siemens is constantly updating its training content. This ensures that personnel are up to date on the newest anti-corruption laws.\n\nAccording to the precise procedures disclosed in Siemens' ESG report, the business appears to have met all G1-3 regulatory standards for corruption and bribery prevention and detection. However, there is potential for continual development, notably in terms of training scope and frequency to ensure complete coverage and ongoing adaptability to new regulatory situations.\n\n"}]}

Our achievements and progress in the field of sustainabil- ity are equally important. We want our building materials to be used to create intel- ligent, resilient, and sustainable buildings as well as infrastructure for tomorrow \u2013 and we want to keep the ecological footprint associated with their production as small as possible. To underline the importance of sustainability to our business success, we are publishing a combined Annual and Sustainability Report for the first time and underpin our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, whose ten princi- ples relating to human rights, labour standards, the environment, and corruption prevention serve as key guidelines for our entrepreneurial activity.\nHeidelberg Materials \u2013 our new global brand\nYou\u2019ll notice that this report also has a fresh look. In September 2022, we introduced \u201cHeidelberg Materials,\u201d our first global brand in our 150-year history, and work is now underway to gradually roll it out to all Group countries. Our new brand identity will allow us to take full advantage of our organisation\u2019s strengths and represent our positions consistently, both internally and externally. The fact that our colleagues in the Group\u2019s more than 50 countries have responded so positively to our new brand is proof of the great sense of cohesion felt by the Heidelberg Materials team world- wide, I\u2019m personally very pleased of that.\nWe continue to drive our industry\u2019s transformation\nWe have the ambition, the speed, the knowledge, the technologies, and the partners to lead the necessary process of transformation in our sector. Our focus is on ex- panding our portfolio of sustainable products, rapidly and significantly reducing our CO2 emissions, proving that the production of carbon-neutral products is possible on a large scale, and creating a circular economy by rigorously implementing the prin- ciple of circularity. Our recently tightened Sustainability Commitments 2030 under- score this ambition.\n\u201cWe must take the entire value chain into account if we\u2019re to achieve climate neutrality.\u201d\nDr Dominik von Achten\nWe continue to make good progress towards net zero. We succeeded in reducing our specific net CO2 emissions by a further 2% in the 2022 financial year. But we must take the entire value chain into account, from raw materials to reuse, if we\u2019re to achieve climate neutrality. That\u2019s why we pushed ahead our recycling activities, a particular focus of our portfolio optimisation in 2022. By acquiring recycling compa- nies in Germany, the UK, and the USA, we have taken another important step towards implementing our circular economy strategy.\nCCUS roadmap as the key to decarbonisation\nOn our journey towards climate-neutrality, CCUS \u2013 carbon capture, utilisation, and storage \u2013 is a crucial tool for us as a building materials manufacturer when it comes to dealing with the raw material-related process emissions that have been unavoid- able up to now. As early as next year, 2024, we will put the world\u2019s first industrial- scale carbon capture facility at a cement plant into operation in Brevik, Norway. This will make us a front runner in the use of this key technology for decarbonising our industry.\nWith a portfolio of nine innovative, industrial-scale CCUS projects to date, we are continuing to expand our pioneering role. In 2022, we launched our largest CCUS project so far in Mitchell, USA, which will have the capacity to capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year. In early 2023, we announced two more major CCUS projects. At our plant in Antoing, Belgium, we will build a state-of-the-art hybrid carbon capture facility that will help us to reduce our CO2 emissions by 800,000 tonnes. We\u2019re planning the same capacity at our plant in Devnya, Bulgaria. Both projects are scheduled to start in 2028.\n\nTo our stakeholders\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n(Aktiengesetz, AktG). The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that both Mr Mucic and Mr Merckle have exper- tise in the areas of accounting and auditing. For more information, see the Corporate Governance state- ment chapter.\nIn the reporting year, the Personnel Committee fo- cused on the preliminary discussion and recommenda- tion to the Supervisory Board regarding the determina- tion of the variable Managing Board remuneration for the 2021 financial year and on the definition of param- eters for the variable Managing Board remuneration in 2022 and in the years from 2022 to 2024/25, respec- tively. Finally, the Personnel Committee assured itself that all members of the Managing Board have car- ried out the required individual investment in HeidelbergCement AG shares as part of the Managing Board remuneration system.\nThe Sustainability and Innovation Committee, which was newly formed in the reporting year, received re- ports about the Sustainability Office from the Manag- ing Board and dealt with sustainability topics, in par- ticular with regard to the decarbonisation roadmap, ESG benchmarking, and the status and development of the Innovation Hub, a department within the Sustaina- bility Office that brings together and promotes innova- tive ideas.\nDue to the announced resignation from the Super- visory Board of Mr Fritz-J\u00fcrgen Heckmann and Mr Tobias Merckle, the Nomination Committee discussed the issue of succession in the reporting year. It recom- mended that the Supervisory Board propose Dr Bernd Scheifele and Dr Sopna Sury to the 2022 Annual Gen- eral Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board as successors to the two resigning shareholder represent- atives.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 15\n    The Mediation Committee, formed in accordance with section 27(3) of the German Codetermination Law (MitbestG), did not need to meet.\nThe results of the committees\u2019 meetings were reported at the subsequent plenary sessions.\nDuring the reporting year, there were no potential con- flicts of interest of any Managing Board or Supervisory Board member that would have had to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board without undue delay. There were also no consulting or other contracts for services or work between any member of the Supervisory Board and the company in the 2022 reporting year.\nIn the reporting period, there were no transactions with related parties requiring disclosure within the meaning of sections 111a(1)(2) and 111b(1) of the AktG.\nCorporate Governance\nThe declaration of compliance in the reporting year was submitted by the Supervisory Board on 31 January 2022 and by the Managing Board on 11 February 2022. The declaration of compliance for the current year was submitted by the Managing Board on 13 January 2023 and by the Supervisory Board on 30 January 2023. The complete text can be found in the Declaration of com- pliance section pursuant to section 161 of the AktG in the Corporate Governance statement chapter. The current declaration of compliance is made permanent- ly available on the company\u2019s website.\nWith regard to its composition and that of the Manag- ing Board, the Supervisory Board thoroughly complies with the guidelines of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code regarding the principles of diversity when appointing corporate bodies and leadership positions within the Group and of section 289f(2)(6) of the Ger- man Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) (diversity concept). Regarding its own composition, it\nimplements the diversity targets stated in the Code and the profile of skills for the Supervisory Board agreed on 11 September 2017. Detailed information on this topic can be found in the Corporate Governance statement chapter.\nIn March 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to set the target figure for the proportion of women on the Managing Board to at least one woman for the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025. With Dr Nicola Kimm as a member of the Managing Board since 1 September 2021, this target was achieved ahead of schedule. The Supervisory Board also welcomes and supports the Managing Board\u2019s target of further increasing the pro- portion of women in management positions in the first and second leadership levels below the Managing Board. For details, please refer to the Corporate Gov- ernance statement chapter.\nWith regard to the remuneration for the members of the Managing Board for the 2022 financial year, specif- ics are included in the Remuneration report chapter to avoid repetition. A description of the adjusted ver- sion of the Managing Board remuneration system, ap- plicable from 1 January 2021, can also be found here. Having been commissioned to do so by the company, the auditor also carried out the voluntary audit of the correctness of the content of the 2022 remuneration report and issued an unqualified audit opinion. The Su- pervisory Board examined the remuneration report in detail in the presence of the auditor and approved the report together with the Managing Board. The 2022 remuneration report will be submitted to the 2023 An- nual General Meeting for approval and will be available on the company\u2019s website for ten years.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are themselves responsible for obtaining the training required for their tasks and are supported by the company in this respect. The company also offers specific training sessions \u2013\n             \nTo our stakeholders\nReport of the Supervisory Board\nsometimes with external support \u2013 for members of the Supervisory Board, most recently in November 2022. These training courses cover topics that are particular- ly relevant to the company and the work of the Super- visory Board \u2013 for example, with regard to legal chang- es, the selection of suitable investment projects, the ongoing development of the company\u2019s antitrust law compliance system, the company\u2019s risk management system, the implementation of EU taxonomy, and the changes to the German Corporate Governance Code. If required, new members of the Supervisory Board are given an introduction to the legal framework surround- ing the Supervisory Board and can also meet with members of the Managing Board and line managers to discuss fundamental and current issues in order to gain an overview of the topics that are relevant to the com- pany. New Supervisory Board members also receive comprehensive information about the corporate gov- ernance of the company as well as insider law process- es and obligations.\nIn addition, the Managing Board reports on corporate governance at Heidelberg Materials also for the Super- visory Board in the Corporate Governance statement chapter.\nWith the statements listed above, the Supervisory Board has reaffirmed its commitment to effective cor- porate governance in the Group.\nAuditing and approval of annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements, and non-financial statement\nBefore the contract for the auditing of the annual finan- cial statements of the company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group was awarded, the points of focus for the audit and the content of the audit were discussed in detail with the auditor, Price- waterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesell- schaft, Frankfurt am Main. The Audit Committee dis-\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 16\n    cussed the costs of the audit and with the auditor the assessment of audit risk, the audit strategy, audit plan- ning, and the audit results with the auditor. The Chair- man of the Audit Committee and the auditor regularly exchanged information on the progress of the audit, after which the Chairman reported to the committee.\nIn January 2023, the Managing Board informed the Supervisory Board about the preliminary, unaudited key figures for the 2022 financial year and provided a status report on the financial statements work. The an- nual financial statements of HeidelbergCement AG, the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, and the combined management report for the company and the Group, as prepared by the Managing Board, were examined by the auditor. In addition, the auditor performed a limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement (sections 289b and 315b of the HGB) contained in the combined management re- port on behalf of the Supervisory Board. The financial statements together with the reading copies of the au- ditors\u2019 reports were sent in advance to the members of the Supervisory Board. At first, the Audit Committee dealt intensively with the financial statements docu- ments (including the non-financial statement) in the presence of the auditor. The auditor reported on the main results of its audit. In addition, the Audit Commit- tee had the auditor report on the effectiveness of the internal control and early risk identification system in relation to accounting, whereby the auditor stated that he had not found any significant weaknesses in this re- gard. Against this background and after its own con- sideration, the Audit Committee determined that the internal control system, the internal audit system, and the risk management system, including the early risk identification system, meet the requirements to be placed on them. The Supervisory Board shares the opinion of the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of these systems. Then, the Supervisory Board discussed the financial statement documents (including the\nnon-financial statement) in detail, once again in the presence of the auditor. Respective discussions in the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board also took place without the participation of the Managing Board. The Supervisory Board approved the audit results. It examined the annual financial statements and consol- idated financial statements, the combined manage- ment report (including the non-financial statement), and the Managing Board\u2019s proposal for the use of the balance sheet profit. The results of the pre-audit con- ducted by the Audit Committee and the results of its own audit correspond fully to the results of the auditor. The Supervisory Board raised no objections to the final results of this examination. The auditor issued an un- qualified audit opinion on the annual financial state- ments of HeidelbergCement AG and the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022 as well as the combined management report of HeidelbergCement AG and the Group.\nThe Supervisory Board approved the Managing Board\u2019s proposal for the use of the balance sheet profit, includ- ing the payout of a dividend of \u20ac2.60 per share (previ- ous year: \u20ac2.40).\n  \n\nSustainability\nCompliance\nCompliance\nCompliance is a vital element of our corporate values. The public image of Heidelberg Materials is shaped by the conduct of each and every employee. We respect the cultures and laws of the countries in which we operate as well as the local people and institutions. With our Code of Business Conduct, we have introduced a Group-wide set of rules to which all of us are com- mitted.\nCompliant behaviour is at the heart of our business activities\nWe can only achieve success by working as a team \u2013 and compliance is no exception. In turn, this means that compliance work itself must be clearly defined by rules and widely communicated. This is the role of our compliance management system. In addition to over- seeing the system, the Managing Board takes the lead when it comes to reminding the workforce of their com- pliance obligations.\nCompliant behaviour is also integral to our business model. Our production and extraction sites are gener- ally designed for a service life of several decades. To maintain operating permits at our locations over these long periods and to renew our mining concessions at the required intervals, we need the constant support of the public and must prove our integrity time and time again.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 28\n    Our compliance management system\nOur compliance management system consists of seven elements, which are also laid down in the auditing standard 980 issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer in Deutsch- land e.V., IDW).\n\u2013 Our compliance culture is documented in our Code of Business Conduct.\n\u2013 Our Code of Business Conduct and other compliance guidelines also define clear compliance targets.\n\u2013 We generally carry out compliance risk assess- ments to help guide our compliance work, but also to specifically address the topics of anti-corruption and human rights.\n\u2013 Our compliance programme includes, in particular, guidelines, a whistle-blower system and case man- agement, sanctions screening, and reviews of busi- ness partners.\n\u2013 The compliance organisation clearly defines re- sponsibilities and ensures complete coverage of all compliance topics.\n\u2013 Compliance communications include web-based and face-to-face training, videos, posters, online in- formation, compliance letters, and other media use.\n\u2013 Regular compliance checks are primarily carried out by Group Internal Audit.\nWe regularly make our employees aware of compliance matters. The topic is firmly integrated into all work processes through training opportunities and practical application on a daily basis. If there is no specific guide- line on how to act in a particular situation, the compli- ance team can be consulted to give recommendations in line with our ethical standards and our Code of Busi- ness Conduct. We carry out our responsibilities towards customers, suppliers, official bodies, and business partners with honesty, integrity, and professionalism.\nWe believe that adhering to the principles of our Code of Business Conduct ensures the business success of Heidelberg Materials, creates a working environment built on trust, and leads to higher levels of satisfaction among all of our company\u2019s stakeholders. Non-financial statement\n\n\nSustainability\nOur employees\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 56\n    trend through active generation management and by offering numerous health management and preventive care measures adapted to regional requirements.\nFlexible working time models, a digital workplace, and mobile working have become the norm for us in our commitment to work-life balance. This offering is com- plemented by virtual workshops and preventive screen- ing, covering many different health topics, as part of our health management activities. The sports groups, courses, and our own gym at our headquarters support mental and physical health. To promote sustainable and flexible mobility, we also subsidise offers such as the JobTicket public transport and JobRad bike leasing schemes.\nThrough trainee programmes, dual apprenticeship and study partnerships, specialist and managerial develop- ment, and professional training, we invest specifically in the best possible qualification of our employees. With our e-campus and the possibility of international work assignments, we can also hold our own in the global labour market.\nRemuneration policy and working time regulation\nThe remuneration systems at Heidelberg Materials are based on performance and results in accordance with the market standards for internationally operating companies in our sector. Alongside fixed remuneration governed by a collective agreement or an individual work contract, our employees also receive variable re- muneration elements based on their individual perfor- mance and on corporate success. Our CO2 reduction\ntargets are consistently anchored in our global remu- neration systems as well: the full variable remuneration can only be achieved if both the financial targets and the sustainability target are met. This regulation has applied to all members of the Managing Board and to every bonus-eligible employee worldwide since the start of the 2021 financial year.\nWe consciously aim to achieve a high variable element as part of the total remuneration of our managers in order to directly reflect the connection between per- sonal performance and corporate success.\nCollective regulations apply to more than half of the Group\u2019s employees. The employees in our foreign sub- sidiaries benefit otherwise from attractive remunera- tion systems that correspond to the respective local market conditions.\nOur working time regulations comply with the legal re- quirements in effect at our respective locations. We promote adherence to these regulations by means of our whistle-blower system, which employees can use to individually report possible violations (passive monitor- ing). To enable flexible working time options, we offer models such as flexitime, working time accounts, part- time work, and leaves of absence, for example in the form of a sabbatical, to our employees in many coun- tries. Older employees also have the option of switch- ing to partial retirement.\nEmployment and co-determination\nEmployee co-determination has always been of great importance to us. Statutory, collective bargaining, and company regulations are implemented jointly in close cooperation with employee representatives. The works council and Group management work together in a spirit of trust.\nIn accordance with the defined co-determination and participation rights, the relevant committees are in- formed in good time so that opinions can be obtained, and then agreements are made with them. Heidelberg Materials works consistently and intensively with em- ployee representatives in a spirit of trust. These repre- sentatives are involved in numerous committees and are informed at an early stage about operational changes. In the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation to achieve a socially re- sponsible solution and, for example, initially examine the possibility of transferring employees within the Group. If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the indi- vidual impact through retraining, early-retirement schemes, outplacement, and severance payments. Non-financial statement\n \nSustainability\nOur employees\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 58\n    Education\nFor Heidelberg Materials, forward-looking HR manage- ment means consistently investing in training. With an apprentice retention rate of 85% in Germany, steady growth of qualified young talent is guaranteed.\nIn addition to technical skills for ensuring functionally sound processes, digital competences have also be- come indispensable. We already cover the technical part with virtual learning platforms and multilingual e-learning courses, specifically developed by the Ger- man Cement Works Association (VDZ). A complete ed- ucational offering is ensured through additional train- ing covering professional use of programmes for virtual communication and cooperation, how to deal personally with the new work and life situation, and topics of mental health and resilience.\nAs a manufacturing Group, occupational safety is al- ways a key element of our training and career develop- ment programmes. In addition, we focus our efforts on specialist training and the training of our managers. Our training programmes in virtually every work area are characterised by practical and business-oriented learning and enable our employees to develop their skills in the best possible way.\nThe Cement Academy of the Competence Center Cement (CCC) offers seminars and training sessions around the world for the engineers and technicians at our cement plants, while the Aggregates Academy of the Competence Center Aggregates & Asphalt (CCA) provides apprenticeships and employee training in the aggregates business line. Process simulators and various web-based learning programmes, including the\nmultilingual Cement Manufacturing Curriculum, on which more than 3,000 employees are enrolled, are regularly used to supplement our classroom courses.\nStrengthening digital competences\nThere is undeniably a need to build and expand digital competences, drive change processes in the context of digital transformation, and further digitalise personnel processes and systems. Our efforts are focused on fundamental digital media skills as well as topics relat- ed to specific functions. To increase the transparency of our digital activities for employees, all key global digitalisation projects and the tools used within the Group are explained on a platform to which all employ- ees have access. We used external training databases to also significantly expand e-learning offerings on var- ious digitalisation topics in the past year.\nTraining on the use of virtual communication and col- laboration tools also accounted for a large part of de- mand in the past year. To meet this demand, we offer both in-house courses and comprehensive digital train- ing and certification from external partners (Microsoft certification tracks).\nSuccessor planning\nSecuring and developing junior executives is an impor- tant pillar of our personnel development strategy. We have intensified our activities aimed at expanding our development programmes and strengthening our re- cruitment of university graduates worldwide. We offer them extensive, international trainee programmes fo- cusing on the areas of technology, sales, finance, HR, and procurement, as well as interdisciplinary posts.\nThrough a special programme, we also equip highly qualified engineers in the cement business for senior engineering positions. The participants undergo indi- vidually tailored training programmes that allow them to gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to prepare them for the next stage of their career. Spending time at cement plants in different countries is a key element of the programme\u2019s success.\nSince 2013, Heidelberg Materials has been the proud recipient of the trainee seal of the German initiative for career-enhancing and fair trainee programmes each year for our programmes for the advancement of future executives. As a member of the Fair Company initiative and bearer of the Fair Company seal, we have also been voluntarily committed to the creation of fair and attractive working conditions for trainees and young professionals. Non-financial statement\n \n\nWe work hard to minimise and prevent risks for our em- ployees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties. To this end, we carry out regular risk assessments at our locations so that we can evaluate risks and take appropriate protective measures. Based on the results of these risk assessments, we have introduced and continuously updated various Group-wide safety standards in recent years in order to address activities with particularly high risks consistently. These stand- ards are translated into local measures at our locations and, if necessary, supplemented by additional meas- ures. As part of workplace inspections, we check com- pliance with these internal standards as well as with other legally mandated external requirements. Any shortcomings we identify are rectified as quickly as possible.\nAll our measures give due consideration not only to our own employees but also to the employees of external companies. They work for us in areas such as produc- tion, maintenance and repair, transport, other services, and consulting. We have therefore addressed the issue of contractor safety with a separate Group standard to take account of the particular requirements placed on external companies as well as those that must be met by Heidelberg Materials when engaging external companies.\nTransport is another important focus of our work, as traffic accidents have unfortunately repeatedly led to uninvolved third parties sustaining injuries or even los- ing their lives. We address this issue in training courses for our own drivers and those who drive on our behalf. The driver training courses aim to raise drivers\u2019 safety\nawareness so that they can identify and reduce poten- tial risks at an early stage. This training in defensive driving is not only theory based; it is also increasingly delivered using driving simulators, at driving safety centers, or through supervised driving. In addition, we are making greater use of technical aids. As well as fitting vehicles with various assistance systems and using such systems, examples of this approach also include checking the roadworthiness of third-party vehicles before loading.\nImproving mental health\nIn addition to the measures outlined above for the pre- vention of accidents and standard occupational dis- eases, various Group countries are also increasingly working with external organisations in order to improve the mental health of employees. The idea is to raise awareness of mental health problems and train em- ployees to recognise warning signs and offer support. The aim of the measures is to dispel prejudices and encourage those affected to talk about their problems and seek help.\nIn recognition of the sensitivity of the topic and to make it easier for those affected to access appropriate services, many of our subsidiaries offer external sup- port programmes that provide help anonymously and free of charge. Countries in which such programmes are available include Germany, the UK, Belgium, Canada, the USA, and Australia.\nNon-financial statement\n \n\n    As a global Group with a strong regional business fo- cus, we operate at many locations across the world. Our production and quarrying sites are generally de- signed for a service life of several decades. To maintain acceptance of our business activities at the sites over these long periods, we are active in the communities close to our plants and fulfil our corporate social re- sponsibility (CSR). We create jobs and promote local economic development with our wages, investment, purchasing, and taxes, particularly in economically weak regions.\nSocial engagement at our locations\nWe have made a commitment to social responsibility in our Code of Business Conduct. At our locations, we strive for a constructive, trusting, and neighbourly re- lationship with local residents. We support the social and economic development of our neighbouring com- munities and foster transparent communication with all stakeholders. We aim to work with local partners to create added value both for our Group and for the local communities. People in the communities where we op- erate also expect us to contribute to the areas sur- rounding our production sites by regularly providing information about our business activities and through our commitment to local social, economic, and environ- mental development. Taking social responsibility and\nmaintaining good relationships with our stakeholders \u2013 particularly at our production sites \u2013 are management tasks. The national management team, together with the national CSR manager, is responsible for social en- gagement in each country. Funding decisions for indi- vidual countries are made by the national management teams within their budgetary framework. Together with the location representatives, they are also responsible for analysing local needs and for selecting, implement- ing, and monitoring projects.\nInvolving local communities\nWe involve local communities in our business activities through various dialogue formats as well as communi- ty engagement plans. Among other things, these strat- egies include long-term partnerships with non-govern- mental and non-profit organisations. In addition, we keep the local communities and stakeholders informed via newsletters or at open days.\nWe have also defined clear evaluation criteria to ensure that our activities are both transparent and effective. We support projects, initiatives, and organisations that are active at our locations or to which we have a direct link. We attach great importance to ensuring that the guidelines and principles of these organisations align with our own corporate philosophy.\nOur engagement is focused on the following areas:\n\u2013 Culture: we promote cultural initiatives for all age groups in our local communities.\n\u2013 Environment: we support initiatives that promote environmental protection and strengthen the diver- sity of nature at our locations.\n\u2013 Infrastructure: we provide practical help in the con- struction of buildings and infrastructure by making products, financial means, and expertise available.\n\u2013 Education: in this area, we are guided by the specif- ic needs of our locations. We foster potential and encourage initiatives such as education partner- ships.\nFocus of our engagement in 2022\nAt Heidelberg Materials, we stepped up our humanitar- ian efforts in 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. The country organisation in Poland, for example, took direct action and made the conference center on site available to host refugees. In addition to nu- merous other initiatives there, financial aid was provid- ed for Ukrainian students at the University of Opole, a charity run was organised, and deliveries of relief sup- plies to Ukraine were supported. In Germany, too, one of our buildings was made available to host refugees and a fundraising campaign was organised among employees.\n\nCombined management report\nFundamentals of the Group\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 business model encompasses the entire value chain, from the extraction of raw ma- terials to further processing into cement through to the end product, concrete and its recycling.\nHeidelberg Materials operates as a fully integrated building materials company. Key business processes include the extraction of raw materials, the production of building materials, as well as their sales and distri- bution to customers. Operating activities are support- ed by central competence centers for technology as well as by shared service centers in individual countries and regions. Operating business processes include the geological exploration of raw material deposits, the purchase or lease of the land where the deposits are located, applying for mining concessions and environ- mental impact assessments, the construction of man- ufacturing facilities in cooperation with external service providers, as well as the actual production of building materials, including extracting raw materials, process- ing and recycling building materials, and maintenance of the facilities.\nProducts\nOur core products cement, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt are homogeneous bulk goods. Their product characteristics are mostly standardised in order to ensure the required stability, reliability, and processability in the application.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 67\n    Cements are classified according to their early and final strength as well as their composition. In addition to cements that consist of almost 100% clinker, there are so-called composite cements, in which a portion of the clinker is replaced by alternative raw materials, such as fly ash, ground slag, or limestone. Cement is used as a binder mainly in concrete production.\nAggregates (sand, gravel, and crushed rock) are clas- sified according to their particle size and texture. They are the main component in the production of concrete and asphalt but are also used as base courses in the construction of infrastructure, such as roads.\nConcrete is a mixture of aggregates (about 80%), cement (about 12%), and water. Concrete is usually delivered to the construction site by ready-mix trucks and is poured locally into forms. Moreover, concrete is also used for the production of precast concrete parts, such as stairs, ceiling elements, or structural compo- nents.\nAsphalt is a mixture of aggregates (about 95%) and bitumen and is generally used as a top layer in road construction.\nLocations and sales markets\nDue to the heavy weight of cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete in proportion to their price, pro- duction is usually located in close proximity to the sales markets. The cement transportation radius by road normally does not exceed 200 km. The delivery radius for aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt by road is generally less than 100 km. Consequently, we have local production sites in more than 50 countries in which we offer building materials.\nWe operate around 130 cement plants (plus a further 20 as part of joint ventures), just under 600 quarries and aggregates pits, as well as around 1,320 ready- mixed concrete production sites worldwide. In total, the Group employs 50,780 people at around 2,500 loca- tions on five continents. There are additionally more than 350 production sites belonging to joint ventures.\nOrganisational structure\nThe Group is divided into five geographical Group areas: Western and Southern Europe, Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia, North America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin. Our global trading activities, especially the trading of cement and clinker, are pooled together in the sixth Group area, Group Services.\nWithin the geographical Group areas, we have divided our activities into four business lines. The cement and aggregates business lines comprise the essential raw materials that are required for the manufacture of the downstream products ready-mixed concrete and as- phalt, which are combined in our third business line. The fourth business line, service-joint ventures-other, pri- marily covers the activities of our joint ventures.\n\n\nCountries/locations\nImportance of sustainability to the business model\nWe want to significantly reduce the impact of our busi- ness activities on the climate and lower our carbon footprint. As a leading building materials manufacturer, we see it as our responsibility to play a decisive role in transforming our industry to meet current and future needs. We want to make a substantial contribution to sustainable construction and carbon neutrality and assume social and environmental responsibility.\nClimate protection is an integral part of the Group strategy. The production of cement generates a large amount of CO2 due to the chemical processes involved in burning clinker and the high temperatures this re- quires. Therefore, we are making greater use of alter- native raw materials and fuels to reduce CO2 emissions. We also optimise our production processes to increase energy efficiency. To reduce the consumption of pri- mary raw materials, we are committed to circularity and strengthening the circular economy. At product level, our focus is on the broad introduction of low-car- bon cements and concretes, the use of recycled mate-\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nInformation according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system that translates the EU\u2019s climate and environmental ob- jectives into criteria for certain environmentally sus- tainable economic activities for investment purposes. Economic activities are recognised as \u201cenvironmental- ly sustainable\u201d if they make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives while not significantly harming any of the other defined environmental objectives. In addition, minimum social standards must be met.\nAssessment of taxonomy eligibility\nThe portfolio of our business activities was assessed in the reporting year with regard to taxonomy eligibility under the delegated acts on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition to 3.7 Manufacture of ce- ment (represented in the following as the cement busi- ness line), 5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste (represented in the following as the recycled ag- gregates operating line within the aggregates business line) has been identified as a relevant economic activi- ty (see Circular economy section) and included in the reporting pursuant to the requirements of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. There are also other tax- onomy-eligible economic activities within Heidelberg Materials\u2019 business lines, such as transport services, which are, however, not shown separately and are in- cluded in the reporting for the cement business line and activity 3.7.\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 other business activities, such as the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line, are taxonomy-non-eligible under the currently known legal acts. We also analysed cross-sectional economic ac- tivities for the CapEx and OpEx KPIs, but this did not result in any additional reportable activities.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 114\n    Review of the technical screening criteria\nThe technical screening criteria for taxonomy align- ment with the act on climate change mitigation were reviewed by an interdisciplinary working group and with the involvement of further experts, especially with re- gard to the interpretation of the \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d (DNSH) criteria. The requirements of the climate change adaptation act were not pursued further, as we are currently unable to achieve taxonomy-aligned rev- enue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure in accordance with the regulation.\nTo review the criteria determining whether a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (substantial contribution criteria) is made, internal reporting sys- tems and data were used to verify compliance with the respective limit values at plant level. The analysis dif- ferentiates between the various types of plants (inte- grated plants, clinker plants, grinding plants) on the basis of the reporting definitions set out by the GCCA industry association.\nFor the somewhat more qualitative DNSH criteria, the individual (legal) requirements and their applicability to Heidelberg Materials were reviewed and potential ap- proaches for proving the alignment of the individual plants were devised. For example, a location-based assessment for climate change adaptation was devel- oped, covering various climate scenarios and time ho- rizons. If risks are identified, the plants will be expected to implement appropriate adaptation measures. At the same time, for criteria such as \u201cprotection and resto- ration of biodiversity and ecosystems\u201d or \u201csustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\u201d use is made of existing processes. We regularly assess the proximity of our operational sites to protected areas and, if necessary, develop biodiversity management plans. For the \u201csustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\u201d criterion, we have extended our existing approach of creating water management\nplans and make use of the assessment of (potential) risks and impacts carried out for this purpose.\nFor the manufacture of cement and the \u201cpollution pre- vention and control\u201d criterion, we use, among other things, our long-established processes for monitoring air pollutants to verify compliance. We have also exam- ined the additional requirements for the products we manufacture, such as those relating to placing hazard- ous substances on the market. We come to the conclu- sion that these criteria are fulfilled. With respect to circular economy, there are no requirements within the Taxonomy Regulation for 3.7 Manufacture of cement and 5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste.\nIn order to comply with the minimum safeguards, we have closely coordinated with the Group Legal and Compliance department and compared our existing measures on human rights, anti-corruption, fair com- petition, and taxation with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. As we have been implementing compliance processes in these areas for many years and are continuously reviewing and expanding them, we have come to the conclusion that the minimum safeguards are being met. One current example of our continuous optimisation efforts, is our work in the field of human rights to further expand our analysis of sig- nificant risks and their impact on potentially affected parties. Particularly with respect to our supply chains, we have supplemented our existing risk management with suitable processes (in the context of the require- ments of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), among other things). Further information on this topic can be found in the Compliance section.\nExplanation of the key figures\nThe key figures revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) relevant to the Tax- onomy Regulation were determined with reference to the definitions set out in the Annex to the Delegated\n  \n\nThe image is a detailed infographic illustrating various sustainability commitments and demographic data for an organization. The infographic is structured around commitments for a \"safe and inclusive future\" and includes statistics on leadership, training, and workforce demographics. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Sustainability Commitments\n1. **25% of Leadership Positions Filled by Women**: This commitment indicates the organization's goal to enhance gender diversity in leadership roles.\n2. **100% of Sites to Have Community Engagement Plans by 2030**: This commitment shows the organization\u2019s dedication to being actively involved in community engagement across all its locations by the year 2030.\n3. **50% Reduction in LTIFR (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) Compared with 2020**: The organization aims to halve its rate of workplace injuries that result in time lost from work, compared to the year 2020, and aims for zero fatalities.\n4. **1 Day of Paid Leave for Voluntary Community Work Per Year**: This policy offers all employees one day of paid leave annually to engage in voluntary community service.\n\n### Workforce Demographics\n1. **Age Structure within the Group**:\n   - **Under 30 Years**: 11% of the workforce\n   - **30-49 Years**: 51% of the workforce\n   - **50+ Years**: 38% of the workforce\n   These statistics provide insight into the age distribution of the organization's employees, indicating a mature workforce with the majority being between 30 and 49 years old.\n\n2. **14% Share of Female Executives**: This data point details the percentage of female employees holding executive roles with leadership responsibilities (referred to as N-1 and N-2 levels).\n\n### Training Hours\n- **28 Hours Per Employee**: The infographic also breaks down the average training hours per employee:\n   - **Occupational Safety Training**: 55%\n   - **Specialist Training**: 30%\n   - **Other**: 5%\n   - **Soft Skills Training**: 4%\n   - **Management Training**: 4%\n   - **Language Courses**: 2%\n   This indicates the organization\u2019s focus on continuous learning and development, with a significant emphasis on occupational safety and specialist training.\n\nOverall, the infographic effectively communicates the organization\u2019s key sustainability initiatives and workforce demographics, highlighting its commitment to safety, community engagement, and diversity. The distribution of training topics underscores a robust approach to professional development, ensuring employees are well-equipped for their roles.\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nResponsibility towards our employees Employees\nHeidelberg Materials has around 51,000 employees worldwide. We want to offer attractive working condi- tions and jobs with a secure future. For us, a good per- sonnel policy means respecting our employees with their range of talents, qualities, and diversity of expe- rience as well as creating the right conditions to allow them to do their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As a manufacturing company, we also attach importance to occupational safety and the protection of our em- ployees\u2019 health.\nAt the end of 2022, the number of employees at Heidelberg Materials stood at 50,780 (previous year: 51,209), based on full-time equivalents. The decrease of around 430 employees essentially results from two opposing developments. On the one hand, around 1,200 jobs were cut across the Group as a result of portfolio optimisation measures, the realisation of synergies, efficiency gains in sales and administration, as well as location optimisations. On the other hand, around 770 new employees joined the Group, among others in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Information on the number of employees in the Group areas can be found in the segment reporting.\nIn the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation with employee representatives to achieve a socially responsible solution. For example, we initially examine the possibility of transferring em- ployees within the Group. If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the individual impact through retraining, early-retirement schemes, outplacement, and sever- ance payments.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 120\n    Diversity, equity, and inclusion\nGroup-wide, we aim for a mix of diverse nationalities, personalities, skills, and experience. We see the diver- sity in our workforce in terms of cultural and ethnic or- igin, gender, age, mental and physical abilities, and sexual orientation and identity as an asset to our glob- al teams. We are convinced that this diversity, in har- mony with an appreciative corporate culture, has a positive effect on our innovative strength and the com- mitment of our employees.\nThe international composition of our top and senior management also gives us the benefit of a broad range of experience from different cultural backgrounds. This allows us to respond flexibly and quickly to global chal- lenges as well as local market needs. The proportion of local managers at the upper management level amounts to around 80%.\nAt our headquarters, we aim to ensure that the work- force is composed of employees from the countries in which we operate, with the intention of improving cooperation with local personnel. Currently, more than 50 different nationalities are represented at our head- quarters.\nThere are trade unions and similar organisations in nearly all of the countries in which Heidelberg Materials operates. We also engage in regular, open dialogue with representatives of these organisations.\nTargets and commitments\nOur aim is to attract and develop highly qualified and committed employees worldwide who bring their indi- vidual skills and different perspectives to our company and thus contribute to our business success.\nIn 2022, we defined a new, ambitious target for the proportion of women at management level. In Germa- ny, we want the proportion of women in the first and second leadership levels below the Managing Board to reach 27% on each level by 2027. Our global target is for women to occupy 25% of management positions by 2030.\nWe have been signatories to the Diversity Charter since early 2013.\nResponsibility and organisation\nThe Group Human Resources (HR) department is sub- ordinate to the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the Director Group Human Resources reports directly. Group HR is also responsible for the topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Each country has its own personnel organisation and sets country-specific human resources priorities. The individual HR directors of the countries report directly to the general manager of the respective country and, in a functional reporting line, to the Group Human Resources department.\nMembers of the employee committees at the individu- al locations form the General Works Council for HeidelbergCement AG and the Group Works Council. The representative body for severely disabled employ- ees is embedded in the local works council for the headquarters in Heidelberg.\nPolicies\nHeidelberg Materials is committed to upholding the core labour standards of the International Labour Or- ganization (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights developed by the United Nations. More- over, we have enshrined this commitment in our Lead- ership Principles. We expect our employees worldwide\n\nto comply with these central guidelines and recommen- dations.\nOur Code of Business Conduct is binding across the Group and describes our values as well as our ethical and legal standards. These include non-discriminatory employment conditions and an open and fair dialogue with employee representatives.\nWith the Company Agreement on Mobile Working in Germany, we are placing particular emphasis on mak- ing our working time models more flexible in order to help our employees achieve a better work-life balance.\nWe have defined guidelines within the Group that concern, for example, respectful behaviour towards co-workers, the involvement and development of em- ployees, a commitment to a strong feedback culture, and the importance of our customers to our corporate success. We urge our managers and employees world- wide to adapt the way they behave towards one anoth- er accordingly, taking local circumstances into ac- count.\nProcesses\nEmployee and employer representatives maintain a close and regular dialogue. For instance, monthly meetings take place between Human Resources repre- sentatives and the works councils at the various loca- tions. Furthermore, the works council organises quar- terly staff meetings at the headquarters, which are attended by the Chairman of the Managing Board and the Director Group Human Resources every six months. A meeting of the General Works Council is held once a year, to which the Chairman of the Managing Board, the Managing Director of the German organisation, the Director Group Human Resources, and the Director HR for Germany are invited. In addition, the works council has formed various committees which liaise with the Group Human Resources department as required.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 121\n    Examples include the Personnel Planning Committee, data protection, IT systems, and monthly meetings with the works council at headquarters. Group man- agement and employee representatives also engage in an established, constructive dialogue in the European Works Council.\nHuman resources issues are considered at Managing Board meetings to which the Director Group Human Resources is invited depending on the topic. The Super- visory Board meets at specified intervals to discuss personnel issues related to the Managing Board.\nWe have embedded key leadership principles in stand- ard human resources processes. In annual salary re- view processes, we ensure that the remuneration of our managers and employees not covered by collective agreements develops appropriately for each individu- al. As part of a structured target agreement process, managers and employees jointly define the forthcom- ing tasks and expectations. Individual performance appraisals also have an impact on remuneration. A fur- ther purpose of career development discussions is to support our employees\u2019 development and career planning. These processes have been automated for 11 years through our HR Globe HR system and offer self-service features for employees and managers. A total of around 10,000 employees worldwide are reg- istered in the system. Over 35,000 employees have access to e-campus, our current learning management system, in which we offer training activities on special- ist and general work-related topics. We began working on the introduction of our new Workday HR system in a Group-wide project in 2021 with the intention of establishing it as the Group\u2019s central HR IT system worldwide.\nWorkday will gradually replace systems such as e-cam- pus and HR Globe. We laid the foundation with the global roll-out of Workday in December 2022. More than 45,000 employees are monitored with their HR master data in the system. The roll-out of further mod- ules is planned for 2023, including processes relating to talent management.\nMeasures and progress\nIn recent years, we have further developed our meas- ures aimed at promoting women. The proportion of women in programmes for the advancement of future executives across Germany was 31% (previous year: 31%) and therefore, as in previous years, significantly higher than the proportion of women in the total work- force in Germany of 16.9% (previous year: 15.9%). We also provide targeted support for the career develop- ment of our female future executives. In Germany, for example, we participate in a cross-company mentoring programme in cooperation with other companies from the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, where our head- quarters is located.\nThe global NOW \u2013 Network of Women, which was launched at Heidelberg Materials in 2011, connects female employees around the world virtually and in person and supports individual career development as well as promoting women in general. The initiative aims, among other things, to support the network\u2019s mem- bers in developing their career potential and to build greater awareness throughout the company of the changing demands on working and living environments. The Allies of NOW programme, introduced in 2021, also offers opportunities for male employees to advocate for gender equality at Heidelberg Materials.\nAs in previous years, Heidelberg Materials took part in activities for German Diversity Day in 2022.\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nThe steps taken in previous years regarding travel re- strictions and protective measures taken at individual locations in response to the coronavirus pandemic were adapted in the reporting year to the relevant local infection situations and regulations. Although many measures have been lifted altogether, some remain in many places because they have proven effective as preventive measures against other infectious diseases, such as flu. These include the increased provision of disinfectants, the installation of physical partitions, and more virtual meetings.\nIn 2022, we continued training our employees on a range of occupational safety topics, including both legally mandated and internally defined topics relating to key hazards that are relevant locally and across the Group. By doing so, we aim to increase awareness of risks and further reduce the number of accidents, es- pecially those resulting in fatalities.\nWe make use of conventional training in classrooms or on site in addition to e-learning courses, which are only ever used to supplement face-to-face training. Occu- pational safety topics account for around 55% of all training hours at Heidelberg Materials, corresponding to an average of approximately 15 hours per employee across the Group.\nIn addition to the conventional training activities, safe- ty conversations also play a central role as a preventive measure against accidents. During these conversa- tions between managers and employees, both safe and unsafe behaviour in the relevant situation are dis- cussed and, if necessary, safer procedures are agreed. In 2022, we asked managers to place a strong focus on conducting last-minute risk assessments in their safety conversations. Our analyses of the causes of accidents show that some accidents could have been prevented if an additional short risk assessment had been performed immediately before the work was car-\nHeidelberg Materials\n2022 124\n    ried out, i.e. at the last minute, taking into account fac- tors such as the current weather conditions or the health of the employees. By focusing more on this is- sue, we want to build greater awareness of this impor- tant preventive step on the part of both management and employees. We record the results of the safety conversations in HC Protect so that, for example, we can detect local pockets of unsafe behaviour. By carry- ing out regular safety inspections, we want to contrib- ute towards compliance with the defined safety re- quirements.\nPerformance indicators\nLost time injury frequency rate increased slightly in the reporting year to 1.7 (previous year: 1.6). The lost time injury severity rate, on the other hand, decreased sig- nificantly from 95 to 79. This development shows that on average we had fewer serious accidents with long periods of absence. The increased focus on conducting \u201clast minute\u201d risk assessments as a preventive measure is likely to have had a positive impact here. In the busi- ness year 2022, we had to mourn the death of one of our own employees and four employees of contractors lost their lives. In four cases, the accidents occurred during work to remedy unexpected disruptions in the operating process, and in another case there was a traffic accident in the quarry.\n\nAs a global Group, Heidelberg Materials is subject to a variety of legal requirements, which vary from country to country. In order to take account of these differenc- es and ensure corporate governance, we have imple- mented a compliance management system across the Group. Within this framework, we carry out compliance risk assessments every four years, most recently in 2020, and determine areas of focus for the content of the compliance programme. This is done by conducting structured interviews with the general managers of the country organisations and the Group directors. Com- pliance risk areas are identified and ranked. The risks in the topic areas of corruption, competition law, and human rights are among the ten most important risks that we mitigate by means of our compliance manage- ment system.\nCorruption topic area\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 business activity involves signif- icant cash flows, particularly in sales, procurement, financing, and investments, providing opportunities for corruption to occur in all countries of the world. Ac- cording to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index, many of the countries in which\n\nWe apply a zero tolerance policy to violations of appli- cable laws, regulations, and internal company policies. We also expect our employees and business partners worldwide to comply with key guidelines and recom- mendations, such as the principles of the eight core labour standards of the International Labour Organi- zation (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational En- terprises, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. All suppliers are also obli- gated to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct.\nOur management and monitoring structures are regu- lated in the company\u2019s Articles of Association, the\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 125\n    Rules of Procedure of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and are in line with the German Corporate Governance Code (see Corporate Governance state- ment chapter).\nThe impacts of any new investment on our compliance management system and, in particular, our human rights obligations are also part of our due diligence process. Human rights and business considerations are both taken into account when making investment decisions.\nResponsibility and organisation\nThe compliance programme, which is anchored in the Group-wide management and supervisory structures, is part of our management culture. It comprises the entire compliance organisation within the Group, the set-up of guidelines, and the verification of compliance with these guidelines. The compliance management addresses all compliance topics that Heidelberg Materials has identified as relevant in the compliance risk assessment.\nThe compliance organisation is under the authority of the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the Director Group Legal & Compliance reports directly. Each country has its own compliance officer, who re- ports directly to the country manager and indirectly to the Group Compliance department. The Compliance function is also responsible for the compliance manage- ment system for human rights. In 2022, the Managing Board appointed a Group human rights officer. In order to implement the human rights compliance programme, two new positions have been created in the Group Compliance department with a focus on human rights expertise. The future incumbents will cover topics rang- ing from risk analysis to preventive and remedial meas- ures \u2013 in both their own business line and the supply chain. Since the end of 2022, a human rights coordina-\ntor has been responsible for human rights compliance management in each of the country organisations. In addition, the country organisations appoint environ- mental experts to assist human rights coordinators as partners in assessing and addressing human rights risks related to environmental aspects.\nPolicies\nOur compliance principles are laid down in the Code of Business Conduct, which covers all compliance topics identified as material for Heidelberg Materials. The or- ganisation of the compliance management system is defined in the internal Compliance Policy.\nIn 2022, we specified standardised rules for all govern- ance documents in a new framework policy. Against this background, several compliance policies have also been adjusted, such as our Group Compliance Incident Reporting & Case Management Guideline, which lays down the principles for reporting compliance issues, processing and investigating submitted complaints, and protecting those reporting the incidents.\nThe Group Anti-Corruption Guideline defines principles such as behaving with integrity towards business part- ners or avoiding conflicts of interest.\nAs regards competition law, the acceptable behaviour for Heidelberg Materials is derived firstly from the ap- plicable antitrust laws including relevant international regulations, such as the antitrust regulations in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. In its Code of Busi- ness Conduct and with the Group Competition Law Guideline, the content of which was also adjusted in 2022, plus the national antitrust law guidelines based on the latter, Heidelberg Materials has made an explic- it internal commitment to strict compliance with anti- trust laws, such as the prohibition of cartels and the abuse of a dominant market position, as well as with the rules of merger control.\n\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 position on human rights is a commitment by the Group to respect human rights. Among other things, it addresses employees\u2019 working conditions, responsibility at our locations (including the rights of indigenous peoples), and the selection of sup- pliers and customers. The internal Guideline on Human Rights Compliance Management regulates the organi- sation and responsibilities associated with implement- ing compliance with human rights.\nProcesses\nThe compliance programme integrated across the Group serves as a cornerstone for achieving our com- pliance targets. A central element of this programme is the self-commitment made by the Group management not to tolerate violations of applicable laws and to im- pose sanctions. The programme also includes internal guidelines and measures that express the legal provi- sions in concrete terms. In addition, suitable corrective and preventive measures are taken to help prevent sim- ilar incidents in the future. Further to annual communi- cation of these guidelines, compliance letters and vid- eo messages are circulated to the workforce. Software is used for the administration of compliance tasks and reporting. The intention is that this will also replace the previous software for compliance risk assessments in 2023. Furthermore, we have established SpeakUp, a web- and telephone-based reporting system accessi- ble across the Group and also to people outside the organisation.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 126\n    As well as face-to-face training, employee training is also carried out online. The range of digital courses, which are mandatory for specified groups of employ- ees, covers topics such as the Code of Business Con- duct, competition law, and the prevention of corrup- tion. In order to achieve a 100% completion rate for all digital compliance training, we require the country managers to additionally report on training attend- ance to the responsible member of the Managing Board. The group of persons required to attend the on- line training courses includes, depending on the course, all employees who have a company email address or employees of specific departments and/or managers. The training courses are mandatory for new hires and are repeated every two years. In addition, training ses- sions are conducted on other compliance topics such as human rights or money laundering. They are carried out both at the request of specific departments and on the instructions of the Compliance function.\nThe entire compliance programme is continuously re- viewed for the need to adapt to current legal and social developments by keeping track of news and exchang- ing information with compliance experts, and is im- proved and further developed accordingly.\nGroup-wide implementation of the compliance pro- gramme is monitored by regular and special audits by Group Internal Audit as well as via half-yearly reporting by the Director Group Legal & Compliance to the Man- aging Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervi- sory Board. The latter monitors the effectiveness of the compliance programme and verifies in particular whether it adequately satisfies the legal requirements and recognised compliance standards. An additional quarterly report informs the Managing Board members with regional responsibility about the most important compliance incidents in their Group areas. Following the adequacy assessment of the compliance manage- ment system of HeidelbergCement AG carried out in\n2021 on the basis of the IDW PS980 auditing standard, which was confirmed without qualification of the audit opinion, the recommendations for improvement have either already been implemented in 2022 or are in im- plementation.\nApproximately every three years, we conduct a com- prehensive analysis to assess and prevent corruption risks and possible conflicts of interest. A rolling ap- proach ensures that different Group countries are an- alysed each year as part of this cycle. First, the poten- tial risks within a country organisation are assessed. Then, the measures already in place to limit these risks are evaluated, and finally, we examine whether further measures are needed. On the basis of this assessment, an action plan is drawn up for each country, and its implementation is monitored by the Group Legal & Compliance department.\nIn the area of competition law, we have a comprehen- sive reporting system on antitrust investigation pro- ceedings. An annual competition law update takes place at the level of the Managing Board and of the employees who report directly to the members of the Managing Board with responsibility for sales. Further- more, annual qualitative assessments of the antitrust risks take place in the countries. A regular external au- dit of the competition law compliance programme is conducted by a specialist law firm approximately every three years.\nWe have established management processes that allow us to exercise effective human rights due diligence and in our opinion meet the requirements of both the United Nations Guiding Principles and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG).\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nIn our country organisations, we carry out human rights risk analyses, which are currently still scheduled to be repeated every three years. The exact timetable is agreed individually with each country organisation. From 2023, HeidelbergCement AG is required by law to carry out annual risk reviews. The process will consider risks relating to discrimination, child or forced labour, risks to freedom of association and collective bargain- ing, risks to fair and safe working conditions, to the right of peoples to self-determination, and to the rights of indigenous peoples. The analysis includes determin- ing potential risks from the perspective of different functions, such as production, procurement, or sales, as well as identifying existing measures and defining additional measures to be implemented. The commit- ment to human rights aspects as a central selection criterion for suppliers is driven forward by our supplier management system. This obliges our partners to commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which re- quires compliance with human rights due diligence ob- ligations as defined by the German LkSG, such as the prohibition of forced labour and rules on non-discrimi- nation.\nMeasures and progress\nNon-compliance with our guidelines by employees may result in disciplinary measures up to and including dis- missal. Violations of corruption or competition laws, human rights, or contractual agreements by third par- ties may result in their exclusion from conducting busi- ness with Heidelberg Materials or require them to meet certain test conditions.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 127\n    Our SpeakUp reporting platform, helps us not only to track compliance violations, but also to improve our preventive measures. SpeakUp is publicised on the in- tranet, on the internet, and at the various locations by means of informative posters. To reinforce our efforts to combat corruption, the country organisations are working on the implementation of individual country measures that were defined as part of the corruption risk assessment. The same applies to competition law and the protection of human rights.\nIn 2022, the preventive activities of the compliance of- ficers once again placed great emphasis on compli- ance with the provisions of competition law and anti- corruption regulations. In order to implement the German LkSG, the compliance officers have intensified their cooperation with the Group department Group Procurement as part of the Responsible Procurement initiative. Other functions were made aware of their hu- man rights due diligence obligations via information events backed by appropriate training measures.\nAfter pandemic-related restrictions were lifted, more training measures could be carried out again in 2022, with virtual concepts continuing to dominate. Compli- ance audits by Group Internal Audit were carried out on-site again.\nEfforts to protect human rights at our own locations \u2013 with a focus on safe working conditions and anti- discrimination \u2013 and in the supply chain continued and were intensified by the new human rights compliance organisation described above and the Responsible Pro- curement initiative. In addition to training activities, this work included systematically assessing human rights risks on a country-by-country basis and compil- ing key indicators relating to human rights. The results were analysed jointly by the respective country organ- isation and the Group Compliance department. The implementation of the agreed action plans for further risk reduction was reviewed and reported to the re- sponsible member of the Managing Board.\nPerformance indicators\n\nAt the end of the reporting year, the compliance e-learning programmes assigned to employees across the Group, covering the Code of Business Conduct and anti-corruption issues, had completion rates of 94%10) and 95%10) respectively.\nElectronic training on antitrust law is additionally as- signed to employees who work in sales or procurement, have management responsibility, or otherwise have contact with competitors, customers, and suppliers, achieving a completion rate of 93%10) at the end of the reporting year. There were also other compliance ac- tivities in the area of antitrust law (seminars, lectures, and other measures).\nThe country organisations are required to report key figures, such as the number of compliance cases re- ported through the case management system that in- volve suspected human rights violations. Apart from cases on health and occupational safety, four cases of discrimination were reported in relation to human rights issues, one of which was confirmed, and seven cases of harassment, with four justified complaints. The con- firmed cases were responded to with sanctions and/or preventive measures.\n18\nOf the 233 incidents reported, around half proved to be unfounded, while for 20%, no final investigation result had been determined by the editorial deadline. For just under 28% of the incidents, the investigations revealed that they were at least partially substantiated. None of the substantiated incident reports had a material im- pact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFor all substantiated cases, measures were taken, ranging from root cause analysis, changes to policies and processes, and communication and training through to disciplinary action (such as a written warn- ing or dismissal). In 42% of the substantiated cases, sanctions are imposed and for 81% of these incidents, preventive measures are implemented.\n10) Since 2022, the training status of the persons to be trained at the end of the financial year has been reported over the two-year training repetition period.\n\n1. **Total Reported Incidents**: \n   - The infographic states that there were 233 incidents reported in the current year. For comparison, the previous year (2021) had 238 reported incidents, indicating a slight decrease in the number of reports.\n\n2. **Methods of Reporting**: \n   - The majority of the reports, 79%, were made through the \"SpeakUp\" compliance reporting system, which seems to be a dedicated platform for reporting compliance-related incidents within the organization.\n   - Of these reports made via the SpeakUp system:\n     - 78% were submitted online.\n     - 22% were made via telephone, highlighting a significant preference for digital reporting over phone calls.\n   - Additionally, 21% of the reports were submitted through more traditional means such as emails or letters, showing that a portion of the workforce still uses conventional communication methods for reporting.\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

Our achievements and progress in the field of sustainabil- ity are equally important. We want our building materials to be used to create intel- ligent, resilient, and sustainable buildings as well as infrastructure for tomorrow \u2013 and we want to keep the ecological footprint associated with their production as small as possible. To underline the importance of sustainability to our business success, we are publishing a combined Annual and Sustainability Report for the first time and underpin our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, whose ten princi- ples relating to human rights, labour standards, the environment, and corruption prevention serve as key guidelines for our entrepreneurial activity.\nHeidelberg Materials \u2013 our new global brand\nYou\u2019ll notice that this report also has a fresh look. In September 2022, we introduced \u201cHeidelberg Materials,\u201d our first global brand in our 150-year history, and work is now underway to gradually roll it out to all Group countries. Our new brand identity will allow us to take full advantage of our organisation\u2019s strengths and represent our positions consistently, both internally and externally. The fact that our colleagues in the Group\u2019s more than 50 countries have responded so positively to our new brand is proof of the great sense of cohesion felt by the Heidelberg Materials team world- wide, I\u2019m personally very pleased of that.\nWe continue to drive our industry\u2019s transformation\nWe have the ambition, the speed, the knowledge, the technologies, and the partners to lead the necessary process of transformation in our sector. Our focus is on ex- panding our portfolio of sustainable products, rapidly and significantly reducing our CO2 emissions, proving that the production of carbon-neutral products is possible on a large scale, and creating a circular economy by rigorously implementing the prin- ciple of circularity. Our recently tightened Sustainability Commitments 2030 under- score this ambition.\n\u201cWe must take the entire value chain into account if we\u2019re to achieve climate neutrality.\u201d\nDr Dominik von Achten\nWe continue to make good progress towards net zero. We succeeded in reducing our specific net CO2 emissions by a further 2% in the 2022 financial year. But we must take the entire value chain into account, from raw materials to reuse, if we\u2019re to achieve climate neutrality. That\u2019s why we pushed ahead our recycling activities, a particular focus of our portfolio optimisation in 2022. By acquiring recycling compa- nies in Germany, the UK, and the USA, we have taken another important step towards implementing our circular economy strategy.\nCCUS roadmap as the key to decarbonisation\nOn our journey towards climate-neutrality, CCUS \u2013 carbon capture, utilisation, and storage \u2013 is a crucial tool for us as a building materials manufacturer when it comes to dealing with the raw material-related process emissions that have been unavoid- able up to now. As early as next year, 2024, we will put the world\u2019s first industrial- scale carbon capture facility at a cement plant into operation in Brevik, Norway. This will make us a front runner in the use of this key technology for decarbonising our industry.\nWith a portfolio of nine innovative, industrial-scale CCUS projects to date, we are continuing to expand our pioneering role. In 2022, we launched our largest CCUS project so far in Mitchell, USA, which will have the capacity to capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year. In early 2023, we announced two more major CCUS projects. At our plant in Antoing, Belgium, we will build a state-of-the-art hybrid carbon capture facility that will help us to reduce our CO2 emissions by 800,000 tonnes. We\u2019re planning the same capacity at our plant in Devnya, Bulgaria. Both projects are scheduled to start in 2028.\n\nTo our stakeholders\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n(Aktiengesetz, AktG). The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that both Mr Mucic and Mr Merckle have exper- tise in the areas of accounting and auditing. For more information, see the Corporate Governance state- ment chapter.\nIn the reporting year, the Personnel Committee fo- cused on the preliminary discussion and recommenda- tion to the Supervisory Board regarding the determina- tion of the variable Managing Board remuneration for the 2021 financial year and on the definition of param- eters for the variable Managing Board remuneration in 2022 and in the years from 2022 to 2024/25, respec- tively. Finally, the Personnel Committee assured itself that all members of the Managing Board have car- ried out the required individual investment in HeidelbergCement AG shares as part of the Managing Board remuneration system.\nThe Sustainability and Innovation Committee, which was newly formed in the reporting year, received re- ports about the Sustainability Office from the Manag- ing Board and dealt with sustainability topics, in par- ticular with regard to the decarbonisation roadmap, ESG benchmarking, and the status and development of the Innovation Hub, a department within the Sustaina- bility Office that brings together and promotes innova- tive ideas.\nDue to the announced resignation from the Super- visory Board of Mr Fritz-J\u00fcrgen Heckmann and Mr Tobias Merckle, the Nomination Committee discussed the issue of succession in the reporting year. It recom- mended that the Supervisory Board propose Dr Bernd Scheifele and Dr Sopna Sury to the 2022 Annual Gen- eral Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board as successors to the two resigning shareholder represent- atives.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 15\n    The Mediation Committee, formed in accordance with section 27(3) of the German Codetermination Law (MitbestG), did not need to meet.\nThe results of the committees\u2019 meetings were reported at the subsequent plenary sessions.\nDuring the reporting year, there were no potential con- flicts of interest of any Managing Board or Supervisory Board member that would have had to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board without undue delay. There were also no consulting or other contracts for services or work between any member of the Supervisory Board and the company in the 2022 reporting year.\nIn the reporting period, there were no transactions with related parties requiring disclosure within the meaning of sections 111a(1)(2) and 111b(1) of the AktG.\nCorporate Governance\nThe declaration of compliance in the reporting year was submitted by the Supervisory Board on 31 January 2022 and by the Managing Board on 11 February 2022. The declaration of compliance for the current year was submitted by the Managing Board on 13 January 2023 and by the Supervisory Board on 30 January 2023. The complete text can be found in the Declaration of com- pliance section pursuant to section 161 of the AktG in the Corporate Governance statement chapter. The current declaration of compliance is made permanent- ly available on the company\u2019s website.\nWith regard to its composition and that of the Manag- ing Board, the Supervisory Board thoroughly complies with the guidelines of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code regarding the principles of diversity when appointing corporate bodies and leadership positions within the Group and of section 289f(2)(6) of the Ger- man Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) (diversity concept). Regarding its own composition, it\nimplements the diversity targets stated in the Code and the profile of skills for the Supervisory Board agreed on 11 September 2017. Detailed information on this topic can be found in the Corporate Governance statement chapter.\nIn March 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to set the target figure for the proportion of women on the Managing Board to at least one woman for the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025. With Dr Nicola Kimm as a member of the Managing Board since 1 September 2021, this target was achieved ahead of schedule. The Supervisory Board also welcomes and supports the Managing Board\u2019s target of further increasing the pro- portion of women in management positions in the first and second leadership levels below the Managing Board. For details, please refer to the Corporate Gov- ernance statement chapter.\nWith regard to the remuneration for the members of the Managing Board for the 2022 financial year, specif- ics are included in the Remuneration report chapter to avoid repetition. A description of the adjusted ver- sion of the Managing Board remuneration system, ap- plicable from 1 January 2021, can also be found here. Having been commissioned to do so by the company, the auditor also carried out the voluntary audit of the correctness of the content of the 2022 remuneration report and issued an unqualified audit opinion. The Su- pervisory Board examined the remuneration report in detail in the presence of the auditor and approved the report together with the Managing Board. The 2022 remuneration report will be submitted to the 2023 An- nual General Meeting for approval and will be available on the company\u2019s website for ten years.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are themselves responsible for obtaining the training required for their tasks and are supported by the company in this respect. The company also offers specific training sessions \u2013\n             \nTo our stakeholders\nReport of the Supervisory Board\nsometimes with external support \u2013 for members of the Supervisory Board, most recently in November 2022. These training courses cover topics that are particular- ly relevant to the company and the work of the Super- visory Board \u2013 for example, with regard to legal chang- es, the selection of suitable investment projects, the ongoing development of the company\u2019s antitrust law compliance system, the company\u2019s risk management system, the implementation of EU taxonomy, and the changes to the German Corporate Governance Code. If required, new members of the Supervisory Board are given an introduction to the legal framework surround- ing the Supervisory Board and can also meet with members of the Managing Board and line managers to discuss fundamental and current issues in order to gain an overview of the topics that are relevant to the com- pany. New Supervisory Board members also receive comprehensive information about the corporate gov- ernance of the company as well as insider law process- es and obligations.\nIn addition, the Managing Board reports on corporate governance at Heidelberg Materials also for the Super- visory Board in the Corporate Governance statement chapter.\nWith the statements listed above, the Supervisory Board has reaffirmed its commitment to effective cor- porate governance in the Group.\nAuditing and approval of annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements, and non-financial statement\nBefore the contract for the auditing of the annual finan- cial statements of the company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group was awarded, the points of focus for the audit and the content of the audit were discussed in detail with the auditor, Price- waterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesell- schaft, Frankfurt am Main. The Audit Committee dis-\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 16\n    cussed the costs of the audit and with the auditor the assessment of audit risk, the audit strategy, audit plan- ning, and the audit results with the auditor. The Chair- man of the Audit Committee and the auditor regularly exchanged information on the progress of the audit, after which the Chairman reported to the committee.\nIn January 2023, the Managing Board informed the Supervisory Board about the preliminary, unaudited key figures for the 2022 financial year and provided a status report on the financial statements work. The an- nual financial statements of HeidelbergCement AG, the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, and the combined management report for the company and the Group, as prepared by the Managing Board, were examined by the auditor. In addition, the auditor performed a limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement (sections 289b and 315b of the HGB) contained in the combined management re- port on behalf of the Supervisory Board. The financial statements together with the reading copies of the au- ditors\u2019 reports were sent in advance to the members of the Supervisory Board. At first, the Audit Committee dealt intensively with the financial statements docu- ments (including the non-financial statement) in the presence of the auditor. The auditor reported on the main results of its audit. In addition, the Audit Commit- tee had the auditor report on the effectiveness of the internal control and early risk identification system in relation to accounting, whereby the auditor stated that he had not found any significant weaknesses in this re- gard. Against this background and after its own con- sideration, the Audit Committee determined that the internal control system, the internal audit system, and the risk management system, including the early risk identification system, meet the requirements to be placed on them. The Supervisory Board shares the opinion of the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of these systems. Then, the Supervisory Board discussed the financial statement documents (including the\nnon-financial statement) in detail, once again in the presence of the auditor. Respective discussions in the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board also took place without the participation of the Managing Board. The Supervisory Board approved the audit results. It examined the annual financial statements and consol- idated financial statements, the combined manage- ment report (including the non-financial statement), and the Managing Board\u2019s proposal for the use of the balance sheet profit. The results of the pre-audit con- ducted by the Audit Committee and the results of its own audit correspond fully to the results of the auditor. The Supervisory Board raised no objections to the final results of this examination. The auditor issued an un- qualified audit opinion on the annual financial state- ments of HeidelbergCement AG and the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022 as well as the combined management report of HeidelbergCement AG and the Group.\nThe Supervisory Board approved the Managing Board\u2019s proposal for the use of the balance sheet profit, includ- ing the payout of a dividend of \u20ac2.60 per share (previ- ous year: \u20ac2.40).\n  \n\nSustainability\nCompliance\nCompliance\nCompliance is a vital element of our corporate values. The public image of Heidelberg Materials is shaped by the conduct of each and every employee. We respect the cultures and laws of the countries in which we operate as well as the local people and institutions. With our Code of Business Conduct, we have introduced a Group-wide set of rules to which all of us are com- mitted.\nCompliant behaviour is at the heart of our business activities\nWe can only achieve success by working as a team \u2013 and compliance is no exception. In turn, this means that compliance work itself must be clearly defined by rules and widely communicated. This is the role of our compliance management system. In addition to over- seeing the system, the Managing Board takes the lead when it comes to reminding the workforce of their com- pliance obligations.\nCompliant behaviour is also integral to our business model. Our production and extraction sites are gener- ally designed for a service life of several decades. To maintain operating permits at our locations over these long periods and to renew our mining concessions at the required intervals, we need the constant support of the public and must prove our integrity time and time again.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 28\n    Our compliance management system\nOur compliance management system consists of seven elements, which are also laid down in the auditing standard 980 issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer in Deutsch- land e.V., IDW).\n\u2013 Our compliance culture is documented in our Code of Business Conduct.\n\u2013 Our Code of Business Conduct and other compliance guidelines also define clear compliance targets.\n\u2013 We generally carry out compliance risk assess- ments to help guide our compliance work, but also to specifically address the topics of anti-corruption and human rights.\n\u2013 Our compliance programme includes, in particular, guidelines, a whistle-blower system and case man- agement, sanctions screening, and reviews of busi- ness partners.\n\u2013 The compliance organisation clearly defines re- sponsibilities and ensures complete coverage of all compliance topics.\n\u2013 Compliance communications include web-based and face-to-face training, videos, posters, online in- formation, compliance letters, and other media use.\n\u2013 Regular compliance checks are primarily carried out by Group Internal Audit.\nWe regularly make our employees aware of compliance matters. The topic is firmly integrated into all work processes through training opportunities and practical application on a daily basis. If there is no specific guide- line on how to act in a particular situation, the compli- ance team can be consulted to give recommendations in line with our ethical standards and our Code of Busi- ness Conduct. We carry out our responsibilities towards customers, suppliers, official bodies, and business partners with honesty, integrity, and professionalism.\nWe believe that adhering to the principles of our Code of Business Conduct ensures the business success of Heidelberg Materials, creates a working environment built on trust, and leads to higher levels of satisfaction among all of our company\u2019s stakeholders. Non-financial statement\n\n\nSustainability\nOur employees\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 56\n    trend through active generation management and by offering numerous health management and preventive care measures adapted to regional requirements.\nFlexible working time models, a digital workplace, and mobile working have become the norm for us in our commitment to work-life balance. This offering is com- plemented by virtual workshops and preventive screen- ing, covering many different health topics, as part of our health management activities. The sports groups, courses, and our own gym at our headquarters support mental and physical health. To promote sustainable and flexible mobility, we also subsidise offers such as the JobTicket public transport and JobRad bike leasing schemes.\nThrough trainee programmes, dual apprenticeship and study partnerships, specialist and managerial develop- ment, and professional training, we invest specifically in the best possible qualification of our employees. With our e-campus and the possibility of international work assignments, we can also hold our own in the global labour market.\nRemuneration policy and working time regulation\nThe remuneration systems at Heidelberg Materials are based on performance and results in accordance with the market standards for internationally operating companies in our sector. Alongside fixed remuneration governed by a collective agreement or an individual work contract, our employees also receive variable re- muneration elements based on their individual perfor- mance and on corporate success. Our CO2 reduction\ntargets are consistently anchored in our global remu- neration systems as well: the full variable remuneration can only be achieved if both the financial targets and the sustainability target are met. This regulation has applied to all members of the Managing Board and to every bonus-eligible employee worldwide since the start of the 2021 financial year.\nWe consciously aim to achieve a high variable element as part of the total remuneration of our managers in order to directly reflect the connection between per- sonal performance and corporate success.\nCollective regulations apply to more than half of the Group\u2019s employees. The employees in our foreign sub- sidiaries benefit otherwise from attractive remunera- tion systems that correspond to the respective local market conditions.\nOur working time regulations comply with the legal re- quirements in effect at our respective locations. We promote adherence to these regulations by means of our whistle-blower system, which employees can use to individually report possible violations (passive monitor- ing). To enable flexible working time options, we offer models such as flexitime, working time accounts, part- time work, and leaves of absence, for example in the form of a sabbatical, to our employees in many coun- tries. Older employees also have the option of switch- ing to partial retirement.\nEmployment and co-determination\nEmployee co-determination has always been of great importance to us. Statutory, collective bargaining, and company regulations are implemented jointly in close cooperation with employee representatives. The works council and Group management work together in a spirit of trust.\nIn accordance with the defined co-determination and participation rights, the relevant committees are in- formed in good time so that opinions can be obtained, and then agreements are made with them. Heidelberg Materials works consistently and intensively with em- ployee representatives in a spirit of trust. These repre- sentatives are involved in numerous committees and are informed at an early stage about operational changes. In the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation to achieve a socially re- sponsible solution and, for example, initially examine the possibility of transferring employees within the Group. If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the indi- vidual impact through retraining, early-retirement schemes, outplacement, and severance payments. Non-financial statement\n \nSustainability\nOur employees\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 58\n    Education\nFor Heidelberg Materials, forward-looking HR manage- ment means consistently investing in training. With an apprentice retention rate of 85% in Germany, steady growth of qualified young talent is guaranteed.\nIn addition to technical skills for ensuring functionally sound processes, digital competences have also be- come indispensable. We already cover the technical part with virtual learning platforms and multilingual e-learning courses, specifically developed by the Ger- man Cement Works Association (VDZ). A complete ed- ucational offering is ensured through additional train- ing covering professional use of programmes for virtual communication and cooperation, how to deal personally with the new work and life situation, and topics of mental health and resilience.\nAs a manufacturing Group, occupational safety is al- ways a key element of our training and career develop- ment programmes. In addition, we focus our efforts on specialist training and the training of our managers. Our training programmes in virtually every work area are characterised by practical and business-oriented learning and enable our employees to develop their skills in the best possible way.\nThe Cement Academy of the Competence Center Cement (CCC) offers seminars and training sessions around the world for the engineers and technicians at our cement plants, while the Aggregates Academy of the Competence Center Aggregates & Asphalt (CCA) provides apprenticeships and employee training in the aggregates business line. Process simulators and various web-based learning programmes, including the\nmultilingual Cement Manufacturing Curriculum, on which more than 3,000 employees are enrolled, are regularly used to supplement our classroom courses.\nStrengthening digital competences\nThere is undeniably a need to build and expand digital competences, drive change processes in the context of digital transformation, and further digitalise personnel processes and systems. Our efforts are focused on fundamental digital media skills as well as topics relat- ed to specific functions. To increase the transparency of our digital activities for employees, all key global digitalisation projects and the tools used within the Group are explained on a platform to which all employ- ees have access. We used external training databases to also significantly expand e-learning offerings on var- ious digitalisation topics in the past year.\nTraining on the use of virtual communication and col- laboration tools also accounted for a large part of de- mand in the past year. To meet this demand, we offer both in-house courses and comprehensive digital train- ing and certification from external partners (Microsoft certification tracks).\nSuccessor planning\nSecuring and developing junior executives is an impor- tant pillar of our personnel development strategy. We have intensified our activities aimed at expanding our development programmes and strengthening our re- cruitment of university graduates worldwide. We offer them extensive, international trainee programmes fo- cusing on the areas of technology, sales, finance, HR, and procurement, as well as interdisciplinary posts.\nThrough a special programme, we also equip highly qualified engineers in the cement business for senior engineering positions. The participants undergo indi- vidually tailored training programmes that allow them to gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to prepare them for the next stage of their career. Spending time at cement plants in different countries is a key element of the programme\u2019s success.\nSince 2013, Heidelberg Materials has been the proud recipient of the trainee seal of the German initiative for career-enhancing and fair trainee programmes each year for our programmes for the advancement of future executives. As a member of the Fair Company initiative and bearer of the Fair Company seal, we have also been voluntarily committed to the creation of fair and attractive working conditions for trainees and young professionals. Non-financial statement\n \n\nWe work hard to minimise and prevent risks for our em- ployees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties. To this end, we carry out regular risk assessments at our locations so that we can evaluate risks and take appropriate protective measures. Based on the results of these risk assessments, we have introduced and continuously updated various Group-wide safety standards in recent years in order to address activities with particularly high risks consistently. These stand- ards are translated into local measures at our locations and, if necessary, supplemented by additional meas- ures. As part of workplace inspections, we check com- pliance with these internal standards as well as with other legally mandated external requirements. Any shortcomings we identify are rectified as quickly as possible.\nAll our measures give due consideration not only to our own employees but also to the employees of external companies. They work for us in areas such as produc- tion, maintenance and repair, transport, other services, and consulting. We have therefore addressed the issue of contractor safety with a separate Group standard to take account of the particular requirements placed on external companies as well as those that must be met by Heidelberg Materials when engaging external companies.\nTransport is another important focus of our work, as traffic accidents have unfortunately repeatedly led to uninvolved third parties sustaining injuries or even los- ing their lives. We address this issue in training courses for our own drivers and those who drive on our behalf. The driver training courses aim to raise drivers\u2019 safety\nawareness so that they can identify and reduce poten- tial risks at an early stage. This training in defensive driving is not only theory based; it is also increasingly delivered using driving simulators, at driving safety centers, or through supervised driving. In addition, we are making greater use of technical aids. As well as fitting vehicles with various assistance systems and using such systems, examples of this approach also include checking the roadworthiness of third-party vehicles before loading.\nImproving mental health\nIn addition to the measures outlined above for the pre- vention of accidents and standard occupational dis- eases, various Group countries are also increasingly working with external organisations in order to improve the mental health of employees. The idea is to raise awareness of mental health problems and train em- ployees to recognise warning signs and offer support. The aim of the measures is to dispel prejudices and encourage those affected to talk about their problems and seek help.\nIn recognition of the sensitivity of the topic and to make it easier for those affected to access appropriate services, many of our subsidiaries offer external sup- port programmes that provide help anonymously and free of charge. Countries in which such programmes are available include Germany, the UK, Belgium, Canada, the USA, and Australia.\nNon-financial statement\n \n\n    As a global Group with a strong regional business fo- cus, we operate at many locations across the world. Our production and quarrying sites are generally de- signed for a service life of several decades. To maintain acceptance of our business activities at the sites over these long periods, we are active in the communities close to our plants and fulfil our corporate social re- sponsibility (CSR). We create jobs and promote local economic development with our wages, investment, purchasing, and taxes, particularly in economically weak regions.\nSocial engagement at our locations\nWe have made a commitment to social responsibility in our Code of Business Conduct. At our locations, we strive for a constructive, trusting, and neighbourly re- lationship with local residents. We support the social and economic development of our neighbouring com- munities and foster transparent communication with all stakeholders. We aim to work with local partners to create added value both for our Group and for the local communities. People in the communities where we op- erate also expect us to contribute to the areas sur- rounding our production sites by regularly providing information about our business activities and through our commitment to local social, economic, and environ- mental development. Taking social responsibility and\nmaintaining good relationships with our stakeholders \u2013 particularly at our production sites \u2013 are management tasks. The national management team, together with the national CSR manager, is responsible for social en- gagement in each country. Funding decisions for indi- vidual countries are made by the national management teams within their budgetary framework. Together with the location representatives, they are also responsible for analysing local needs and for selecting, implement- ing, and monitoring projects.\nInvolving local communities\nWe involve local communities in our business activities through various dialogue formats as well as communi- ty engagement plans. Among other things, these strat- egies include long-term partnerships with non-govern- mental and non-profit organisations. In addition, we keep the local communities and stakeholders informed via newsletters or at open days.\nWe have also defined clear evaluation criteria to ensure that our activities are both transparent and effective. We support projects, initiatives, and organisations that are active at our locations or to which we have a direct link. We attach great importance to ensuring that the guidelines and principles of these organisations align with our own corporate philosophy.\nOur engagement is focused on the following areas:\n\u2013 Culture: we promote cultural initiatives for all age groups in our local communities.\n\u2013 Environment: we support initiatives that promote environmental protection and strengthen the diver- sity of nature at our locations.\n\u2013 Infrastructure: we provide practical help in the con- struction of buildings and infrastructure by making products, financial means, and expertise available.\n\u2013 Education: in this area, we are guided by the specif- ic needs of our locations. We foster potential and encourage initiatives such as education partner- ships.\nFocus of our engagement in 2022\nAt Heidelberg Materials, we stepped up our humanitar- ian efforts in 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. The country organisation in Poland, for example, took direct action and made the conference center on site available to host refugees. In addition to nu- merous other initiatives there, financial aid was provid- ed for Ukrainian students at the University of Opole, a charity run was organised, and deliveries of relief sup- plies to Ukraine were supported. In Germany, too, one of our buildings was made available to host refugees and a fundraising campaign was organised among employees.\n\nCombined management report\nFundamentals of the Group\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 business model encompasses the entire value chain, from the extraction of raw ma- terials to further processing into cement through to the end product, concrete and its recycling.\nHeidelberg Materials operates as a fully integrated building materials company. Key business processes include the extraction of raw materials, the production of building materials, as well as their sales and distri- bution to customers. Operating activities are support- ed by central competence centers for technology as well as by shared service centers in individual countries and regions. Operating business processes include the geological exploration of raw material deposits, the purchase or lease of the land where the deposits are located, applying for mining concessions and environ- mental impact assessments, the construction of man- ufacturing facilities in cooperation with external service providers, as well as the actual production of building materials, including extracting raw materials, process- ing and recycling building materials, and maintenance of the facilities.\nProducts\nOur core products cement, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt are homogeneous bulk goods. Their product characteristics are mostly standardised in order to ensure the required stability, reliability, and processability in the application.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 67\n    Cements are classified according to their early and final strength as well as their composition. In addition to cements that consist of almost 100% clinker, there are so-called composite cements, in which a portion of the clinker is replaced by alternative raw materials, such as fly ash, ground slag, or limestone. Cement is used as a binder mainly in concrete production.\nAggregates (sand, gravel, and crushed rock) are clas- sified according to their particle size and texture. They are the main component in the production of concrete and asphalt but are also used as base courses in the construction of infrastructure, such as roads.\nConcrete is a mixture of aggregates (about 80%), cement (about 12%), and water. Concrete is usually delivered to the construction site by ready-mix trucks and is poured locally into forms. Moreover, concrete is also used for the production of precast concrete parts, such as stairs, ceiling elements, or structural compo- nents.\nAsphalt is a mixture of aggregates (about 95%) and bitumen and is generally used as a top layer in road construction.\nLocations and sales markets\nDue to the heavy weight of cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete in proportion to their price, pro- duction is usually located in close proximity to the sales markets. The cement transportation radius by road normally does not exceed 200 km. The delivery radius for aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt by road is generally less than 100 km. Consequently, we have local production sites in more than 50 countries in which we offer building materials.\nWe operate around 130 cement plants (plus a further 20 as part of joint ventures), just under 600 quarries and aggregates pits, as well as around 1,320 ready- mixed concrete production sites worldwide. In total, the Group employs 50,780 people at around 2,500 loca- tions on five continents. There are additionally more than 350 production sites belonging to joint ventures.\nOrganisational structure\nThe Group is divided into five geographical Group areas: Western and Southern Europe, Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia, North America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin. Our global trading activities, especially the trading of cement and clinker, are pooled together in the sixth Group area, Group Services.\nWithin the geographical Group areas, we have divided our activities into four business lines. The cement and aggregates business lines comprise the essential raw materials that are required for the manufacture of the downstream products ready-mixed concrete and as- phalt, which are combined in our third business line. The fourth business line, service-joint ventures-other, pri- marily covers the activities of our joint ventures.\n\n\nCountries/locations\nImportance of sustainability to the business model\nWe want to significantly reduce the impact of our busi- ness activities on the climate and lower our carbon footprint. As a leading building materials manufacturer, we see it as our responsibility to play a decisive role in transforming our industry to meet current and future needs. We want to make a substantial contribution to sustainable construction and carbon neutrality and assume social and environmental responsibility.\nClimate protection is an integral part of the Group strategy. The production of cement generates a large amount of CO2 due to the chemical processes involved in burning clinker and the high temperatures this re- quires. Therefore, we are making greater use of alter- native raw materials and fuels to reduce CO2 emissions. We also optimise our production processes to increase energy efficiency. To reduce the consumption of pri- mary raw materials, we are committed to circularity and strengthening the circular economy. At product level, our focus is on the broad introduction of low-car- bon cements and concretes, the use of recycled mate-\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nInformation according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system that translates the EU\u2019s climate and environmental ob- jectives into criteria for certain environmentally sus- tainable economic activities for investment purposes. Economic activities are recognised as \u201cenvironmental- ly sustainable\u201d if they make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives while not significantly harming any of the other defined environmental objectives. In addition, minimum social standards must be met.\nAssessment of taxonomy eligibility\nThe portfolio of our business activities was assessed in the reporting year with regard to taxonomy eligibility under the delegated acts on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition to 3.7 Manufacture of ce- ment (represented in the following as the cement busi- ness line), 5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste (represented in the following as the recycled ag- gregates operating line within the aggregates business line) has been identified as a relevant economic activi- ty (see Circular economy section) and included in the reporting pursuant to the requirements of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. There are also other tax- onomy-eligible economic activities within Heidelberg Materials\u2019 business lines, such as transport services, which are, however, not shown separately and are in- cluded in the reporting for the cement business line and activity 3.7.\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 other business activities, such as the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line, are taxonomy-non-eligible under the currently known legal acts. We also analysed cross-sectional economic ac- tivities for the CapEx and OpEx KPIs, but this did not result in any additional reportable activities.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 114\n    Review of the technical screening criteria\nThe technical screening criteria for taxonomy align- ment with the act on climate change mitigation were reviewed by an interdisciplinary working group and with the involvement of further experts, especially with re- gard to the interpretation of the \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d (DNSH) criteria. The requirements of the climate change adaptation act were not pursued further, as we are currently unable to achieve taxonomy-aligned rev- enue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure in accordance with the regulation.\nTo review the criteria determining whether a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (substantial contribution criteria) is made, internal reporting sys- tems and data were used to verify compliance with the respective limit values at plant level. The analysis dif- ferentiates between the various types of plants (inte- grated plants, clinker plants, grinding plants) on the basis of the reporting definitions set out by the GCCA industry association.\nFor the somewhat more qualitative DNSH criteria, the individual (legal) requirements and their applicability to Heidelberg Materials were reviewed and potential ap- proaches for proving the alignment of the individual plants were devised. For example, a location-based assessment for climate change adaptation was devel- oped, covering various climate scenarios and time ho- rizons. If risks are identified, the plants will be expected to implement appropriate adaptation measures. At the same time, for criteria such as \u201cprotection and resto- ration of biodiversity and ecosystems\u201d or \u201csustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\u201d use is made of existing processes. We regularly assess the proximity of our operational sites to protected areas and, if necessary, develop biodiversity management plans. For the \u201csustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\u201d criterion, we have extended our existing approach of creating water management\nplans and make use of the assessment of (potential) risks and impacts carried out for this purpose.\nFor the manufacture of cement and the \u201cpollution pre- vention and control\u201d criterion, we use, among other things, our long-established processes for monitoring air pollutants to verify compliance. We have also exam- ined the additional requirements for the products we manufacture, such as those relating to placing hazard- ous substances on the market. We come to the conclu- sion that these criteria are fulfilled. With respect to circular economy, there are no requirements within the Taxonomy Regulation for 3.7 Manufacture of cement and 5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste.\nIn order to comply with the minimum safeguards, we have closely coordinated with the Group Legal and Compliance department and compared our existing measures on human rights, anti-corruption, fair com- petition, and taxation with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. As we have been implementing compliance processes in these areas for many years and are continuously reviewing and expanding them, we have come to the conclusion that the minimum safeguards are being met. One current example of our continuous optimisation efforts, is our work in the field of human rights to further expand our analysis of sig- nificant risks and their impact on potentially affected parties. Particularly with respect to our supply chains, we have supplemented our existing risk management with suitable processes (in the context of the require- ments of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), among other things). Further information on this topic can be found in the Compliance section.\nExplanation of the key figures\nThe key figures revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) relevant to the Tax- onomy Regulation were determined with reference to the definitions set out in the Annex to the Delegated\n  \n\nThe image is a detailed infographic illustrating various sustainability commitments and demographic data for an organization. The infographic is structured around commitments for a \"safe and inclusive future\" and includes statistics on leadership, training, and workforce demographics. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Sustainability Commitments\n1. **25% of Leadership Positions Filled by Women**: This commitment indicates the organization's goal to enhance gender diversity in leadership roles.\n2. **100% of Sites to Have Community Engagement Plans by 2030**: This commitment shows the organization\u2019s dedication to being actively involved in community engagement across all its locations by the year 2030.\n3. **50% Reduction in LTIFR (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) Compared with 2020**: The organization aims to halve its rate of workplace injuries that result in time lost from work, compared to the year 2020, and aims for zero fatalities.\n4. **1 Day of Paid Leave for Voluntary Community Work Per Year**: This policy offers all employees one day of paid leave annually to engage in voluntary community service.\n\n### Workforce Demographics\n1. **Age Structure within the Group**:\n   - **Under 30 Years**: 11% of the workforce\n   - **30-49 Years**: 51% of the workforce\n   - **50+ Years**: 38% of the workforce\n   These statistics provide insight into the age distribution of the organization's employees, indicating a mature workforce with the majority being between 30 and 49 years old.\n\n2. **14% Share of Female Executives**: This data point details the percentage of female employees holding executive roles with leadership responsibilities (referred to as N-1 and N-2 levels).\n\n### Training Hours\n- **28 Hours Per Employee**: The infographic also breaks down the average training hours per employee:\n   - **Occupational Safety Training**: 55%\n   - **Specialist Training**: 30%\n   - **Other**: 5%\n   - **Soft Skills Training**: 4%\n   - **Management Training**: 4%\n   - **Language Courses**: 2%\n   This indicates the organization\u2019s focus on continuous learning and development, with a significant emphasis on occupational safety and specialist training.\n\nOverall, the infographic effectively communicates the organization\u2019s key sustainability initiatives and workforce demographics, highlighting its commitment to safety, community engagement, and diversity. The distribution of training topics underscores a robust approach to professional development, ensuring employees are well-equipped for their roles.\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nResponsibility towards our employees Employees\nHeidelberg Materials has around 51,000 employees worldwide. We want to offer attractive working condi- tions and jobs with a secure future. For us, a good per- sonnel policy means respecting our employees with their range of talents, qualities, and diversity of expe- rience as well as creating the right conditions to allow them to do their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As a manufacturing company, we also attach importance to occupational safety and the protection of our em- ployees\u2019 health.\nAt the end of 2022, the number of employees at Heidelberg Materials stood at 50,780 (previous year: 51,209), based on full-time equivalents. The decrease of around 430 employees essentially results from two opposing developments. On the one hand, around 1,200 jobs were cut across the Group as a result of portfolio optimisation measures, the realisation of synergies, efficiency gains in sales and administration, as well as location optimisations. On the other hand, around 770 new employees joined the Group, among others in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Information on the number of employees in the Group areas can be found in the segment reporting.\nIn the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation with employee representatives to achieve a socially responsible solution. For example, we initially examine the possibility of transferring em- ployees within the Group. If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the individual impact through retraining, early-retirement schemes, outplacement, and sever- ance payments.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 120\n    Diversity, equity, and inclusion\nGroup-wide, we aim for a mix of diverse nationalities, personalities, skills, and experience. We see the diver- sity in our workforce in terms of cultural and ethnic or- igin, gender, age, mental and physical abilities, and sexual orientation and identity as an asset to our glob- al teams. We are convinced that this diversity, in har- mony with an appreciative corporate culture, has a positive effect on our innovative strength and the com- mitment of our employees.\nThe international composition of our top and senior management also gives us the benefit of a broad range of experience from different cultural backgrounds. This allows us to respond flexibly and quickly to global chal- lenges as well as local market needs. The proportion of local managers at the upper management level amounts to around 80%.\nAt our headquarters, we aim to ensure that the work- force is composed of employees from the countries in which we operate, with the intention of improving cooperation with local personnel. Currently, more than 50 different nationalities are represented at our head- quarters.\nThere are trade unions and similar organisations in nearly all of the countries in which Heidelberg Materials operates. We also engage in regular, open dialogue with representatives of these organisations.\nTargets and commitments\nOur aim is to attract and develop highly qualified and committed employees worldwide who bring their indi- vidual skills and different perspectives to our company and thus contribute to our business success.\nIn 2022, we defined a new, ambitious target for the proportion of women at management level. In Germa- ny, we want the proportion of women in the first and second leadership levels below the Managing Board to reach 27% on each level by 2027. Our global target is for women to occupy 25% of management positions by 2030.\nWe have been signatories to the Diversity Charter since early 2013.\nResponsibility and organisation\nThe Group Human Resources (HR) department is sub- ordinate to the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the Director Group Human Resources reports directly. Group HR is also responsible for the topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Each country has its own personnel organisation and sets country-specific human resources priorities. The individual HR directors of the countries report directly to the general manager of the respective country and, in a functional reporting line, to the Group Human Resources department.\nMembers of the employee committees at the individu- al locations form the General Works Council for HeidelbergCement AG and the Group Works Council. The representative body for severely disabled employ- ees is embedded in the local works council for the headquarters in Heidelberg.\nPolicies\nHeidelberg Materials is committed to upholding the core labour standards of the International Labour Or- ganization (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights developed by the United Nations. More- over, we have enshrined this commitment in our Lead- ership Principles. We expect our employees worldwide\n\nto comply with these central guidelines and recommen- dations.\nOur Code of Business Conduct is binding across the Group and describes our values as well as our ethical and legal standards. These include non-discriminatory employment conditions and an open and fair dialogue with employee representatives.\nWith the Company Agreement on Mobile Working in Germany, we are placing particular emphasis on mak- ing our working time models more flexible in order to help our employees achieve a better work-life balance.\nWe have defined guidelines within the Group that concern, for example, respectful behaviour towards co-workers, the involvement and development of em- ployees, a commitment to a strong feedback culture, and the importance of our customers to our corporate success. We urge our managers and employees world- wide to adapt the way they behave towards one anoth- er accordingly, taking local circumstances into ac- count.\nProcesses\nEmployee and employer representatives maintain a close and regular dialogue. For instance, monthly meetings take place between Human Resources repre- sentatives and the works councils at the various loca- tions. Furthermore, the works council organises quar- terly staff meetings at the headquarters, which are attended by the Chairman of the Managing Board and the Director Group Human Resources every six months. A meeting of the General Works Council is held once a year, to which the Chairman of the Managing Board, the Managing Director of the German organisation, the Director Group Human Resources, and the Director HR for Germany are invited. In addition, the works council has formed various committees which liaise with the Group Human Resources department as required.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 121\n    Examples include the Personnel Planning Committee, data protection, IT systems, and monthly meetings with the works council at headquarters. Group man- agement and employee representatives also engage in an established, constructive dialogue in the European Works Council.\nHuman resources issues are considered at Managing Board meetings to which the Director Group Human Resources is invited depending on the topic. The Super- visory Board meets at specified intervals to discuss personnel issues related to the Managing Board.\nWe have embedded key leadership principles in stand- ard human resources processes. In annual salary re- view processes, we ensure that the remuneration of our managers and employees not covered by collective agreements develops appropriately for each individu- al. As part of a structured target agreement process, managers and employees jointly define the forthcom- ing tasks and expectations. Individual performance appraisals also have an impact on remuneration. A fur- ther purpose of career development discussions is to support our employees\u2019 development and career planning. These processes have been automated for 11 years through our HR Globe HR system and offer self-service features for employees and managers. A total of around 10,000 employees worldwide are reg- istered in the system. Over 35,000 employees have access to e-campus, our current learning management system, in which we offer training activities on special- ist and general work-related topics. We began working on the introduction of our new Workday HR system in a Group-wide project in 2021 with the intention of establishing it as the Group\u2019s central HR IT system worldwide.\nWorkday will gradually replace systems such as e-cam- pus and HR Globe. We laid the foundation with the global roll-out of Workday in December 2022. More than 45,000 employees are monitored with their HR master data in the system. The roll-out of further mod- ules is planned for 2023, including processes relating to talent management.\nMeasures and progress\nIn recent years, we have further developed our meas- ures aimed at promoting women. The proportion of women in programmes for the advancement of future executives across Germany was 31% (previous year: 31%) and therefore, as in previous years, significantly higher than the proportion of women in the total work- force in Germany of 16.9% (previous year: 15.9%). We also provide targeted support for the career develop- ment of our female future executives. In Germany, for example, we participate in a cross-company mentoring programme in cooperation with other companies from the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, where our head- quarters is located.\nThe global NOW \u2013 Network of Women, which was launched at Heidelberg Materials in 2011, connects female employees around the world virtually and in person and supports individual career development as well as promoting women in general. The initiative aims, among other things, to support the network\u2019s mem- bers in developing their career potential and to build greater awareness throughout the company of the changing demands on working and living environments. The Allies of NOW programme, introduced in 2021, also offers opportunities for male employees to advocate for gender equality at Heidelberg Materials.\nAs in previous years, Heidelberg Materials took part in activities for German Diversity Day in 2022.\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nThe steps taken in previous years regarding travel re- strictions and protective measures taken at individual locations in response to the coronavirus pandemic were adapted in the reporting year to the relevant local infection situations and regulations. Although many measures have been lifted altogether, some remain in many places because they have proven effective as preventive measures against other infectious diseases, such as flu. These include the increased provision of disinfectants, the installation of physical partitions, and more virtual meetings.\nIn 2022, we continued training our employees on a range of occupational safety topics, including both legally mandated and internally defined topics relating to key hazards that are relevant locally and across the Group. By doing so, we aim to increase awareness of risks and further reduce the number of accidents, es- pecially those resulting in fatalities.\nWe make use of conventional training in classrooms or on site in addition to e-learning courses, which are only ever used to supplement face-to-face training. Occu- pational safety topics account for around 55% of all training hours at Heidelberg Materials, corresponding to an average of approximately 15 hours per employee across the Group.\nIn addition to the conventional training activities, safe- ty conversations also play a central role as a preventive measure against accidents. During these conversa- tions between managers and employees, both safe and unsafe behaviour in the relevant situation are dis- cussed and, if necessary, safer procedures are agreed. In 2022, we asked managers to place a strong focus on conducting last-minute risk assessments in their safety conversations. Our analyses of the causes of accidents show that some accidents could have been prevented if an additional short risk assessment had been performed immediately before the work was car-\nHeidelberg Materials\n2022 124\n    ried out, i.e. at the last minute, taking into account fac- tors such as the current weather conditions or the health of the employees. By focusing more on this is- sue, we want to build greater awareness of this impor- tant preventive step on the part of both management and employees. We record the results of the safety conversations in HC Protect so that, for example, we can detect local pockets of unsafe behaviour. By carry- ing out regular safety inspections, we want to contrib- ute towards compliance with the defined safety re- quirements.\nPerformance indicators\nLost time injury frequency rate increased slightly in the reporting year to 1.7 (previous year: 1.6). The lost time injury severity rate, on the other hand, decreased sig- nificantly from 95 to 79. This development shows that on average we had fewer serious accidents with long periods of absence. The increased focus on conducting \u201clast minute\u201d risk assessments as a preventive measure is likely to have had a positive impact here. In the busi- ness year 2022, we had to mourn the death of one of our own employees and four employees of contractors lost their lives. In four cases, the accidents occurred during work to remedy unexpected disruptions in the operating process, and in another case there was a traffic accident in the quarry.\n\nAs a global Group, Heidelberg Materials is subject to a variety of legal requirements, which vary from country to country. In order to take account of these differenc- es and ensure corporate governance, we have imple- mented a compliance management system across the Group. Within this framework, we carry out compliance risk assessments every four years, most recently in 2020, and determine areas of focus for the content of the compliance programme. This is done by conducting structured interviews with the general managers of the country organisations and the Group directors. Com- pliance risk areas are identified and ranked. The risks in the topic areas of corruption, competition law, and human rights are among the ten most important risks that we mitigate by means of our compliance manage- ment system.\nCorruption topic area\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 business activity involves signif- icant cash flows, particularly in sales, procurement, financing, and investments, providing opportunities for corruption to occur in all countries of the world. Ac- cording to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index, many of the countries in which\n\nWe apply a zero tolerance policy to violations of appli- cable laws, regulations, and internal company policies. We also expect our employees and business partners worldwide to comply with key guidelines and recom- mendations, such as the principles of the eight core labour standards of the International Labour Organi- zation (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational En- terprises, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. All suppliers are also obli- gated to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct.\nOur management and monitoring structures are regu- lated in the company\u2019s Articles of Association, the\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 125\n    Rules of Procedure of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and are in line with the German Corporate Governance Code (see Corporate Governance state- ment chapter).\nThe impacts of any new investment on our compliance management system and, in particular, our human rights obligations are also part of our due diligence process. Human rights and business considerations are both taken into account when making investment decisions.\nResponsibility and organisation\nThe compliance programme, which is anchored in the Group-wide management and supervisory structures, is part of our management culture. It comprises the entire compliance organisation within the Group, the set-up of guidelines, and the verification of compliance with these guidelines. The compliance management addresses all compliance topics that Heidelberg Materials has identified as relevant in the compliance risk assessment.\nThe compliance organisation is under the authority of the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the Director Group Legal & Compliance reports directly. Each country has its own compliance officer, who re- ports directly to the country manager and indirectly to the Group Compliance department. The Compliance function is also responsible for the compliance manage- ment system for human rights. In 2022, the Managing Board appointed a Group human rights officer. In order to implement the human rights compliance programme, two new positions have been created in the Group Compliance department with a focus on human rights expertise. The future incumbents will cover topics rang- ing from risk analysis to preventive and remedial meas- ures \u2013 in both their own business line and the supply chain. Since the end of 2022, a human rights coordina-\ntor has been responsible for human rights compliance management in each of the country organisations. In addition, the country organisations appoint environ- mental experts to assist human rights coordinators as partners in assessing and addressing human rights risks related to environmental aspects.\nPolicies\nOur compliance principles are laid down in the Code of Business Conduct, which covers all compliance topics identified as material for Heidelberg Materials. The or- ganisation of the compliance management system is defined in the internal Compliance Policy.\nIn 2022, we specified standardised rules for all govern- ance documents in a new framework policy. Against this background, several compliance policies have also been adjusted, such as our Group Compliance Incident Reporting & Case Management Guideline, which lays down the principles for reporting compliance issues, processing and investigating submitted complaints, and protecting those reporting the incidents.\nThe Group Anti-Corruption Guideline defines principles such as behaving with integrity towards business part- ners or avoiding conflicts of interest.\nAs regards competition law, the acceptable behaviour for Heidelberg Materials is derived firstly from the ap- plicable antitrust laws including relevant international regulations, such as the antitrust regulations in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. In its Code of Busi- ness Conduct and with the Group Competition Law Guideline, the content of which was also adjusted in 2022, plus the national antitrust law guidelines based on the latter, Heidelberg Materials has made an explic- it internal commitment to strict compliance with anti- trust laws, such as the prohibition of cartels and the abuse of a dominant market position, as well as with the rules of merger control.\n\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 position on human rights is a commitment by the Group to respect human rights. Among other things, it addresses employees\u2019 working conditions, responsibility at our locations (including the rights of indigenous peoples), and the selection of sup- pliers and customers. The internal Guideline on Human Rights Compliance Management regulates the organi- sation and responsibilities associated with implement- ing compliance with human rights.\nProcesses\nThe compliance programme integrated across the Group serves as a cornerstone for achieving our com- pliance targets. A central element of this programme is the self-commitment made by the Group management not to tolerate violations of applicable laws and to im- pose sanctions. The programme also includes internal guidelines and measures that express the legal provi- sions in concrete terms. In addition, suitable corrective and preventive measures are taken to help prevent sim- ilar incidents in the future. Further to annual communi- cation of these guidelines, compliance letters and vid- eo messages are circulated to the workforce. Software is used for the administration of compliance tasks and reporting. The intention is that this will also replace the previous software for compliance risk assessments in 2023. Furthermore, we have established SpeakUp, a web- and telephone-based reporting system accessi- ble across the Group and also to people outside the organisation.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 126\n    As well as face-to-face training, employee training is also carried out online. The range of digital courses, which are mandatory for specified groups of employ- ees, covers topics such as the Code of Business Con- duct, competition law, and the prevention of corrup- tion. In order to achieve a 100% completion rate for all digital compliance training, we require the country managers to additionally report on training attend- ance to the responsible member of the Managing Board. The group of persons required to attend the on- line training courses includes, depending on the course, all employees who have a company email address or employees of specific departments and/or managers. The training courses are mandatory for new hires and are repeated every two years. In addition, training ses- sions are conducted on other compliance topics such as human rights or money laundering. They are carried out both at the request of specific departments and on the instructions of the Compliance function.\nThe entire compliance programme is continuously re- viewed for the need to adapt to current legal and social developments by keeping track of news and exchang- ing information with compliance experts, and is im- proved and further developed accordingly.\nGroup-wide implementation of the compliance pro- gramme is monitored by regular and special audits by Group Internal Audit as well as via half-yearly reporting by the Director Group Legal & Compliance to the Man- aging Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervi- sory Board. The latter monitors the effectiveness of the compliance programme and verifies in particular whether it adequately satisfies the legal requirements and recognised compliance standards. An additional quarterly report informs the Managing Board members with regional responsibility about the most important compliance incidents in their Group areas. Following the adequacy assessment of the compliance manage- ment system of HeidelbergCement AG carried out in\n2021 on the basis of the IDW PS980 auditing standard, which was confirmed without qualification of the audit opinion, the recommendations for improvement have either already been implemented in 2022 or are in im- plementation.\nApproximately every three years, we conduct a com- prehensive analysis to assess and prevent corruption risks and possible conflicts of interest. A rolling ap- proach ensures that different Group countries are an- alysed each year as part of this cycle. First, the poten- tial risks within a country organisation are assessed. Then, the measures already in place to limit these risks are evaluated, and finally, we examine whether further measures are needed. On the basis of this assessment, an action plan is drawn up for each country, and its implementation is monitored by the Group Legal & Compliance department.\nIn the area of competition law, we have a comprehen- sive reporting system on antitrust investigation pro- ceedings. An annual competition law update takes place at the level of the Managing Board and of the employees who report directly to the members of the Managing Board with responsibility for sales. Further- more, annual qualitative assessments of the antitrust risks take place in the countries. A regular external au- dit of the competition law compliance programme is conducted by a specialist law firm approximately every three years.\nWe have established management processes that allow us to exercise effective human rights due diligence and in our opinion meet the requirements of both the United Nations Guiding Principles and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG).\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nIn our country organisations, we carry out human rights risk analyses, which are currently still scheduled to be repeated every three years. The exact timetable is agreed individually with each country organisation. From 2023, HeidelbergCement AG is required by law to carry out annual risk reviews. The process will consider risks relating to discrimination, child or forced labour, risks to freedom of association and collective bargain- ing, risks to fair and safe working conditions, to the right of peoples to self-determination, and to the rights of indigenous peoples. The analysis includes determin- ing potential risks from the perspective of different functions, such as production, procurement, or sales, as well as identifying existing measures and defining additional measures to be implemented. The commit- ment to human rights aspects as a central selection criterion for suppliers is driven forward by our supplier management system. This obliges our partners to commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which re- quires compliance with human rights due diligence ob- ligations as defined by the German LkSG, such as the prohibition of forced labour and rules on non-discrimi- nation.\nMeasures and progress\nNon-compliance with our guidelines by employees may result in disciplinary measures up to and including dis- missal. Violations of corruption or competition laws, human rights, or contractual agreements by third par- ties may result in their exclusion from conducting busi- ness with Heidelberg Materials or require them to meet certain test conditions.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 127\n    Our SpeakUp reporting platform, helps us not only to track compliance violations, but also to improve our preventive measures. SpeakUp is publicised on the in- tranet, on the internet, and at the various locations by means of informative posters. To reinforce our efforts to combat corruption, the country organisations are working on the implementation of individual country measures that were defined as part of the corruption risk assessment. The same applies to competition law and the protection of human rights.\nIn 2022, the preventive activities of the compliance of- ficers once again placed great emphasis on compli- ance with the provisions of competition law and anti- corruption regulations. In order to implement the German LkSG, the compliance officers have intensified their cooperation with the Group department Group Procurement as part of the Responsible Procurement initiative. Other functions were made aware of their hu- man rights due diligence obligations via information events backed by appropriate training measures.\nAfter pandemic-related restrictions were lifted, more training measures could be carried out again in 2022, with virtual concepts continuing to dominate. Compli- ance audits by Group Internal Audit were carried out on-site again.\nEfforts to protect human rights at our own locations \u2013 with a focus on safe working conditions and anti- discrimination \u2013 and in the supply chain continued and were intensified by the new human rights compliance organisation described above and the Responsible Pro- curement initiative. In addition to training activities, this work included systematically assessing human rights risks on a country-by-country basis and compil- ing key indicators relating to human rights. The results were analysed jointly by the respective country organ- isation and the Group Compliance department. The implementation of the agreed action plans for further risk reduction was reviewed and reported to the re- sponsible member of the Managing Board.\nPerformance indicators\n\nAt the end of the reporting year, the compliance e-learning programmes assigned to employees across the Group, covering the Code of Business Conduct and anti-corruption issues, had completion rates of 94%10) and 95%10) respectively.\nElectronic training on antitrust law is additionally as- signed to employees who work in sales or procurement, have management responsibility, or otherwise have contact with competitors, customers, and suppliers, achieving a completion rate of 93%10) at the end of the reporting year. There were also other compliance ac- tivities in the area of antitrust law (seminars, lectures, and other measures).\nThe country organisations are required to report key figures, such as the number of compliance cases re- ported through the case management system that in- volve suspected human rights violations. Apart from cases on health and occupational safety, four cases of discrimination were reported in relation to human rights issues, one of which was confirmed, and seven cases of harassment, with four justified complaints. The con- firmed cases were responded to with sanctions and/or preventive measures.\n18\nOf the 233 incidents reported, around half proved to be unfounded, while for 20%, no final investigation result had been determined by the editorial deadline. For just under 28% of the incidents, the investigations revealed that they were at least partially substantiated. None of the substantiated incident reports had a material im- pact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFor all substantiated cases, measures were taken, ranging from root cause analysis, changes to policies and processes, and communication and training through to disciplinary action (such as a written warn- ing or dismissal). In 42% of the substantiated cases, sanctions are imposed and for 81% of these incidents, preventive measures are implemented.\n10) Since 2022, the training status of the persons to be trained at the end of the financial year has been reported over the two-year training repetition period.\n\n1. **Total Reported Incidents**: \n   - The infographic states that there were 233 incidents reported in the current year. For comparison, the previous year (2021) had 238 reported incidents, indicating a slight decrease in the number of reports.\n\n2. **Methods of Reporting**: \n   - The majority of the reports, 79%, were made through the \"SpeakUp\" compliance reporting system, which seems to be a dedicated platform for reporting compliance-related incidents within the organization.\n   - Of these reports made via the SpeakUp system:\n     - 78% were submitted online.\n     - 22% were made via telephone, highlighting a significant preference for digital reporting over phone calls.\n   - Additionally, 21% of the reports were submitted through more traditional means such as emails or letters, showing that a portion of the workforce still uses conventional communication methods for reporting.\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

This part will focus on the Investigative Independence.\n - Heidelberg Materials assures the investigating committee has structural independence from the implicated chain of command. The Compliance Organization reports directly to the Chairman of the Managing Board via the Director Group Legal & Compliance. This structure ensures that compliance investigations are managed by a department with substantial autonomy and independence from operational management.\n   - Each country has its own compliance officer, who reports directly to the country manager but indirectly to the Group Compliance department. This dual reporting line helps compliance officers preserve their independence from local operational influences.\n - The Chairman of the Managing Board directly oversees the compliance program and investigations. This high-level monitoring ensures that investigations are carried out without any interference from lower levels of the organizational hierarchy.\n   - The Director Group Legal & Compliance submits semi-annual reports to the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. This reporting contains updates on compliance investigations, which ensure openness and supervision at the highest levels of governance.\n   - SpeakUp System: Heidelberg Materials uses the SpeakUp reporting system, which allows employees and third parties to anonymously report compliance issues, such as corruption and bribery. This solution is intended to bypass the affected chain of command, ensuring that reports reach the compliance department immediately.\n   - A structured case management system is used to manage reported occurrences. This mechanism monitors the status of investigations and guarantees that findings are submitted to higher authorities without influence from those concerned.\n-Investigation findings are communicated to the Managing Board and Audit Committee through monthly compliance reports. These reports provide a comprehensive summary of compliance actions, incidents, and outcomes, ensuring that higher-level officials are fully aware of all relevant issues.\n   - Quarterly Updates: In addition to regular reporting, quarterly updates are sent to Managing Board members with regional responsibilities. These updates cover key compliance incidents and their status, guaranteeing continuing oversight and appropriate response.\n- Heidelberg Materials discloses compliance efforts, including important incidents and resolutions, in its Annual and Sustainability Reports. This public disclosure promotes transparency and reflects the company's commitment to ethical conduct.\n   - Regulatory Cooperation: The corporation works with regulatory organizations and follows international efforts such as the United Nations Global Compact. Findings from significant investigations are communicated to appropriate authorities as needed to ensure compliance with external regulatory obligations.\n-The inquiry committee is overseen by the Chairman of the Managing Board and the Audit Committee, ensuring its independence from any implicated chain of command. The institutional and reporting procedures in place provide a solid foundation for impartial investigations.\n   - Compliance Officers' Autonomy  The two reporting lines for country compliance officers increase their independence, allowing them to conduct investigations without being influenced by local management.\n- The organized reporting protocols to higher authorities, which include regular and quarterly reports, guarantee that the findings of compliance investigations are successfully transmitted. This transparency facilitates quick and appropriate decisions by top management and the Supervisory Board.\n   - Public and regulatory transparency:  The dedication to public disclosure and regulatory collaboration strengthens the investigation's credibility. By remaining transparent with stakeholders and regulatory organizations, Heidelberg Materials demonstrates their commitment to ethical practices.\nThe reporting mechanism is the following:\n- The compliance organization is intended to be separate from the operational chain of command, resulting in unbiased investigations.\n- The Chairman of the Managing Board and the Audit Committee regularly oversee investigations to ensure they are handled without interference.\n- Comprehensive reporting standards guarantee that findings are transmitted to higher authorities, promoting transparency and accountability.\n- The commitment to transparency with stakeholders and regulatory organisations contributes to the investigation's integrity.\nHeidelberg fulfils the requirements due to the above mentioned aspects."}]}

Our achievements and progress in the field of sustainabil- ity are equally important. We want our building materials to be used to create intel- ligent, resilient, and sustainable buildings as well as infrastructure for tomorrow \u2013 and we want to keep the ecological footprint associated with their production as small as possible. To underline the importance of sustainability to our business success, we are publishing a combined Annual and Sustainability Report for the first time and underpin our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, whose ten princi- ples relating to human rights, labour standards, the environment, and corruption prevention serve as key guidelines for our entrepreneurial activity.\nHeidelberg Materials \u2013 our new global brand\nYou\u2019ll notice that this report also has a fresh look. In September 2022, we introduced \u201cHeidelberg Materials,\u201d our first global brand in our 150-year history, and work is now underway to gradually roll it out to all Group countries. Our new brand identity will allow us to take full advantage of our organisation\u2019s strengths and represent our positions consistently, both internally and externally. The fact that our colleagues in the Group\u2019s more than 50 countries have responded so positively to our new brand is proof of the great sense of cohesion felt by the Heidelberg Materials team world- wide, I\u2019m personally very pleased of that.\nWe continue to drive our industry\u2019s transformation\nWe have the ambition, the speed, the knowledge, the technologies, and the partners to lead the necessary process of transformation in our sector. Our focus is on ex- panding our portfolio of sustainable products, rapidly and significantly reducing our CO2 emissions, proving that the production of carbon-neutral products is possible on a large scale, and creating a circular economy by rigorously implementing the prin- ciple of circularity. Our recently tightened Sustainability Commitments 2030 under- score this ambition.\n\u201cWe must take the entire value chain into account if we\u2019re to achieve climate neutrality.\u201d\nDr Dominik von Achten\nWe continue to make good progress towards net zero. We succeeded in reducing our specific net CO2 emissions by a further 2% in the 2022 financial year. But we must take the entire value chain into account, from raw materials to reuse, if we\u2019re to achieve climate neutrality. That\u2019s why we pushed ahead our recycling activities, a particular focus of our portfolio optimisation in 2022. By acquiring recycling compa- nies in Germany, the UK, and the USA, we have taken another important step towards implementing our circular economy strategy.\nCCUS roadmap as the key to decarbonisation\nOn our journey towards climate-neutrality, CCUS \u2013 carbon capture, utilisation, and storage \u2013 is a crucial tool for us as a building materials manufacturer when it comes to dealing with the raw material-related process emissions that have been unavoid- able up to now. As early as next year, 2024, we will put the world\u2019s first industrial- scale carbon capture facility at a cement plant into operation in Brevik, Norway. This will make us a front runner in the use of this key technology for decarbonising our industry.\nWith a portfolio of nine innovative, industrial-scale CCUS projects to date, we are continuing to expand our pioneering role. In 2022, we launched our largest CCUS project so far in Mitchell, USA, which will have the capacity to capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year. In early 2023, we announced two more major CCUS projects. At our plant in Antoing, Belgium, we will build a state-of-the-art hybrid carbon capture facility that will help us to reduce our CO2 emissions by 800,000 tonnes. We\u2019re planning the same capacity at our plant in Devnya, Bulgaria. Both projects are scheduled to start in 2028.\n\nTo our stakeholders\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n(Aktiengesetz, AktG). The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that both Mr Mucic and Mr Merckle have exper- tise in the areas of accounting and auditing. For more information, see the Corporate Governance state- ment chapter.\nIn the reporting year, the Personnel Committee fo- cused on the preliminary discussion and recommenda- tion to the Supervisory Board regarding the determina- tion of the variable Managing Board remuneration for the 2021 financial year and on the definition of param- eters for the variable Managing Board remuneration in 2022 and in the years from 2022 to 2024/25, respec- tively. Finally, the Personnel Committee assured itself that all members of the Managing Board have car- ried out the required individual investment in HeidelbergCement AG shares as part of the Managing Board remuneration system.\nThe Sustainability and Innovation Committee, which was newly formed in the reporting year, received re- ports about the Sustainability Office from the Manag- ing Board and dealt with sustainability topics, in par- ticular with regard to the decarbonisation roadmap, ESG benchmarking, and the status and development of the Innovation Hub, a department within the Sustaina- bility Office that brings together and promotes innova- tive ideas.\nDue to the announced resignation from the Super- visory Board of Mr Fritz-J\u00fcrgen Heckmann and Mr Tobias Merckle, the Nomination Committee discussed the issue of succession in the reporting year. It recom- mended that the Supervisory Board propose Dr Bernd Scheifele and Dr Sopna Sury to the 2022 Annual Gen- eral Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board as successors to the two resigning shareholder represent- atives.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 15\n    The Mediation Committee, formed in accordance with section 27(3) of the German Codetermination Law (MitbestG), did not need to meet.\nThe results of the committees\u2019 meetings were reported at the subsequent plenary sessions.\nDuring the reporting year, there were no potential con- flicts of interest of any Managing Board or Supervisory Board member that would have had to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board without undue delay. There were also no consulting or other contracts for services or work between any member of the Supervisory Board and the company in the 2022 reporting year.\nIn the reporting period, there were no transactions with related parties requiring disclosure within the meaning of sections 111a(1)(2) and 111b(1) of the AktG.\nCorporate Governance\nThe declaration of compliance in the reporting year was submitted by the Supervisory Board on 31 January 2022 and by the Managing Board on 11 February 2022. The declaration of compliance for the current year was submitted by the Managing Board on 13 January 2023 and by the Supervisory Board on 30 January 2023. The complete text can be found in the Declaration of com- pliance section pursuant to section 161 of the AktG in the Corporate Governance statement chapter. The current declaration of compliance is made permanent- ly available on the company\u2019s website.\nWith regard to its composition and that of the Manag- ing Board, the Supervisory Board thoroughly complies with the guidelines of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code regarding the principles of diversity when appointing corporate bodies and leadership positions within the Group and of section 289f(2)(6) of the Ger- man Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) (diversity concept). Regarding its own composition, it\nimplements the diversity targets stated in the Code and the profile of skills for the Supervisory Board agreed on 11 September 2017. Detailed information on this topic can be found in the Corporate Governance statement chapter.\nIn March 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to set the target figure for the proportion of women on the Managing Board to at least one woman for the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025. With Dr Nicola Kimm as a member of the Managing Board since 1 September 2021, this target was achieved ahead of schedule. The Supervisory Board also welcomes and supports the Managing Board\u2019s target of further increasing the pro- portion of women in management positions in the first and second leadership levels below the Managing Board. For details, please refer to the Corporate Gov- ernance statement chapter.\nWith regard to the remuneration for the members of the Managing Board for the 2022 financial year, specif- ics are included in the Remuneration report chapter to avoid repetition. A description of the adjusted ver- sion of the Managing Board remuneration system, ap- plicable from 1 January 2021, can also be found here. Having been commissioned to do so by the company, the auditor also carried out the voluntary audit of the correctness of the content of the 2022 remuneration report and issued an unqualified audit opinion. The Su- pervisory Board examined the remuneration report in detail in the presence of the auditor and approved the report together with the Managing Board. The 2022 remuneration report will be submitted to the 2023 An- nual General Meeting for approval and will be available on the company\u2019s website for ten years.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are themselves responsible for obtaining the training required for their tasks and are supported by the company in this respect. The company also offers specific training sessions \u2013\n             \nTo our stakeholders\nReport of the Supervisory Board\nsometimes with external support \u2013 for members of the Supervisory Board, most recently in November 2022. These training courses cover topics that are particular- ly relevant to the company and the work of the Super- visory Board \u2013 for example, with regard to legal chang- es, the selection of suitable investment projects, the ongoing development of the company\u2019s antitrust law compliance system, the company\u2019s risk management system, the implementation of EU taxonomy, and the changes to the German Corporate Governance Code. If required, new members of the Supervisory Board are given an introduction to the legal framework surround- ing the Supervisory Board and can also meet with members of the Managing Board and line managers to discuss fundamental and current issues in order to gain an overview of the topics that are relevant to the com- pany. New Supervisory Board members also receive comprehensive information about the corporate gov- ernance of the company as well as insider law process- es and obligations.\nIn addition, the Managing Board reports on corporate governance at Heidelberg Materials also for the Super- visory Board in the Corporate Governance statement chapter.\nWith the statements listed above, the Supervisory Board has reaffirmed its commitment to effective cor- porate governance in the Group.\nAuditing and approval of annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements, and non-financial statement\nBefore the contract for the auditing of the annual finan- cial statements of the company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group was awarded, the points of focus for the audit and the content of the audit were discussed in detail with the auditor, Price- waterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesell- schaft, Frankfurt am Main. The Audit Committee dis-\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 16\n    cussed the costs of the audit and with the auditor the assessment of audit risk, the audit strategy, audit plan- ning, and the audit results with the auditor. The Chair- man of the Audit Committee and the auditor regularly exchanged information on the progress of the audit, after which the Chairman reported to the committee.\nIn January 2023, the Managing Board informed the Supervisory Board about the preliminary, unaudited key figures for the 2022 financial year and provided a status report on the financial statements work. The an- nual financial statements of HeidelbergCement AG, the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, and the combined management report for the company and the Group, as prepared by the Managing Board, were examined by the auditor. In addition, the auditor performed a limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement (sections 289b and 315b of the HGB) contained in the combined management re- port on behalf of the Supervisory Board. The financial statements together with the reading copies of the au- ditors\u2019 reports were sent in advance to the members of the Supervisory Board. At first, the Audit Committee dealt intensively with the financial statements docu- ments (including the non-financial statement) in the presence of the auditor. The auditor reported on the main results of its audit. In addition, the Audit Commit- tee had the auditor report on the effectiveness of the internal control and early risk identification system in relation to accounting, whereby the auditor stated that he had not found any significant weaknesses in this re- gard. Against this background and after its own con- sideration, the Audit Committee determined that the internal control system, the internal audit system, and the risk management system, including the early risk identification system, meet the requirements to be placed on them. The Supervisory Board shares the opinion of the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of these systems. Then, the Supervisory Board discussed the financial statement documents (including the\nnon-financial statement) in detail, once again in the presence of the auditor. Respective discussions in the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board also took place without the participation of the Managing Board. The Supervisory Board approved the audit results. It examined the annual financial statements and consol- idated financial statements, the combined manage- ment report (including the non-financial statement), and the Managing Board\u2019s proposal for the use of the balance sheet profit. The results of the pre-audit con- ducted by the Audit Committee and the results of its own audit correspond fully to the results of the auditor. The Supervisory Board raised no objections to the final results of this examination. The auditor issued an un- qualified audit opinion on the annual financial state- ments of HeidelbergCement AG and the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022 as well as the combined management report of HeidelbergCement AG and the Group.\nThe Supervisory Board approved the Managing Board\u2019s proposal for the use of the balance sheet profit, includ- ing the payout of a dividend of \u20ac2.60 per share (previ- ous year: \u20ac2.40).\n  \n\nSustainability\nCompliance\nCompliance\nCompliance is a vital element of our corporate values. The public image of Heidelberg Materials is shaped by the conduct of each and every employee. We respect the cultures and laws of the countries in which we operate as well as the local people and institutions. With our Code of Business Conduct, we have introduced a Group-wide set of rules to which all of us are com- mitted.\nCompliant behaviour is at the heart of our business activities\nWe can only achieve success by working as a team \u2013 and compliance is no exception. In turn, this means that compliance work itself must be clearly defined by rules and widely communicated. This is the role of our compliance management system. In addition to over- seeing the system, the Managing Board takes the lead when it comes to reminding the workforce of their com- pliance obligations.\nCompliant behaviour is also integral to our business model. Our production and extraction sites are gener- ally designed for a service life of several decades. To maintain operating permits at our locations over these long periods and to renew our mining concessions at the required intervals, we need the constant support of the public and must prove our integrity time and time again.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 28\n    Our compliance management system\nOur compliance management system consists of seven elements, which are also laid down in the auditing standard 980 issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer in Deutsch- land e.V., IDW).\n\u2013 Our compliance culture is documented in our Code of Business Conduct.\n\u2013 Our Code of Business Conduct and other compliance guidelines also define clear compliance targets.\n\u2013 We generally carry out compliance risk assess- ments to help guide our compliance work, but also to specifically address the topics of anti-corruption and human rights.\n\u2013 Our compliance programme includes, in particular, guidelines, a whistle-blower system and case man- agement, sanctions screening, and reviews of busi- ness partners.\n\u2013 The compliance organisation clearly defines re- sponsibilities and ensures complete coverage of all compliance topics.\n\u2013 Compliance communications include web-based and face-to-face training, videos, posters, online in- formation, compliance letters, and other media use.\n\u2013 Regular compliance checks are primarily carried out by Group Internal Audit.\nWe regularly make our employees aware of compliance matters. The topic is firmly integrated into all work processes through training opportunities and practical application on a daily basis. If there is no specific guide- line on how to act in a particular situation, the compli- ance team can be consulted to give recommendations in line with our ethical standards and our Code of Busi- ness Conduct. We carry out our responsibilities towards customers, suppliers, official bodies, and business partners with honesty, integrity, and professionalism.\nWe believe that adhering to the principles of our Code of Business Conduct ensures the business success of Heidelberg Materials, creates a working environment built on trust, and leads to higher levels of satisfaction among all of our company\u2019s stakeholders. Non-financial statement\n\n\nSustainability\nOur employees\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 56\n    trend through active generation management and by offering numerous health management and preventive care measures adapted to regional requirements.\nFlexible working time models, a digital workplace, and mobile working have become the norm for us in our commitment to work-life balance. This offering is com- plemented by virtual workshops and preventive screen- ing, covering many different health topics, as part of our health management activities. The sports groups, courses, and our own gym at our headquarters support mental and physical health. To promote sustainable and flexible mobility, we also subsidise offers such as the JobTicket public transport and JobRad bike leasing schemes.\nThrough trainee programmes, dual apprenticeship and study partnerships, specialist and managerial develop- ment, and professional training, we invest specifically in the best possible qualification of our employees. With our e-campus and the possibility of international work assignments, we can also hold our own in the global labour market.\nRemuneration policy and working time regulation\nThe remuneration systems at Heidelberg Materials are based on performance and results in accordance with the market standards for internationally operating companies in our sector. Alongside fixed remuneration governed by a collective agreement or an individual work contract, our employees also receive variable re- muneration elements based on their individual perfor- mance and on corporate success. Our CO2 reduction\ntargets are consistently anchored in our global remu- neration systems as well: the full variable remuneration can only be achieved if both the financial targets and the sustainability target are met. This regulation has applied to all members of the Managing Board and to every bonus-eligible employee worldwide since the start of the 2021 financial year.\nWe consciously aim to achieve a high variable element as part of the total remuneration of our managers in order to directly reflect the connection between per- sonal performance and corporate success.\nCollective regulations apply to more than half of the Group\u2019s employees. The employees in our foreign sub- sidiaries benefit otherwise from attractive remunera- tion systems that correspond to the respective local market conditions.\nOur working time regulations comply with the legal re- quirements in effect at our respective locations. We promote adherence to these regulations by means of our whistle-blower system, which employees can use to individually report possible violations (passive monitor- ing). To enable flexible working time options, we offer models such as flexitime, working time accounts, part- time work, and leaves of absence, for example in the form of a sabbatical, to our employees in many coun- tries. Older employees also have the option of switch- ing to partial retirement.\nEmployment and co-determination\nEmployee co-determination has always been of great importance to us. Statutory, collective bargaining, and company regulations are implemented jointly in close cooperation with employee representatives. The works council and Group management work together in a spirit of trust.\nIn accordance with the defined co-determination and participation rights, the relevant committees are in- formed in good time so that opinions can be obtained, and then agreements are made with them. Heidelberg Materials works consistently and intensively with em- ployee representatives in a spirit of trust. These repre- sentatives are involved in numerous committees and are informed at an early stage about operational changes. In the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation to achieve a socially re- sponsible solution and, for example, initially examine the possibility of transferring employees within the Group. If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the indi- vidual impact through retraining, early-retirement schemes, outplacement, and severance payments. Non-financial statement\n \nSustainability\nOur employees\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 58\n    Education\nFor Heidelberg Materials, forward-looking HR manage- ment means consistently investing in training. With an apprentice retention rate of 85% in Germany, steady growth of qualified young talent is guaranteed.\nIn addition to technical skills for ensuring functionally sound processes, digital competences have also be- come indispensable. We already cover the technical part with virtual learning platforms and multilingual e-learning courses, specifically developed by the Ger- man Cement Works Association (VDZ). A complete ed- ucational offering is ensured through additional train- ing covering professional use of programmes for virtual communication and cooperation, how to deal personally with the new work and life situation, and topics of mental health and resilience.\nAs a manufacturing Group, occupational safety is al- ways a key element of our training and career develop- ment programmes. In addition, we focus our efforts on specialist training and the training of our managers. Our training programmes in virtually every work area are characterised by practical and business-oriented learning and enable our employees to develop their skills in the best possible way.\nThe Cement Academy of the Competence Center Cement (CCC) offers seminars and training sessions around the world for the engineers and technicians at our cement plants, while the Aggregates Academy of the Competence Center Aggregates & Asphalt (CCA) provides apprenticeships and employee training in the aggregates business line. Process simulators and various web-based learning programmes, including the\nmultilingual Cement Manufacturing Curriculum, on which more than 3,000 employees are enrolled, are regularly used to supplement our classroom courses.\nStrengthening digital competences\nThere is undeniably a need to build and expand digital competences, drive change processes in the context of digital transformation, and further digitalise personnel processes and systems. Our efforts are focused on fundamental digital media skills as well as topics relat- ed to specific functions. To increase the transparency of our digital activities for employees, all key global digitalisation projects and the tools used within the Group are explained on a platform to which all employ- ees have access. We used external training databases to also significantly expand e-learning offerings on var- ious digitalisation topics in the past year.\nTraining on the use of virtual communication and col- laboration tools also accounted for a large part of de- mand in the past year. To meet this demand, we offer both in-house courses and comprehensive digital train- ing and certification from external partners (Microsoft certification tracks).\nSuccessor planning\nSecuring and developing junior executives is an impor- tant pillar of our personnel development strategy. We have intensified our activities aimed at expanding our development programmes and strengthening our re- cruitment of university graduates worldwide. We offer them extensive, international trainee programmes fo- cusing on the areas of technology, sales, finance, HR, and procurement, as well as interdisciplinary posts.\nThrough a special programme, we also equip highly qualified engineers in the cement business for senior engineering positions. The participants undergo indi- vidually tailored training programmes that allow them to gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to prepare them for the next stage of their career. Spending time at cement plants in different countries is a key element of the programme\u2019s success.\nSince 2013, Heidelberg Materials has been the proud recipient of the trainee seal of the German initiative for career-enhancing and fair trainee programmes each year for our programmes for the advancement of future executives. As a member of the Fair Company initiative and bearer of the Fair Company seal, we have also been voluntarily committed to the creation of fair and attractive working conditions for trainees and young professionals. Non-financial statement\n \n\nWe work hard to minimise and prevent risks for our em- ployees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties. To this end, we carry out regular risk assessments at our locations so that we can evaluate risks and take appropriate protective measures. Based on the results of these risk assessments, we have introduced and continuously updated various Group-wide safety standards in recent years in order to address activities with particularly high risks consistently. These stand- ards are translated into local measures at our locations and, if necessary, supplemented by additional meas- ures. As part of workplace inspections, we check com- pliance with these internal standards as well as with other legally mandated external requirements. Any shortcomings we identify are rectified as quickly as possible.\nAll our measures give due consideration not only to our own employees but also to the employees of external companies. They work for us in areas such as produc- tion, maintenance and repair, transport, other services, and consulting. We have therefore addressed the issue of contractor safety with a separate Group standard to take account of the particular requirements placed on external companies as well as those that must be met by Heidelberg Materials when engaging external companies.\nTransport is another important focus of our work, as traffic accidents have unfortunately repeatedly led to uninvolved third parties sustaining injuries or even los- ing their lives. We address this issue in training courses for our own drivers and those who drive on our behalf. The driver training courses aim to raise drivers\u2019 safety\nawareness so that they can identify and reduce poten- tial risks at an early stage. This training in defensive driving is not only theory based; it is also increasingly delivered using driving simulators, at driving safety centers, or through supervised driving. In addition, we are making greater use of technical aids. As well as fitting vehicles with various assistance systems and using such systems, examples of this approach also include checking the roadworthiness of third-party vehicles before loading.\nImproving mental health\nIn addition to the measures outlined above for the pre- vention of accidents and standard occupational dis- eases, various Group countries are also increasingly working with external organisations in order to improve the mental health of employees. The idea is to raise awareness of mental health problems and train em- ployees to recognise warning signs and offer support. The aim of the measures is to dispel prejudices and encourage those affected to talk about their problems and seek help.\nIn recognition of the sensitivity of the topic and to make it easier for those affected to access appropriate services, many of our subsidiaries offer external sup- port programmes that provide help anonymously and free of charge. Countries in which such programmes are available include Germany, the UK, Belgium, Canada, the USA, and Australia.\nNon-financial statement\n \n\n    As a global Group with a strong regional business fo- cus, we operate at many locations across the world. Our production and quarrying sites are generally de- signed for a service life of several decades. To maintain acceptance of our business activities at the sites over these long periods, we are active in the communities close to our plants and fulfil our corporate social re- sponsibility (CSR). We create jobs and promote local economic development with our wages, investment, purchasing, and taxes, particularly in economically weak regions.\nSocial engagement at our locations\nWe have made a commitment to social responsibility in our Code of Business Conduct. At our locations, we strive for a constructive, trusting, and neighbourly re- lationship with local residents. We support the social and economic development of our neighbouring com- munities and foster transparent communication with all stakeholders. We aim to work with local partners to create added value both for our Group and for the local communities. People in the communities where we op- erate also expect us to contribute to the areas sur- rounding our production sites by regularly providing information about our business activities and through our commitment to local social, economic, and environ- mental development. Taking social responsibility and\nmaintaining good relationships with our stakeholders \u2013 particularly at our production sites \u2013 are management tasks. The national management team, together with the national CSR manager, is responsible for social en- gagement in each country. Funding decisions for indi- vidual countries are made by the national management teams within their budgetary framework. Together with the location representatives, they are also responsible for analysing local needs and for selecting, implement- ing, and monitoring projects.\nInvolving local communities\nWe involve local communities in our business activities through various dialogue formats as well as communi- ty engagement plans. Among other things, these strat- egies include long-term partnerships with non-govern- mental and non-profit organisations. In addition, we keep the local communities and stakeholders informed via newsletters or at open days.\nWe have also defined clear evaluation criteria to ensure that our activities are both transparent and effective. We support projects, initiatives, and organisations that are active at our locations or to which we have a direct link. We attach great importance to ensuring that the guidelines and principles of these organisations align with our own corporate philosophy.\nOur engagement is focused on the following areas:\n\u2013 Culture: we promote cultural initiatives for all age groups in our local communities.\n\u2013 Environment: we support initiatives that promote environmental protection and strengthen the diver- sity of nature at our locations.\n\u2013 Infrastructure: we provide practical help in the con- struction of buildings and infrastructure by making products, financial means, and expertise available.\n\u2013 Education: in this area, we are guided by the specif- ic needs of our locations. We foster potential and encourage initiatives such as education partner- ships.\nFocus of our engagement in 2022\nAt Heidelberg Materials, we stepped up our humanitar- ian efforts in 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. The country organisation in Poland, for example, took direct action and made the conference center on site available to host refugees. In addition to nu- merous other initiatives there, financial aid was provid- ed for Ukrainian students at the University of Opole, a charity run was organised, and deliveries of relief sup- plies to Ukraine were supported. In Germany, too, one of our buildings was made available to host refugees and a fundraising campaign was organised among employees.\n\nCombined management report\nFundamentals of the Group\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 business model encompasses the entire value chain, from the extraction of raw ma- terials to further processing into cement through to the end product, concrete and its recycling.\nHeidelberg Materials operates as a fully integrated building materials company. Key business processes include the extraction of raw materials, the production of building materials, as well as their sales and distri- bution to customers. Operating activities are support- ed by central competence centers for technology as well as by shared service centers in individual countries and regions. Operating business processes include the geological exploration of raw material deposits, the purchase or lease of the land where the deposits are located, applying for mining concessions and environ- mental impact assessments, the construction of man- ufacturing facilities in cooperation with external service providers, as well as the actual production of building materials, including extracting raw materials, process- ing and recycling building materials, and maintenance of the facilities.\nProducts\nOur core products cement, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt are homogeneous bulk goods. Their product characteristics are mostly standardised in order to ensure the required stability, reliability, and processability in the application.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 67\n    Cements are classified according to their early and final strength as well as their composition. In addition to cements that consist of almost 100% clinker, there are so-called composite cements, in which a portion of the clinker is replaced by alternative raw materials, such as fly ash, ground slag, or limestone. Cement is used as a binder mainly in concrete production.\nAggregates (sand, gravel, and crushed rock) are clas- sified according to their particle size and texture. They are the main component in the production of concrete and asphalt but are also used as base courses in the construction of infrastructure, such as roads.\nConcrete is a mixture of aggregates (about 80%), cement (about 12%), and water. Concrete is usually delivered to the construction site by ready-mix trucks and is poured locally into forms. Moreover, concrete is also used for the production of precast concrete parts, such as stairs, ceiling elements, or structural compo- nents.\nAsphalt is a mixture of aggregates (about 95%) and bitumen and is generally used as a top layer in road construction.\nLocations and sales markets\nDue to the heavy weight of cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete in proportion to their price, pro- duction is usually located in close proximity to the sales markets. The cement transportation radius by road normally does not exceed 200 km. The delivery radius for aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt by road is generally less than 100 km. Consequently, we have local production sites in more than 50 countries in which we offer building materials.\nWe operate around 130 cement plants (plus a further 20 as part of joint ventures), just under 600 quarries and aggregates pits, as well as around 1,320 ready- mixed concrete production sites worldwide. In total, the Group employs 50,780 people at around 2,500 loca- tions on five continents. There are additionally more than 350 production sites belonging to joint ventures.\nOrganisational structure\nThe Group is divided into five geographical Group areas: Western and Southern Europe, Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia, North America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin. Our global trading activities, especially the trading of cement and clinker, are pooled together in the sixth Group area, Group Services.\nWithin the geographical Group areas, we have divided our activities into four business lines. The cement and aggregates business lines comprise the essential raw materials that are required for the manufacture of the downstream products ready-mixed concrete and as- phalt, which are combined in our third business line. The fourth business line, service-joint ventures-other, pri- marily covers the activities of our joint ventures.\n\n\nCountries/locations\nImportance of sustainability to the business model\nWe want to significantly reduce the impact of our busi- ness activities on the climate and lower our carbon footprint. As a leading building materials manufacturer, we see it as our responsibility to play a decisive role in transforming our industry to meet current and future needs. We want to make a substantial contribution to sustainable construction and carbon neutrality and assume social and environmental responsibility.\nClimate protection is an integral part of the Group strategy. The production of cement generates a large amount of CO2 due to the chemical processes involved in burning clinker and the high temperatures this re- quires. Therefore, we are making greater use of alter- native raw materials and fuels to reduce CO2 emissions. We also optimise our production processes to increase energy efficiency. To reduce the consumption of pri- mary raw materials, we are committed to circularity and strengthening the circular economy. At product level, our focus is on the broad introduction of low-car- bon cements and concretes, the use of recycled mate-\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nInformation according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system that translates the EU\u2019s climate and environmental ob- jectives into criteria for certain environmentally sus- tainable economic activities for investment purposes. Economic activities are recognised as \u201cenvironmental- ly sustainable\u201d if they make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives while not significantly harming any of the other defined environmental objectives. In addition, minimum social standards must be met.\nAssessment of taxonomy eligibility\nThe portfolio of our business activities was assessed in the reporting year with regard to taxonomy eligibility under the delegated acts on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition to 3.7 Manufacture of ce- ment (represented in the following as the cement busi- ness line), 5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste (represented in the following as the recycled ag- gregates operating line within the aggregates business line) has been identified as a relevant economic activi- ty (see Circular economy section) and included in the reporting pursuant to the requirements of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. There are also other tax- onomy-eligible economic activities within Heidelberg Materials\u2019 business lines, such as transport services, which are, however, not shown separately and are in- cluded in the reporting for the cement business line and activity 3.7.\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 other business activities, such as the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line, are taxonomy-non-eligible under the currently known legal acts. We also analysed cross-sectional economic ac- tivities for the CapEx and OpEx KPIs, but this did not result in any additional reportable activities.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 114\n    Review of the technical screening criteria\nThe technical screening criteria for taxonomy align- ment with the act on climate change mitigation were reviewed by an interdisciplinary working group and with the involvement of further experts, especially with re- gard to the interpretation of the \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d (DNSH) criteria. The requirements of the climate change adaptation act were not pursued further, as we are currently unable to achieve taxonomy-aligned rev- enue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure in accordance with the regulation.\nTo review the criteria determining whether a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (substantial contribution criteria) is made, internal reporting sys- tems and data were used to verify compliance with the respective limit values at plant level. The analysis dif- ferentiates between the various types of plants (inte- grated plants, clinker plants, grinding plants) on the basis of the reporting definitions set out by the GCCA industry association.\nFor the somewhat more qualitative DNSH criteria, the individual (legal) requirements and their applicability to Heidelberg Materials were reviewed and potential ap- proaches for proving the alignment of the individual plants were devised. For example, a location-based assessment for climate change adaptation was devel- oped, covering various climate scenarios and time ho- rizons. If risks are identified, the plants will be expected to implement appropriate adaptation measures. At the same time, for criteria such as \u201cprotection and resto- ration of biodiversity and ecosystems\u201d or \u201csustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\u201d use is made of existing processes. We regularly assess the proximity of our operational sites to protected areas and, if necessary, develop biodiversity management plans. For the \u201csustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\u201d criterion, we have extended our existing approach of creating water management\nplans and make use of the assessment of (potential) risks and impacts carried out for this purpose.\nFor the manufacture of cement and the \u201cpollution pre- vention and control\u201d criterion, we use, among other things, our long-established processes for monitoring air pollutants to verify compliance. We have also exam- ined the additional requirements for the products we manufacture, such as those relating to placing hazard- ous substances on the market. We come to the conclu- sion that these criteria are fulfilled. With respect to circular economy, there are no requirements within the Taxonomy Regulation for 3.7 Manufacture of cement and 5.9 Material recovery from non-hazardous waste.\nIn order to comply with the minimum safeguards, we have closely coordinated with the Group Legal and Compliance department and compared our existing measures on human rights, anti-corruption, fair com- petition, and taxation with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. As we have been implementing compliance processes in these areas for many years and are continuously reviewing and expanding them, we have come to the conclusion that the minimum safeguards are being met. One current example of our continuous optimisation efforts, is our work in the field of human rights to further expand our analysis of sig- nificant risks and their impact on potentially affected parties. Particularly with respect to our supply chains, we have supplemented our existing risk management with suitable processes (in the context of the require- ments of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), among other things). Further information on this topic can be found in the Compliance section.\nExplanation of the key figures\nThe key figures revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) relevant to the Tax- onomy Regulation were determined with reference to the definitions set out in the Annex to the Delegated\n  \n\nThe image is a detailed infographic illustrating various sustainability commitments and demographic data for an organization. The infographic is structured around commitments for a \"safe and inclusive future\" and includes statistics on leadership, training, and workforce demographics. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Sustainability Commitments\n1. **25% of Leadership Positions Filled by Women**: This commitment indicates the organization's goal to enhance gender diversity in leadership roles.\n2. **100% of Sites to Have Community Engagement Plans by 2030**: This commitment shows the organization\u2019s dedication to being actively involved in community engagement across all its locations by the year 2030.\n3. **50% Reduction in LTIFR (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) Compared with 2020**: The organization aims to halve its rate of workplace injuries that result in time lost from work, compared to the year 2020, and aims for zero fatalities.\n4. **1 Day of Paid Leave for Voluntary Community Work Per Year**: This policy offers all employees one day of paid leave annually to engage in voluntary community service.\n\n### Workforce Demographics\n1. **Age Structure within the Group**:\n   - **Under 30 Years**: 11% of the workforce\n   - **30-49 Years**: 51% of the workforce\n   - **50+ Years**: 38% of the workforce\n   These statistics provide insight into the age distribution of the organization's employees, indicating a mature workforce with the majority being between 30 and 49 years old.\n\n2. **14% Share of Female Executives**: This data point details the percentage of female employees holding executive roles with leadership responsibilities (referred to as N-1 and N-2 levels).\n\n### Training Hours\n- **28 Hours Per Employee**: The infographic also breaks down the average training hours per employee:\n   - **Occupational Safety Training**: 55%\n   - **Specialist Training**: 30%\n   - **Other**: 5%\n   - **Soft Skills Training**: 4%\n   - **Management Training**: 4%\n   - **Language Courses**: 2%\n   This indicates the organization\u2019s focus on continuous learning and development, with a significant emphasis on occupational safety and specialist training.\n\nOverall, the infographic effectively communicates the organization\u2019s key sustainability initiatives and workforce demographics, highlighting its commitment to safety, community engagement, and diversity. The distribution of training topics underscores a robust approach to professional development, ensuring employees are well-equipped for their roles.\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nResponsibility towards our employees Employees\nHeidelberg Materials has around 51,000 employees worldwide. We want to offer attractive working condi- tions and jobs with a secure future. For us, a good per- sonnel policy means respecting our employees with their range of talents, qualities, and diversity of expe- rience as well as creating the right conditions to allow them to do their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As a manufacturing company, we also attach importance to occupational safety and the protection of our em- ployees\u2019 health.\nAt the end of 2022, the number of employees at Heidelberg Materials stood at 50,780 (previous year: 51,209), based on full-time equivalents. The decrease of around 430 employees essentially results from two opposing developments. On the one hand, around 1,200 jobs were cut across the Group as a result of portfolio optimisation measures, the realisation of synergies, efficiency gains in sales and administration, as well as location optimisations. On the other hand, around 770 new employees joined the Group, among others in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Information on the number of employees in the Group areas can be found in the segment reporting.\nIn the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close consultation with employee representatives to achieve a socially responsible solution. For example, we initially examine the possibility of transferring em- ployees within the Group. If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the individual impact through retraining, early-retirement schemes, outplacement, and sever- ance payments.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 120\n    Diversity, equity, and inclusion\nGroup-wide, we aim for a mix of diverse nationalities, personalities, skills, and experience. We see the diver- sity in our workforce in terms of cultural and ethnic or- igin, gender, age, mental and physical abilities, and sexual orientation and identity as an asset to our glob- al teams. We are convinced that this diversity, in har- mony with an appreciative corporate culture, has a positive effect on our innovative strength and the com- mitment of our employees.\nThe international composition of our top and senior management also gives us the benefit of a broad range of experience from different cultural backgrounds. This allows us to respond flexibly and quickly to global chal- lenges as well as local market needs. The proportion of local managers at the upper management level amounts to around 80%.\nAt our headquarters, we aim to ensure that the work- force is composed of employees from the countries in which we operate, with the intention of improving cooperation with local personnel. Currently, more than 50 different nationalities are represented at our head- quarters.\nThere are trade unions and similar organisations in nearly all of the countries in which Heidelberg Materials operates. We also engage in regular, open dialogue with representatives of these organisations.\nTargets and commitments\nOur aim is to attract and develop highly qualified and committed employees worldwide who bring their indi- vidual skills and different perspectives to our company and thus contribute to our business success.\nIn 2022, we defined a new, ambitious target for the proportion of women at management level. In Germa- ny, we want the proportion of women in the first and second leadership levels below the Managing Board to reach 27% on each level by 2027. Our global target is for women to occupy 25% of management positions by 2030.\nWe have been signatories to the Diversity Charter since early 2013.\nResponsibility and organisation\nThe Group Human Resources (HR) department is sub- ordinate to the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the Director Group Human Resources reports directly. Group HR is also responsible for the topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Each country has its own personnel organisation and sets country-specific human resources priorities. The individual HR directors of the countries report directly to the general manager of the respective country and, in a functional reporting line, to the Group Human Resources department.\nMembers of the employee committees at the individu- al locations form the General Works Council for HeidelbergCement AG and the Group Works Council. The representative body for severely disabled employ- ees is embedded in the local works council for the headquarters in Heidelberg.\nPolicies\nHeidelberg Materials is committed to upholding the core labour standards of the International Labour Or- ganization (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights developed by the United Nations. More- over, we have enshrined this commitment in our Lead- ership Principles. We expect our employees worldwide\n\nto comply with these central guidelines and recommen- dations.\nOur Code of Business Conduct is binding across the Group and describes our values as well as our ethical and legal standards. These include non-discriminatory employment conditions and an open and fair dialogue with employee representatives.\nWith the Company Agreement on Mobile Working in Germany, we are placing particular emphasis on mak- ing our working time models more flexible in order to help our employees achieve a better work-life balance.\nWe have defined guidelines within the Group that concern, for example, respectful behaviour towards co-workers, the involvement and development of em- ployees, a commitment to a strong feedback culture, and the importance of our customers to our corporate success. We urge our managers and employees world- wide to adapt the way they behave towards one anoth- er accordingly, taking local circumstances into ac- count.\nProcesses\nEmployee and employer representatives maintain a close and regular dialogue. For instance, monthly meetings take place between Human Resources repre- sentatives and the works councils at the various loca- tions. Furthermore, the works council organises quar- terly staff meetings at the headquarters, which are attended by the Chairman of the Managing Board and the Director Group Human Resources every six months. A meeting of the General Works Council is held once a year, to which the Chairman of the Managing Board, the Managing Director of the German organisation, the Director Group Human Resources, and the Director HR for Germany are invited. In addition, the works council has formed various committees which liaise with the Group Human Resources department as required.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 121\n    Examples include the Personnel Planning Committee, data protection, IT systems, and monthly meetings with the works council at headquarters. Group man- agement and employee representatives also engage in an established, constructive dialogue in the European Works Council.\nHuman resources issues are considered at Managing Board meetings to which the Director Group Human Resources is invited depending on the topic. The Super- visory Board meets at specified intervals to discuss personnel issues related to the Managing Board.\nWe have embedded key leadership principles in stand- ard human resources processes. In annual salary re- view processes, we ensure that the remuneration of our managers and employees not covered by collective agreements develops appropriately for each individu- al. As part of a structured target agreement process, managers and employees jointly define the forthcom- ing tasks and expectations. Individual performance appraisals also have an impact on remuneration. A fur- ther purpose of career development discussions is to support our employees\u2019 development and career planning. These processes have been automated for 11 years through our HR Globe HR system and offer self-service features for employees and managers. A total of around 10,000 employees worldwide are reg- istered in the system. Over 35,000 employees have access to e-campus, our current learning management system, in which we offer training activities on special- ist and general work-related topics. We began working on the introduction of our new Workday HR system in a Group-wide project in 2021 with the intention of establishing it as the Group\u2019s central HR IT system worldwide.\nWorkday will gradually replace systems such as e-cam- pus and HR Globe. We laid the foundation with the global roll-out of Workday in December 2022. More than 45,000 employees are monitored with their HR master data in the system. The roll-out of further mod- ules is planned for 2023, including processes relating to talent management.\nMeasures and progress\nIn recent years, we have further developed our meas- ures aimed at promoting women. The proportion of women in programmes for the advancement of future executives across Germany was 31% (previous year: 31%) and therefore, as in previous years, significantly higher than the proportion of women in the total work- force in Germany of 16.9% (previous year: 15.9%). We also provide targeted support for the career develop- ment of our female future executives. In Germany, for example, we participate in a cross-company mentoring programme in cooperation with other companies from the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, where our head- quarters is located.\nThe global NOW \u2013 Network of Women, which was launched at Heidelberg Materials in 2011, connects female employees around the world virtually and in person and supports individual career development as well as promoting women in general. The initiative aims, among other things, to support the network\u2019s mem- bers in developing their career potential and to build greater awareness throughout the company of the changing demands on working and living environments. The Allies of NOW programme, introduced in 2021, also offers opportunities for male employees to advocate for gender equality at Heidelberg Materials.\nAs in previous years, Heidelberg Materials took part in activities for German Diversity Day in 2022.\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nThe steps taken in previous years regarding travel re- strictions and protective measures taken at individual locations in response to the coronavirus pandemic were adapted in the reporting year to the relevant local infection situations and regulations. Although many measures have been lifted altogether, some remain in many places because they have proven effective as preventive measures against other infectious diseases, such as flu. These include the increased provision of disinfectants, the installation of physical partitions, and more virtual meetings.\nIn 2022, we continued training our employees on a range of occupational safety topics, including both legally mandated and internally defined topics relating to key hazards that are relevant locally and across the Group. By doing so, we aim to increase awareness of risks and further reduce the number of accidents, es- pecially those resulting in fatalities.\nWe make use of conventional training in classrooms or on site in addition to e-learning courses, which are only ever used to supplement face-to-face training. Occu- pational safety topics account for around 55% of all training hours at Heidelberg Materials, corresponding to an average of approximately 15 hours per employee across the Group.\nIn addition to the conventional training activities, safe- ty conversations also play a central role as a preventive measure against accidents. During these conversa- tions between managers and employees, both safe and unsafe behaviour in the relevant situation are dis- cussed and, if necessary, safer procedures are agreed. In 2022, we asked managers to place a strong focus on conducting last-minute risk assessments in their safety conversations. Our analyses of the causes of accidents show that some accidents could have been prevented if an additional short risk assessment had been performed immediately before the work was car-\nHeidelberg Materials\n2022 124\n    ried out, i.e. at the last minute, taking into account fac- tors such as the current weather conditions or the health of the employees. By focusing more on this is- sue, we want to build greater awareness of this impor- tant preventive step on the part of both management and employees. We record the results of the safety conversations in HC Protect so that, for example, we can detect local pockets of unsafe behaviour. By carry- ing out regular safety inspections, we want to contrib- ute towards compliance with the defined safety re- quirements.\nPerformance indicators\nLost time injury frequency rate increased slightly in the reporting year to 1.7 (previous year: 1.6). The lost time injury severity rate, on the other hand, decreased sig- nificantly from 95 to 79. This development shows that on average we had fewer serious accidents with long periods of absence. The increased focus on conducting \u201clast minute\u201d risk assessments as a preventive measure is likely to have had a positive impact here. In the busi- ness year 2022, we had to mourn the death of one of our own employees and four employees of contractors lost their lives. In four cases, the accidents occurred during work to remedy unexpected disruptions in the operating process, and in another case there was a traffic accident in the quarry.\n\nAs a global Group, Heidelberg Materials is subject to a variety of legal requirements, which vary from country to country. In order to take account of these differenc- es and ensure corporate governance, we have imple- mented a compliance management system across the Group. Within this framework, we carry out compliance risk assessments every four years, most recently in 2020, and determine areas of focus for the content of the compliance programme. This is done by conducting structured interviews with the general managers of the country organisations and the Group directors. Com- pliance risk areas are identified and ranked. The risks in the topic areas of corruption, competition law, and human rights are among the ten most important risks that we mitigate by means of our compliance manage- ment system.\nCorruption topic area\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 business activity involves signif- icant cash flows, particularly in sales, procurement, financing, and investments, providing opportunities for corruption to occur in all countries of the world. Ac- cording to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index, many of the countries in which\n\nWe apply a zero tolerance policy to violations of appli- cable laws, regulations, and internal company policies. We also expect our employees and business partners worldwide to comply with key guidelines and recom- mendations, such as the principles of the eight core labour standards of the International Labour Organi- zation (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational En- terprises, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. All suppliers are also obli- gated to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct.\nOur management and monitoring structures are regu- lated in the company\u2019s Articles of Association, the\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 125\n    Rules of Procedure of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and are in line with the German Corporate Governance Code (see Corporate Governance state- ment chapter).\nThe impacts of any new investment on our compliance management system and, in particular, our human rights obligations are also part of our due diligence process. Human rights and business considerations are both taken into account when making investment decisions.\nResponsibility and organisation\nThe compliance programme, which is anchored in the Group-wide management and supervisory structures, is part of our management culture. It comprises the entire compliance organisation within the Group, the set-up of guidelines, and the verification of compliance with these guidelines. The compliance management addresses all compliance topics that Heidelberg Materials has identified as relevant in the compliance risk assessment.\nThe compliance organisation is under the authority of the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the Director Group Legal & Compliance reports directly. Each country has its own compliance officer, who re- ports directly to the country manager and indirectly to the Group Compliance department. The Compliance function is also responsible for the compliance manage- ment system for human rights. In 2022, the Managing Board appointed a Group human rights officer. In order to implement the human rights compliance programme, two new positions have been created in the Group Compliance department with a focus on human rights expertise. The future incumbents will cover topics rang- ing from risk analysis to preventive and remedial meas- ures \u2013 in both their own business line and the supply chain. Since the end of 2022, a human rights coordina-\ntor has been responsible for human rights compliance management in each of the country organisations. In addition, the country organisations appoint environ- mental experts to assist human rights coordinators as partners in assessing and addressing human rights risks related to environmental aspects.\nPolicies\nOur compliance principles are laid down in the Code of Business Conduct, which covers all compliance topics identified as material for Heidelberg Materials. The or- ganisation of the compliance management system is defined in the internal Compliance Policy.\nIn 2022, we specified standardised rules for all govern- ance documents in a new framework policy. Against this background, several compliance policies have also been adjusted, such as our Group Compliance Incident Reporting & Case Management Guideline, which lays down the principles for reporting compliance issues, processing and investigating submitted complaints, and protecting those reporting the incidents.\nThe Group Anti-Corruption Guideline defines principles such as behaving with integrity towards business part- ners or avoiding conflicts of interest.\nAs regards competition law, the acceptable behaviour for Heidelberg Materials is derived firstly from the ap- plicable antitrust laws including relevant international regulations, such as the antitrust regulations in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. In its Code of Busi- ness Conduct and with the Group Competition Law Guideline, the content of which was also adjusted in 2022, plus the national antitrust law guidelines based on the latter, Heidelberg Materials has made an explic- it internal commitment to strict compliance with anti- trust laws, such as the prohibition of cartels and the abuse of a dominant market position, as well as with the rules of merger control.\n\nHeidelberg Materials\u2019 position on human rights is a commitment by the Group to respect human rights. Among other things, it addresses employees\u2019 working conditions, responsibility at our locations (including the rights of indigenous peoples), and the selection of sup- pliers and customers. The internal Guideline on Human Rights Compliance Management regulates the organi- sation and responsibilities associated with implement- ing compliance with human rights.\nProcesses\nThe compliance programme integrated across the Group serves as a cornerstone for achieving our com- pliance targets. A central element of this programme is the self-commitment made by the Group management not to tolerate violations of applicable laws and to im- pose sanctions. The programme also includes internal guidelines and measures that express the legal provi- sions in concrete terms. In addition, suitable corrective and preventive measures are taken to help prevent sim- ilar incidents in the future. Further to annual communi- cation of these guidelines, compliance letters and vid- eo messages are circulated to the workforce. Software is used for the administration of compliance tasks and reporting. The intention is that this will also replace the previous software for compliance risk assessments in 2023. Furthermore, we have established SpeakUp, a web- and telephone-based reporting system accessi- ble across the Group and also to people outside the organisation.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 126\n    As well as face-to-face training, employee training is also carried out online. The range of digital courses, which are mandatory for specified groups of employ- ees, covers topics such as the Code of Business Con- duct, competition law, and the prevention of corrup- tion. In order to achieve a 100% completion rate for all digital compliance training, we require the country managers to additionally report on training attend- ance to the responsible member of the Managing Board. The group of persons required to attend the on- line training courses includes, depending on the course, all employees who have a company email address or employees of specific departments and/or managers. The training courses are mandatory for new hires and are repeated every two years. In addition, training ses- sions are conducted on other compliance topics such as human rights or money laundering. They are carried out both at the request of specific departments and on the instructions of the Compliance function.\nThe entire compliance programme is continuously re- viewed for the need to adapt to current legal and social developments by keeping track of news and exchang- ing information with compliance experts, and is im- proved and further developed accordingly.\nGroup-wide implementation of the compliance pro- gramme is monitored by regular and special audits by Group Internal Audit as well as via half-yearly reporting by the Director Group Legal & Compliance to the Man- aging Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervi- sory Board. The latter monitors the effectiveness of the compliance programme and verifies in particular whether it adequately satisfies the legal requirements and recognised compliance standards. An additional quarterly report informs the Managing Board members with regional responsibility about the most important compliance incidents in their Group areas. Following the adequacy assessment of the compliance manage- ment system of HeidelbergCement AG carried out in\n2021 on the basis of the IDW PS980 auditing standard, which was confirmed without qualification of the audit opinion, the recommendations for improvement have either already been implemented in 2022 or are in im- plementation.\nApproximately every three years, we conduct a com- prehensive analysis to assess and prevent corruption risks and possible conflicts of interest. A rolling ap- proach ensures that different Group countries are an- alysed each year as part of this cycle. First, the poten- tial risks within a country organisation are assessed. Then, the measures already in place to limit these risks are evaluated, and finally, we examine whether further measures are needed. On the basis of this assessment, an action plan is drawn up for each country, and its implementation is monitored by the Group Legal & Compliance department.\nIn the area of competition law, we have a comprehen- sive reporting system on antitrust investigation pro- ceedings. An annual competition law update takes place at the level of the Managing Board and of the employees who report directly to the members of the Managing Board with responsibility for sales. Further- more, annual qualitative assessments of the antitrust risks take place in the countries. A regular external au- dit of the competition law compliance programme is conducted by a specialist law firm approximately every three years.\nWe have established management processes that allow us to exercise effective human rights due diligence and in our opinion meet the requirements of both the United Nations Guiding Principles and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG).\n\nCombined management report\nNon-financial statement\nIn our country organisations, we carry out human rights risk analyses, which are currently still scheduled to be repeated every three years. The exact timetable is agreed individually with each country organisation. From 2023, HeidelbergCement AG is required by law to carry out annual risk reviews. The process will consider risks relating to discrimination, child or forced labour, risks to freedom of association and collective bargain- ing, risks to fair and safe working conditions, to the right of peoples to self-determination, and to the rights of indigenous peoples. The analysis includes determin- ing potential risks from the perspective of different functions, such as production, procurement, or sales, as well as identifying existing measures and defining additional measures to be implemented. The commit- ment to human rights aspects as a central selection criterion for suppliers is driven forward by our supplier management system. This obliges our partners to commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which re- quires compliance with human rights due diligence ob- ligations as defined by the German LkSG, such as the prohibition of forced labour and rules on non-discrimi- nation.\nMeasures and progress\nNon-compliance with our guidelines by employees may result in disciplinary measures up to and including dis- missal. Violations of corruption or competition laws, human rights, or contractual agreements by third par- ties may result in their exclusion from conducting busi- ness with Heidelberg Materials or require them to meet certain test conditions.\nHeidelberg Materials 2022 127\n    Our SpeakUp reporting platform, helps us not only to track compliance violations, but also to improve our preventive measures. SpeakUp is publicised on the in- tranet, on the internet, and at the various locations by means of informative posters. To reinforce our efforts to combat corruption, the country organisations are working on the implementation of individual country measures that were defined as part of the corruption risk assessment. The same applies to competition law and the protection of human rights.\nIn 2022, the preventive activities of the compliance of- ficers once again placed great emphasis on compli- ance with the provisions of competition law and anti- corruption regulations. In order to implement the German LkSG, the compliance officers have intensified their cooperation with the Group department Group Procurement as part of the Responsible Procurement initiative. Other functions were made aware of their hu- man rights due diligence obligations via information events backed by appropriate training measures.\nAfter pandemic-related restrictions were lifted, more training measures could be carried out again in 2022, with virtual concepts continuing to dominate. Compli- ance audits by Group Internal Audit were carried out on-site again.\nEfforts to protect human rights at our own locations \u2013 with a focus on safe working conditions and anti- discrimination \u2013 and in the supply chain continued and were intensified by the new human rights compliance organisation described above and the Responsible Pro- curement initiative. In addition to training activities, this work included systematically assessing human rights risks on a country-by-country basis and compil- ing key indicators relating to human rights. The results were analysed jointly by the respective country organ- isation and the Group Compliance department. The implementation of the agreed action plans for further risk reduction was reviewed and reported to the re- sponsible member of the Managing Board.\nPerformance indicators\n\nAt the end of the reporting year, the compliance e-learning programmes assigned to employees across the Group, covering the Code of Business Conduct and anti-corruption issues, had completion rates of 94%10) and 95%10) respectively.\nElectronic training on antitrust law is additionally as- signed to employees who work in sales or procurement, have management responsibility, or otherwise have contact with competitors, customers, and suppliers, achieving a completion rate of 93%10) at the end of the reporting year. There were also other compliance ac- tivities in the area of antitrust law (seminars, lectures, and other measures).\nThe country organisations are required to report key figures, such as the number of compliance cases re- ported through the case management system that in- volve suspected human rights violations. Apart from cases on health and occupational safety, four cases of discrimination were reported in relation to human rights issues, one of which was confirmed, and seven cases of harassment, with four justified complaints. The con- firmed cases were responded to with sanctions and/or preventive measures.\n18\nOf the 233 incidents reported, around half proved to be unfounded, while for 20%, no final investigation result had been determined by the editorial deadline. For just under 28% of the incidents, the investigations revealed that they were at least partially substantiated. None of the substantiated incident reports had a material im- pact on the consolidated financial statements.\nFor all substantiated cases, measures were taken, ranging from root cause analysis, changes to policies and processes, and communication and training through to disciplinary action (such as a written warn- ing or dismissal). In 42% of the substantiated cases, sanctions are imposed and for 81% of these incidents, preventive measures are implemented.\n10) Since 2022, the training status of the persons to be trained at the end of the financial year has been reported over the two-year training repetition period.\n\n1. **Total Reported Incidents**: \n   - The infographic states that there were 233 incidents reported in the current year. For comparison, the previous year (2021) had 238 reported incidents, indicating a slight decrease in the number of reports.\n\n2. **Methods of Reporting**: \n   - The majority of the reports, 79%, were made through the \"SpeakUp\" compliance reporting system, which seems to be a dedicated platform for reporting compliance-related incidents within the organization.\n   - Of these reports made via the SpeakUp system:\n     - 78% were submitted online.\n     - 22% were made via telephone, highlighting a significant preference for digital reporting over phone calls.\n   - Additionally, 21% of the reports were submitted through more traditional means such as emails or letters, showing that a portion of the workforce still uses conventional communication methods for reporting.\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.
