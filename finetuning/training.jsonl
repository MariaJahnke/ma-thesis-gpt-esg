The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current legislative changes as well as\nopportunities for external training and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature.\nIn this regard, the Supervisory Board has also examined in detail the latest developments in corporate\ngovernance, especially the new requirements of the Code 2022 and the sustainability issues relevant to\nadidas.\nMoreover, the Supervisory Board as well as the Audit Committee, General Committee, and Nomination\nCommittee regularly assess the efficiency of their work. As the improvement measures for increasing the\nefficiency of the Supervisory Board\u2019s work resolved upon in 2020 were deemed to have been implemented\nsuccessfully in the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory Board conducted another efficiency examination of\nits work in October 2022 and concluded that the Supervisory Board as a whole as well as its respective\ncommittees are efficient, and resolved upon specific measures to further improve the organization of the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s work.\nThe compensation of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the Compensation Report.\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nSupervisory Board of adidas AG must be composed of at least five women and five men.

Substantial transactions between the company and\nmembers of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board\napproval. Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require\nSupervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the\nhandling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting. In the year under review, the members of the Executive\nBoard and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest. A brand\nambassador agreement exists between adidas AG and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The Supervisory Board is of\nthe opinion that this does not constitute a conflict of interest. In particular, the brand ambassador\nagreement does not represent a material business relationship for either adidas or Jackie Joyner-Kersee.\nThe Supervisory Board passed a unanimous resolution approving this agreement without the participation\nof Jackie Joyner-Kersee. \u25ba SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT\nSHARE TRANSACTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD\nAn overview of the transactions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board pursuant to Article(3031)19 of\nthe Regulation (EU) No(3031)596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation) notified to adidas(3031)AG in 2022 is published on\nour website. \u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/MANAGERS-TRANSACTIONS\nRELEVANT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\nOur business activities are aligned with the legal systems of the various countries and markets in which\nwe operate.

Our Compliance Management System is linked to the company\u2019s Internal\nControl and Risk Management System.

Where we have a presence in so-called low-tax jurisdictions, this is related to our\nbusiness activities in those jurisdictions and is not created for the purpose of minimizing our tax burden.\nWhile tax is among the many considerations in making business decisions, it is not the main driver in our\n\u00ac\ndecision-making process.\nTax management and governance\n\u2310\nGiven the range of activities and locations we operate in, adidas is subject to a wide range of taxes\nacross the world, including corporate income tax, VAT/GST, employee-related taxes such as payroll and\nfringe benefit tax, withholding taxes, property taxes, stamp duties, and other taxes. The purpose of our tax\nfunction is to support and enable business objectives while ensuring compliance and preventing or\nminimizing tax risks.\nThe approach to tax is defined by the Vice President Corporate Tax and is reflected in the tax strategy,\nobjectives, policies, and internal controls. Economic and social impacts are considered in developing and\nexecuting our tax strategy. The Corporate Tax team reviews our tax strategy on an annual basis, with\nsignificant changes being approved by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

We believe adidas Fair Play will prevent a majority of potential compliance issues.\nFor that reason, we have specific measures to detect and respond to any concerns. We realize, however,\nthat no compliance system can eliminate all violations.\nThe adidas Chief Compliance Officer oversees the company\u2019s Compliance Management System (CMS). We\nsee compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain.\nOur central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance\nOfficers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis. In addition, the\ncentral Compliance team regularly conducts compliance reviews within selected entities.\nThe company\u2019s CMS is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. It refers to the OECD\nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises and is designed to:\n(6827) support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable growth through good corporate governance,\n(6827) reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage caused by non-compliant conduct,\n(6827) protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the company and its brand through compliant\nconduct, and\n(6827) support \u2018Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u2019 (\u2018DEI\u2019) initiatives by fighting harassment and discrimination.\n163 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nThe adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct is accessible on our website, includes guidelines for employee\nbehavior in everyday work, and is applicable globally for all business areas. In 2020, we revised the Code of\n\u00ac\nConduct to ensure it remains up to date and reflects our business environment.\n\u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CODE-OF-CONDUCT\n\u2310\nThe Fair Play Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect, and\nrespond.\n(6827) Prevention: The Compliance team regularly reviews and updates the CMS as necessary. In addition to\nthe revised Fair Play Code of Conduct mentioned above, we also support all initiatives to prevent and\nfight harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Management also shares compliance-related\ncommunication, and the Compliance department provides mandatory training to all employees globally\nduring onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles. The Compliance team and partners also provide\ntargeted in-person compliance training as appropriate with senior management and newly promoted\nor hired senior executives across the globe in order to further enhance the compliance \u2018tone from the\ntop,\u2019 as well as the \u2018tone from the middle.\u2019 We closely monitor the completion rates for these training\nmeasures. We also focused on further enhancing cooperation between the Compliance team and the\nInternal Audit, the Group Policies and Internal Controls, and the Risk Management department.\n(6827) Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures in place to ensure timely detection of potential\ninfringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. Employees can report compliance\nconcerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers\nor Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or, where applicable, the Works Council.\nEmployees can also report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website,\nwhich also allow for anonymous complaints. The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times\nworldwide, including the services of interpreters, if required. They are promoted digitally and with\nposters to reach all our locations around the world. The company\u2019s work to identify potential\ncompliance violations continued in 2022.\n(6827) Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. The Chief\nCompliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional\nCompliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers. We track, monitor, and\nreport potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide. In 2022, we recorded 521 potential compliance\nviolations (2021: 485). Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are\nused to continuously improve the CMS. Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance\nviolations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of\nemployment contracts. In addition, in 2022, the Compliance team strengthened its relationship with the\nEmployee Relations (ER) organization, a key partner in many compliance matters, especially those\nrelated to harassment and discrimination.\nPOTENTIAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS\n\nMalfeasance, including conflicts of interest and corruption 1cases in 2022 and 2021 9 21\n\n\nAnonymous contact to hotline 55 in 2022 and 47 in 2021\nNamed contact to hotline 26 30 in 2022 and 2021\nCompliance Officer and other 18 23 in 2022 and in 2021\nThe company\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer regularly reports to the Executive Board on the further\ndevelopment of the compliance program and on major compliance cases. In addition, the Chief\nCompliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. In 2022, the Chief Compliance\nOfficer attended four meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to report on the further\ndevelopment of the compliance program, major compliance cases, and other relevant compliance topics.\nThe Compliance department has revised its process for detecting compliance risks and included new\nrisks, as well as captured some risk areas (e.g., e-commerce) more clearly. In addition, the description of\n\u00ac\nthe CMS has been sharpened.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROCESS\nPURSUANT TO \u00a7 315 SECTION 4 GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HANDELSGESETZBUCH \u2013 HGB)\nThe accounting-related internal control and risk management system of the company represents a\nprocess embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system. It aims to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the company\u2019s external financial reporting by ensuring company-\nwide compliance with statutory accounting regulations, in particular the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance Manual). We regard the\ninternal control and risk management system as a process based on the principle of segregation of duties,\nencompassing various sub-processes in the areas of Accounting, Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Planning,\nReporting, and Legal, focusing on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of\nfinancial reporting risks. Clearly defined responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process. In a\nfirst step, the internal control and risk management system serves to identify, assess, limit, and control\nrisks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process that might result in the consolidated\nfinancial statements not being compliant with internal and external regulations.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To monitor the\neffectiveness of ICoFR, the Group Policies and Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit\ndepartment regularly review accounting-related processes. Additionally, as part of the year-end audit, the\nexternal auditor assesses the effectiveness of selected internal controls, including IT controls. The Audit\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR.\nAll adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance\nManual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the\ncompany-wide intranet. We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory\nchanges and internal developments. Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all\nadidas companies. Clear policies serve to limit employees\u2019 scope of discretion with regard to recognition\nand valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within\nthe company. We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the\nfour-eyes principle in accounting-related processes. In addition, the local manager responsible for the\naccounting-related process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director\nconfirm adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting\ndepartment semi-annually.\n165 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nThe accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services.\nVirtually all the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide\nstandardized SAP system. Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company,\nthe local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS.\nAt the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by adidas\ncompanies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments. These reviews include automated\nvalidations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and\nadherence to the reporting logic. In addition, differences between current-year and prior-year financial\ndata as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level. If necessary, adidas seeks the opinion of\nindependent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a non-routine basis.\nAfter ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation process begins,\nrunning automatically on SAP SEM-BCS. Controls within the individual consolidation steps, such as those\nrelating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are conducted both manually and system-\nbased, using automatically created consolidation logs. Any inadequacies are remedied manually by\nsystematically processing the individual errors as well as differences and are reported back to the adidas\ncompanies. After finalization of all consolidation steps, all items in the consolidated income statement and\nin the consolidated statement of financial position are analyzed with respect to trends and variances.\nUnless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies are asked to explain any identified material\ndeviations.\nAll financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization\nconcepts, approval concepts, and access restrictions. Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular\nbasis and updated if required. The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is\nminimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of\nchange processes, and regular data backups.\nFurthermore, the adidas internal control and risk management system includes non-accounting-related\ncontrols which serve to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of\noperations, reliability of non-financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The\ninternal control and risk management system regarding the non-accounting-related activities focuses also\non the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of relevant risks. It is as well\nembedded within the company-wide corporate governance system and encompasses various sub-\nprocesses in the areas of Brands, Operations (including Procurement and IT), Sales, or Human Resources.\nAll adidas companies are also required to comply with the non-accounting-related policies (\u2018Policy\nManual\u2019), which are available to all employees involved in the various processes through the company-\nwide intranet and are updated and communicated on a regular basis.\nThe effectiveness of the non-accounting-related controls is also regularly monitored by the Group Policies\nand Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit department. The reporting of internal control\nresults to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board includes the effectiveness of non-accounting-\nrelated controls as well.\nNothing came to our attention that would cause us to doubt the appropriateness and effectiveness of the\nentire internal control and risk management system. However, due to the limitations of any internal\ncontrol and risk management system, absolute certainty about the appropriateness and effectiveness of\nthese systems cannot be guaranteed.31\n31 The statement in relation to German Corporate Governance Code A5 was not audited in terms of content as part of the audit of this Group Management\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nperformance. In addition, global competition for highly qualified personnel remains fierce. As a result, the\nloss of key personnel in strategic positions and the inability to identify, recruit, and retain highly qualified\nand skilled talent who best meet the specific needs of our company pose risks to our business\nperformance.\nWe are taking various measures to ensure that we maintain a culture that fosters \u2018DEI.\u2019 Through several\nspecialized programs, \u2018DEI\u2019 is embedded into our recruitment processes. Our \u2018Global DEI Council\u2019 drives\nthe increase of representation, retention, and advancement of diverse talents within our global workforce.\nFurthermore, our workforce takes part in \u2018DEI\u2019 learning programs. To ensure effective leadership across\nthe company we offer a portfolio of leadership development experiences designed for every level of\nmanagement across all markets and functions. To optimize staffing levels and resource allocation (i.e.,\nhaving the right people with the right skillsets in the right roles at the right time), we adjust resource\nallocation where required to reflect developments in business performance, the economic environment\nand our company\u2019s strategic priorities. Organizational transformations and reorganizations are supported\nby change activations with our leadership teams and organizational design consultancy. We continuously\ninvest in improving employer branding activities, and our global recruiting organization constantly\nenhances our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities. Our global succession\nmanagement helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and therefore reduces\nsuccession risk.\nRISKS RELATED TO MEDIA AND STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES\nAdverse or inaccurate media coverage on our products or business practices as well as negative social\nmedia discussion may significantly harm adidas\u2019 reputation and brand image, lead to public misperception\nof the company\u2019s business performance and eventually result in a sales slowdown. Similarly, certain\nactivities on the part of key stakeholders (e.g., non-governmental organizations, governmental institutions)\ncould cause reputational damage, distract top management, and disrupt business activities. Despite the\ntermination of the adidas Yeezy partnership in 2022, due to its former size and relevance, related\nstakeholder reactions and negative media coverage could still be possible.\nTo mitigate these risks, we pursue proactive, open communication and engagement with key stakeholders\n(e.g., consumers, media, the financial community, non-governmental organizations, governmental\ninstitutions) on a continuous basis. In addition, we have established clear crisis communication processes\nto ensure a quick and effective response to adverse developments. We have also strengthened social\nmedia capabilities and created various digital newsrooms around the globe that enable continuous\nmonitoring of social media content related to the company\u2019s products and activities and allow early\nmanagement of potentially damaging social media discussion. On a case-by-case basis, we seek external\nadvice from experts in communication and stakeholder management.\nIT AND CYBER SECURITY RISKS\nTheft, leakage, corruption, or unavailability of critical information (e.g., consumer data, employee data,\nproduct data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, or the inability to\nperform key business processes. Key business processes, including product marketing, order\nmanagement, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support, and financial reporting, are\nall dependent on IT systems. Significant outages, application failures, or cyber security threats to our\ninfrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in reputational damage, regulatory\npenalties, or cause considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data.\nTo mitigate these risks, our IT organization proactively engages in system preventive maintenance, service\ncontinuity planning, adherence to IT policies and maintenance of a comprehensive information security\nprogram. Information security governance, data security, security architecture design, continuity\n\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nmanagement, and employee awareness programs help us to protect the company adequately. We have\nalso secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cyber security incidents.\nBUSINESS PARTNER RISKS\nadidas interacts and enters into partnerships with various third parties, such as athletes, creative\npartners, innovation partners, retail partners, or suppliers of goods or services. As a result, the company\nis exposed to a multitude of business partner risks.\nWe work with strategic partners in various areas of our business (e.g., product creation, manufacturing,\nresearch, and development) or distributors in a few selected markets whose approach might differ from\nour own business practices and standards, which could also negatively impact the company\u2019s business\nperformance and reputation. Similarly, failure to maintain strong relationships with our partners could\nnegatively impact the company\u2019s sales and profitability. Risks may also arise from a dependency on\nparticular partners. For example, the overdependency on a supplier or customer increases the company\u2019s\nvulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls, respectively, and could lead to significant margin pressure.\nBusiness partner default (including insolvency) or other disruptive events such as strikes may negatively\naffect the company\u2019s business activities and result in additional costs and liabilities as well as lower sales\nfor the company. Unethical business practices or improper behavior on the part of business partners could\nhave a negative spillover effect on the company\u2019s reputation, lead to higher costs or liabilities or even\ndisrupt business activities.\nTo mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally\ninclude clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our\npartnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of\npromotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners.\nWe utilize a broad distribution strategy, which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer\nbusiness to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted\nfor more than 5% of the company\u2019s sales in 2022. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with\nsuppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality, and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any\npotential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we\nenforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and\nenvironmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance\ncoverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers\u2019 premises. To\nreduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas\nworks with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products,\ndoes not have a single-sourcing model.\nCOMPLIANCE RISKS\nAs a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations. Non-compliance with\nsuch laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause reputational damage. For example,\nnon-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, such as the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR), may result in substantial fines. In addition, publication of failure to\ncomply with data protection and privacy regulations could cause reputational damage and result in a loss\nof consumer trust in our brands. We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our\nemployees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior. This\nincludes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices,\nbribery, corruption, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace.\nOur Compliance Management System (CMS) helps us to prevent, detect, and adequately respond to these\nrisks.

The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current legislative changes as well as\nopportunities for external training and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature.\nIn this regard, the Supervisory Board has also examined in detail the latest developments in corporate\ngovernance, especially the new requirements of the Code 2022 and the sustainability issues relevant to\nadidas.\nMoreover, the Supervisory Board as well as the Audit Committee, General Committee, and Nomination\nCommittee regularly assess the efficiency of their work. As the improvement measures for increasing the\nefficiency of the Supervisory Board\u2019s work resolved upon in 2020 were deemed to have been implemented\nsuccessfully in the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory Board conducted another efficiency examination of\nits work in October 2022 and concluded that the Supervisory Board as a whole as well as its respective\ncommittees are efficient, and resolved upon specific measures to further improve the organization of the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s work.\nThe compensation of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the Compensation Report.\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nSupervisory Board of adidas AG must be composed of at least five women and five men.

Substantial transactions between the company and\nmembers of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board\napproval. Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require\nSupervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the\nhandling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting. In the year under review, the members of the Executive\nBoard and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest. A brand\nambassador agreement exists between adidas AG and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The Supervisory Board is of\nthe opinion that this does not constitute a conflict of interest. In particular, the brand ambassador\nagreement does not represent a material business relationship for either adidas or Jackie Joyner-Kersee.\nThe Supervisory Board passed a unanimous resolution approving this agreement without the participation\nof Jackie Joyner-Kersee. \u25ba SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT\nSHARE TRANSACTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD\nAn overview of the transactions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board pursuant to Article(3031)19 of\nthe Regulation (EU) No(3031)596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation) notified to adidas(3031)AG in 2022 is published on\nour website. \u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/MANAGERS-TRANSACTIONS\nRELEVANT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\nOur business activities are aligned with the legal systems of the various countries and markets in which\nwe operate.

Our Compliance Management System is linked to the company\u2019s Internal\nControl and Risk Management System.

Where we have a presence in so-called low-tax jurisdictions, this is related to our\nbusiness activities in those jurisdictions and is not created for the purpose of minimizing our tax burden.\nWhile tax is among the many considerations in making business decisions, it is not the main driver in our\n\u00ac\ndecision-making process.\nTax management and governance\n\u2310\nGiven the range of activities and locations we operate in, adidas is subject to a wide range of taxes\nacross the world, including corporate income tax, VAT/GST, employee-related taxes such as payroll and\nfringe benefit tax, withholding taxes, property taxes, stamp duties, and other taxes. The purpose of our tax\nfunction is to support and enable business objectives while ensuring compliance and preventing or\nminimizing tax risks.\nThe approach to tax is defined by the Vice President Corporate Tax and is reflected in the tax strategy,\nobjectives, policies, and internal controls. Economic and social impacts are considered in developing and\nexecuting our tax strategy. The Corporate Tax team reviews our tax strategy on an annual basis, with\nsignificant changes being approved by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

To further improve the risk culture at adidas, we are also offering a risk management\ntraining to all our employees through our company intranet.\nCOMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ADIDAS FAIR PLAY)\n\u2310\nWe consider compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations to be imperative.\nThe Executive Board sets the tone from the top, and every employee is required to act ethically and in\ncompliance with the law as well as with internal and other external regulations while executing the\ncompany\u2019s business. We believe adidas Fair Play will prevent a majority of potential compliance issues.\nFor that reason, we have specific measures to detect and respond to any concerns. We realize, however,\nthat no compliance system can eliminate all violations.\nThe adidas Chief Compliance Officer oversees the company\u2019s Compliance Management System (CMS). We\nsee compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain.\nOur central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance\nOfficers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis. In addition, the\ncentral Compliance team regularly conducts compliance reviews within selected entities.\nThe company\u2019s CMS is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. It refers to the OECD\nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises and is designed to:\n(6827) support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable growth through good corporate governance,\n(6827) reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage caused by non-compliant conduct,\n(6827) protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the company and its brand through compliant\nconduct, and\n(6827) support \u2018Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u2019 (\u2018DEI\u2019) initiatives by fighting harassment and discrimination.\n163 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nThe adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct is accessible on our website, includes guidelines for employee\nbehavior in everyday work, and is applicable globally for all business areas. In 2020, we revised the Code of\n\u00ac\nConduct to ensure it remains up to date and reflects our business environment.\n\u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CODE-OF-CONDUCT\n\u2310\nThe Fair Play Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect, and\nrespond.\n(6827) Prevention: The Compliance team regularly reviews and updates the CMS as necessary. In addition to\nthe revised Fair Play Code of Conduct mentioned above, we also support all initiatives to prevent and\nfight harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Management also shares compliance-related\ncommunication, and the Compliance department provides mandatory training to all employees globally\nduring onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles. The Compliance team and partners also provide\ntargeted in-person compliance training as appropriate with senior management and newly promoted\nor hired senior executives across the globe in order to further enhance the compliance \u2018tone from the\ntop,\u2019 as well as the \u2018tone from the middle.\u2019 We closely monitor the completion rates for these training\nmeasures. We also focused on further enhancing cooperation between the Compliance team and the\nInternal Audit, the Group Policies and Internal Controls, and the Risk Management department.\n(6827) Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures in place to ensure timely detection of potential\ninfringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. Employees can report compliance\nconcerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers\nor Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or, where applicable, the Works Council.\nEmployees can also report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website,\nwhich also allow for anonymous complaints. The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times\nworldwide, including the services of interpreters, if required. They are promoted digitally and with\nposters to reach all our locations around the world. The company\u2019s work to identify potential\ncompliance violations continued in 2022.\n(6827) Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. The Chief\nCompliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional\nCompliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers. We track, monitor, and\nreport potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide. In 2022, we recorded 521 potential compliance\nviolations (2021: 485). Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are\nused to continuously improve the CMS. Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance\nviolations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of\nemployment contracts. In addition, in 2022, the Compliance team strengthened its relationship with the\nEmployee Relations (ER) organization, a key partner in many compliance matters, especially those\nrelated to harassment and discrimination.\nPOTENTIAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS\n\nMalfeasance, including conflicts of interest and corruption 1cases in 2022 and 2021 9 21\n\n\nAnonymous contact to hotline 55 in 2022 and 47 in 2021\nNamed contact to hotline 26 30 in 2022 and 2021\nCompliance Officer and other 18 23 in 2022 and in 2021\nThe company\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer regularly reports to the Executive Board on the further\ndevelopment of the compliance program and on major compliance cases. In addition, the Chief\nCompliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. In 2022, the Chief Compliance\nOfficer attended four meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to report on the further\ndevelopment of the compliance program, major compliance cases, and other relevant compliance topics.\nThe Compliance department has revised its process for detecting compliance risks and included new\nrisks, as well as captured some risk areas (e.g., e-commerce) more clearly. In addition, the description of\n\u00ac\nthe CMS has been sharpened.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROCESS\nPURSUANT TO \u00a7 315 SECTION 4 GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HANDELSGESETZBUCH \u2013 HGB)\nThe accounting-related internal control and risk management system of the company represents a\nprocess embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system. It aims to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the company\u2019s external financial reporting by ensuring company-\nwide compliance with statutory accounting regulations, in particular the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance Manual). We regard the\ninternal control and risk management system as a process based on the principle of segregation of duties,\nencompassing various sub-processes in the areas of Accounting, Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Planning,\nReporting, and Legal, focusing on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of\nfinancial reporting risks. Clearly defined responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process. In a\nfirst step, the internal control and risk management system serves to identify, assess, limit, and control\nrisks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process that might result in the consolidated\nfinancial statements not being compliant with internal and external regulations.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To monitor the\neffectiveness of ICoFR, the Group Policies and Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit\ndepartment regularly review accounting-related processes. Additionally, as part of the year-end audit, the\nexternal auditor assesses the effectiveness of selected internal controls, including IT controls. The Audit\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR.\nAll adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance\nManual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the\ncompany-wide intranet. We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory\nchanges and internal developments. Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all\nadidas companies. Clear policies serve to limit employees\u2019 scope of discretion with regard to recognition\nand valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within\nthe company. We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the\nfour-eyes principle in accounting-related processes. In addition, the local manager responsible for the\naccounting-related process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director\nconfirm adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting\ndepartment semi-annually.\n165 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nThe accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services.\nVirtually all the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide\nstandardized SAP system. Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company,\nthe local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS.\nAt the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by adidas\ncompanies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments. These reviews include automated\nvalidations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and\nadherence to the reporting logic. In addition, differences between current-year and prior-year financial\ndata as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level. If necessary, adidas seeks the opinion of\nindependent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a non-routine basis.\nAfter ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation process begins,\nrunning automatically on SAP SEM-BCS. Controls within the individual consolidation steps, such as those\nrelating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are conducted both manually and system-\nbased, using automatically created consolidation logs. Any inadequacies are remedied manually by\nsystematically processing the individual errors as well as differences and are reported back to the adidas\ncompanies. After finalization of all consolidation steps, all items in the consolidated income statement and\nin the consolidated statement of financial position are analyzed with respect to trends and variances.\nUnless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies are asked to explain any identified material\ndeviations.\nAll financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization\nconcepts, approval concepts, and access restrictions. Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular\nbasis and updated if required. The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is\nminimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of\nchange processes, and regular data backups.\nFurthermore, the adidas internal control and risk management system includes non-accounting-related\ncontrols which serve to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of\noperations, reliability of non-financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The\ninternal control and risk management system regarding the non-accounting-related activities focuses also\non the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of relevant risks. It is as well\nembedded within the company-wide corporate governance system and encompasses various sub-\nprocesses in the areas of Brands, Operations (including Procurement and IT), Sales, or Human Resources.\nAll adidas companies are also required to comply with the non-accounting-related policies (\u2018Policy\nManual\u2019), which are available to all employees involved in the various processes through the company-\nwide intranet and are updated and communicated on a regular basis.\nThe effectiveness of the non-accounting-related controls is also regularly monitored by the Group Policies\nand Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit department. The reporting of internal control\nresults to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board includes the effectiveness of non-accounting-\nrelated controls as well.\nNothing came to our attention that would cause us to doubt the appropriateness and effectiveness of the\nentire internal control and risk management system. However, due to the limitations of any internal\ncontrol and risk management system, absolute certainty about the appropriateness and effectiveness of\nthese systems cannot be guaranteed.31\n31 The statement in relation to German Corporate Governance Code A5 was not audited in terms of content as part of the audit of this Group Management\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nperformance. In addition, global competition for highly qualified personnel remains fierce. As a result, the\nloss of key personnel in strategic positions and the inability to identify, recruit, and retain highly qualified\nand skilled talent who best meet the specific needs of our company pose risks to our business\nperformance.\nWe are taking various measures to ensure that we maintain a culture that fosters \u2018DEI.\u2019 Through several\nspecialized programs, \u2018DEI\u2019 is embedded into our recruitment processes. Our \u2018Global DEI Council\u2019 drives\nthe increase of representation, retention, and advancement of diverse talents within our global workforce.\nFurthermore, our workforce takes part in \u2018DEI\u2019 learning programs. To ensure effective leadership across\nthe company we offer a portfolio of leadership development experiences designed for every level of\nmanagement across all markets and functions. To optimize staffing levels and resource allocation (i.e.,\nhaving the right people with the right skillsets in the right roles at the right time), we adjust resource\nallocation where required to reflect developments in business performance, the economic environment\nand our company\u2019s strategic priorities. Organizational transformations and reorganizations are supported\nby change activations with our leadership teams and organizational design consultancy. We continuously\ninvest in improving employer branding activities, and our global recruiting organization constantly\nenhances our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities. Our global succession\nmanagement helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and therefore reduces\nsuccession risk.\nRISKS RELATED TO MEDIA AND STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES\nAdverse or inaccurate media coverage on our products or business practices as well as negative social\nmedia discussion may significantly harm adidas\u2019 reputation and brand image, lead to public misperception\nof the company\u2019s business performance and eventually result in a sales slowdown. Similarly, certain\nactivities on the part of key stakeholders (e.g., non-governmental organizations, governmental institutions)\ncould cause reputational damage, distract top management, and disrupt business activities. Despite the\ntermination of the adidas Yeezy partnership in 2022, due to its former size and relevance, related\nstakeholder reactions and negative media coverage could still be possible.\nTo mitigate these risks, we pursue proactive, open communication and engagement with key stakeholders\n(e.g., consumers, media, the financial community, non-governmental organizations, governmental\ninstitutions) on a continuous basis. In addition, we have established clear crisis communication processes\nto ensure a quick and effective response to adverse developments. We have also strengthened social\nmedia capabilities and created various digital newsrooms around the globe that enable continuous\nmonitoring of social media content related to the company\u2019s products and activities and allow early\nmanagement of potentially damaging social media discussion. On a case-by-case basis, we seek external\nadvice from experts in communication and stakeholder management.\nIT AND CYBER SECURITY RISKS\nTheft, leakage, corruption, or unavailability of critical information (e.g., consumer data, employee data,\nproduct data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, or the inability to\nperform key business processes. Key business processes, including product marketing, order\nmanagement, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support, and financial reporting, are\nall dependent on IT systems. Significant outages, application failures, or cyber security threats to our\ninfrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in reputational damage, regulatory\npenalties, or cause considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data.\nTo mitigate these risks, our IT organization proactively engages in system preventive maintenance, service\ncontinuity planning, adherence to IT policies and maintenance of a comprehensive information security\nprogram. Information security governance, data security, security architecture design, continuity\n\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nmanagement, and employee awareness programs help us to protect the company adequately. We have\nalso secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cyber security incidents.\nBUSINESS PARTNER RISKS\nadidas interacts and enters into partnerships with various third parties, such as athletes, creative\npartners, innovation partners, retail partners, or suppliers of goods or services. As a result, the company\nis exposed to a multitude of business partner risks.\nWe work with strategic partners in various areas of our business (e.g., product creation, manufacturing,\nresearch, and development) or distributors in a few selected markets whose approach might differ from\nour own business practices and standards, which could also negatively impact the company\u2019s business\nperformance and reputation. Similarly, failure to maintain strong relationships with our partners could\nnegatively impact the company\u2019s sales and profitability. Risks may also arise from a dependency on\nparticular partners. For example, the overdependency on a supplier or customer increases the company\u2019s\nvulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls, respectively, and could lead to significant margin pressure.\nBusiness partner default (including insolvency) or other disruptive events such as strikes may negatively\naffect the company\u2019s business activities and result in additional costs and liabilities as well as lower sales\nfor the company. Unethical business practices or improper behavior on the part of business partners could\nhave a negative spillover effect on the company\u2019s reputation, lead to higher costs or liabilities or even\ndisrupt business activities.\nTo mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally\ninclude clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our\npartnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of\npromotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners.\nWe utilize a broad distribution strategy, which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer\nbusiness to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted\nfor more than 5% of the company\u2019s sales in 2022. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with\nsuppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality, and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any\npotential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we\nenforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and\nenvironmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance\ncoverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers\u2019 premises. To\nreduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas\nworks with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products,\ndoes not have a single-sourcing model.\nCOMPLIANCE RISKS\nAs a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations. Non-compliance with\nsuch laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause reputational damage. For example,\nnon-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, such as the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR), may result in substantial fines. In addition, publication of failure to\ncomply with data protection and privacy regulations could cause reputational damage and result in a loss\nof consumer trust in our brands. We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our\nemployees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior. This\nincludes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices,\nbribery, corruption, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace.\nOur Compliance Management System (CMS) helps us to prevent, detect, and adequately respond to these\nrisks.

The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current legislative changes as well as\nopportunities for external training and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature.\nIn this regard, the Supervisory Board has also examined in detail the latest developments in corporate\ngovernance, especially the new requirements of the Code 2022 and the sustainability issues relevant to\nadidas.\nMoreover, the Supervisory Board as well as the Audit Committee, General Committee, and Nomination\nCommittee regularly assess the efficiency of their work. As the improvement measures for increasing the\nefficiency of the Supervisory Board\u2019s work resolved upon in 2020 were deemed to have been implemented\nsuccessfully in the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory Board conducted another efficiency examination of\nits work in October 2022 and concluded that the Supervisory Board as a whole as well as its respective\ncommittees are efficient, and resolved upon specific measures to further improve the organization of the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s work.\nThe compensation of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the Compensation Report.\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nSupervisory Board of adidas AG must be composed of at least five women and five men. These minimum\nquotas were achieved. As at December 31, 2022, six of the company\u2019s 16 Supervisory Board mandates\nwere held by women.\nWithin the framework of the employee strategy already launched in 2021, the company will continue to\nintensify its efforts for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in order to remain an attractive employer in the\nfuture. There will be a particular focus on a long-term approach to equity in leadership positions \u2013 both\nthrough hiring and through appropriate succession planning. \u25ba SEE OUR PEOPLE\nAVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nThe members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are obligated to disclose any conflicts of\ninterest to the Supervisory Board without delay. Substantial transactions between the company and\nmembers of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board\napproval. Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require\nSupervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the\nhandling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting. In the year under review, the members of the Executive\nBoard and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest. A brand\nambassador agreement exists between adidas AG and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The Supervisory Board is of\nthe opinion that this does not constitute a conflict of interest. In particular, the brand ambassador\nagreement does not represent a material business relationship for either adidas or Jackie Joyner-Kersee.\nThe Supervisory Board passed a unanimous resolution approving this agreement without the participation\nof Jackie Joyner-Kersee. \u25ba SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT\nSHARE TRANSACTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD\nAn overview of the transactions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board pursuant to Article(3031)19 of\nthe Regulation (EU) No(3031)596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation) notified to adidas(3031)AG in 2022 is published on\nour website. \u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/MANAGERS-TRANSACTIONS\nRELEVANT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\nOur business activities are aligned with the legal systems of the various countries and markets in which\nwe operate. We are also aware of our considerable social and environmental responsibility.\nWe will significantly increase our commitment to sustainability in the years ahead. In addition to the\ncontinued digital transformation of the company, we are working closely with our partners in the global\nsupply chain to reduce energy consumption and increase the proportion of green energy we use. By 2025,\nnine out of every ten adidas articles should be made from more sustainable materials, while the carbon\nfootprint per product should be reduced by 15% in comparison to baseline year 2017. adidas aims for\nclimate-neutral operation at its locations by 2025 and to reach complete climate neutrality by 2050.\nFurther information on company-specific practices, which are applied in addition to statutory\nrequirements, such as our Code of Conduct (\u2018Fair Play\u2019), on compliance with working and social standards\nwithin our supply chain, environmentally friendly resource management in our manufacturing processes,\nand our social commitment is available in this Annual Report and on our website. \u25ba SEE OUR PEOPLE\n\u25ba SEE SUSTAINABILITY \u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/SUSTAINABILITY\nCOMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance with laws, internal and external provisions, and responsible risk management are part of\ncorporate governance at adidas. Our Compliance Management System is linked to the company\u2019s Internal\nControl and Risk Management System. As part of our global \u2018Fair Play\u2019 concept, the Compliance\nManagement System establishes the organizational framework for companywide awareness of our\ninternal rules and guidelines and for the legally compliant conduct of our business. It underscores our\n\nWe are committed to being compliant with all tax regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe consider the interests of our stakeholders in the business decisions we make in order to ensure the\nlasting success of our company.\nWe do not operate through artificial structures or structure our business in ways that are intended to\nresult in tax avoidance. Where we have a presence in so-called low-tax jurisdictions, this is related to our\nbusiness activities in those jurisdictions and is not created for the purpose of minimizing our tax burden.\nWhile tax is among the many considerations in making business decisions, it is not the main driver in our\n\u00ac\ndecision-making process.\nTax management and governance\n\u2310\nGiven the range of activities and locations we operate in, adidas is subject to a wide range of taxes\nacross the world, including corporate income tax, VAT/GST, employee-related taxes such as payroll and\nfringe benefit tax, withholding taxes, property taxes, stamp duties, and other taxes. The purpose of our tax\nfunction is to support and enable business objectives while ensuring compliance and preventing or\nminimizing tax risks.\nThe approach to tax is defined by the Vice President Corporate Tax and is reflected in the tax strategy,\nobjectives, policies, and internal controls. Economic and social impacts are considered in developing and\nexecuting our tax strategy. The Corporate Tax team reviews our tax strategy on an annual basis, with\nsignificant changes being approved by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CFO is ultimately accountable\nfor compliance with our tax strategy.\n111 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\ncompany. Risk Management evaluates, consolidates, and aggregates the identified risks and\nopportunities (\u2018bottom-up assessment\u2019).\n(6827) Risk Management discusses the assessment of substantial risks and opportunities with the members\nof the Executive Board and leaders directly reporting to them. The Executive Board members and their\ndirect reports validate the assessment of risks and opportunities in their respective area of\nresponsibility (\u2018top-down assessment\u2019).\n(6827) Risk Management provides a consolidated report to the Executive Board summarizing the results of\nboth bottom-up and top-down assessment as well as the risk and opportunity profile to highlight a\npotential threat to the company\u2019s rating and going concern. The Executive Board reviews the report,\njointly agrees on a company assessment of risks and opportunities and decides if Risk Owners are\nrequired to take further action.\n(6827) Based on the Executive Board\u2019s decision, Risk Management creates the final risk and opportunity\nreport that is also shared with the \u2018CLG.\u2019\n(6827) The Executive Board presents in collaboration with Risk Management the final risk and opportunity\nassessment results to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\nMaterial changes in previously reported risks and opportunities or newly identified material risks and\nopportunities as well as any issues identified that, due to their material nature, require immediate\nreporting are also reported outside the regular half-yearly reporting stream on an ad hoc basis to the\nExecutive Board. To further improve the risk culture at adidas, we are also offering a risk management\ntraining to all our employees through our company intranet.\nCOMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ADIDAS FAIR PLAY)\n\u2310\nWe consider compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations to be imperative.\nThe Executive Board sets the tone from the top, and every employee is required to act ethically and in\ncompliance with the law as well as with internal and other external regulations while executing the\ncompany\u2019s business. We believe adidas Fair Play will prevent a majority of potential compliance issues.\nFor that reason, we have specific measures to detect and respond to any concerns. We realize, however,\nthat no compliance system can eliminate all violations.\nThe adidas Chief Compliance Officer oversees the company\u2019s Compliance Management System (CMS). We\nsee compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain.\nOur central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance\nOfficers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis. In addition, the\ncentral Compliance team regularly conducts compliance reviews within selected entities.\nThe company\u2019s CMS is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. It refers to the OECD\nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises and is designed to:\n(6827) support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable growth through good corporate governance,\n(6827) reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage caused by non-compliant conduct,\n(6827) protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the company and its brand through compliant\nconduct, and\n(6827) support \u2018Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u2019 (\u2018DEI\u2019) initiatives by fighting harassment and discrimination.\n163 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nThe adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct is accessible on our website, includes guidelines for employee\nbehavior in everyday work, and is applicable globally for all business areas. In 2020, we revised the Code of\n\u00ac\nConduct to ensure it remains up to date and reflects our business environment.\n\u25ba ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CODE-OF-CONDUCT\n\u2310\nThe Fair Play Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect, and\nrespond.\n(6827) Prevention: The Compliance team regularly reviews and updates the CMS as necessary. In addition to\nthe revised Fair Play Code of Conduct mentioned above, we also support all initiatives to prevent and\nfight harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Management also shares compliance-related\ncommunication, and the Compliance department provides mandatory training to all employees globally\nduring onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles. The Compliance team and partners also provide\ntargeted in-person compliance training as appropriate with senior management and newly promoted\nor hired senior executives across the globe in order to further enhance the compliance \u2018tone from the\ntop,\u2019 as well as the \u2018tone from the middle.\u2019 We closely monitor the completion rates for these training\nmeasures. We also focused on further enhancing cooperation between the Compliance team and the\nInternal Audit, the Group Policies and Internal Controls, and the Risk Management department.\n(6827) Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures in place to ensure timely detection of potential\ninfringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. Employees can report compliance\nconcerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers\nor Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or, where applicable, the Works Council.\nEmployees can also report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website,\nwhich also allow for anonymous complaints. The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times\nworldwide, including the services of interpreters, if required. They are promoted digitally and with\nposters to reach all our locations around the world. The company\u2019s work to identify potential\ncompliance violations continued in 2022.\n(6827) Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. The Chief\nCompliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional\nCompliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers. We track, monitor, and\nreport potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide. In 2022, we recorded 521 potential compliance\nviolations (2021: 485). Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are\nused to continuously improve the CMS. Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance\nviolations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of\nemployment contracts. In addition, in 2022, the Compliance team strengthened its relationship with the\nEmployee Relations (ER) organization, a key partner in many compliance matters, especially those\nrelated to harassment and discrimination.\nPOTENTIAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS\n\nMalfeasance, including conflicts of interest and corruption 1cases in 2022 and 2021 9 21\n\n\nAnonymous contact to hotline 55 in 2022 and 47 in 2021\nNamed contact to hotline 26 30 in 2022 and 2021\nCompliance Officer and other 18 23 in 2022 and in 2021\nThe company\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer regularly reports to the Executive Board on the further\ndevelopment of the compliance program and on major compliance cases. In addition, the Chief\nCompliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. In 2022, the Chief Compliance\nOfficer attended four meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to report on the further\ndevelopment of the compliance program, major compliance cases, and other relevant compliance topics.\nThe Compliance department has revised its process for detecting compliance risks and included new\nrisks, as well as captured some risk areas (e.g., e-commerce) more clearly. In addition, the description of\n\u00ac\nthe CMS has been sharpened.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROCESS\nPURSUANT TO \u00a7 315 SECTION 4 GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HANDELSGESETZBUCH \u2013 HGB)\nThe accounting-related internal control and risk management system of the company represents a\nprocess embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system. It aims to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the company\u2019s external financial reporting by ensuring company-\nwide compliance with statutory accounting regulations, in particular the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance Manual). We regard the\ninternal control and risk management system as a process based on the principle of segregation of duties,\nencompassing various sub-processes in the areas of Accounting, Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Planning,\nReporting, and Legal, focusing on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of\nfinancial reporting risks. Clearly defined responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process. In a\nfirst step, the internal control and risk management system serves to identify, assess, limit, and control\nrisks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process that might result in the consolidated\nfinancial statements not being compliant with internal and external regulations.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To monitor the\neffectiveness of ICoFR, the Group Policies and Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit\ndepartment regularly review accounting-related processes. Additionally, as part of the year-end audit, the\nexternal auditor assesses the effectiveness of selected internal controls, including IT controls. The Audit\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR.\nAll adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance\nManual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the\ncompany-wide intranet. We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory\nchanges and internal developments. Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all\nadidas companies. Clear policies serve to limit employees\u2019 scope of discretion with regard to recognition\nand valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within\nthe company. We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the\nfour-eyes principle in accounting-related processes. In addition, the local manager responsible for the\naccounting-related process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director\nconfirm adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting\ndepartment semi-annually.\n165 \n1 2 3 4 5\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nThe accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services.\nVirtually all the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide\nstandardized SAP system. Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company,\nthe local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS.\nAt the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by adidas\ncompanies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments. These reviews include automated\nvalidations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and\nadherence to the reporting logic. In addition, differences between current-year and prior-year financial\ndata as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level. If necessary, adidas seeks the opinion of\nindependent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a non-routine basis.\nAfter ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation process begins,\nrunning automatically on SAP SEM-BCS. Controls within the individual consolidation steps, such as those\nrelating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are conducted both manually and system-\nbased, using automatically created consolidation logs. Any inadequacies are remedied manually by\nsystematically processing the individual errors as well as differences and are reported back to the adidas\ncompanies. After finalization of all consolidation steps, all items in the consolidated income statement and\nin the consolidated statement of financial position are analyzed with respect to trends and variances.\nUnless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies are asked to explain any identified material\ndeviations.\nAll financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization\nconcepts, approval concepts, and access restrictions. Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular\nbasis and updated if required. The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is\nminimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of\nchange processes, and regular data backups.\nFurthermore, the adidas internal control and risk management system includes non-accounting-related\ncontrols which serve to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of\noperations, reliability of non-financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The\ninternal control and risk management system regarding the non-accounting-related activities focuses also\non the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of relevant risks. It is as well\nembedded within the company-wide corporate governance system and encompasses various sub-\nprocesses in the areas of Brands, Operations (including Procurement and IT), Sales, or Human Resources.\nAll adidas companies are also required to comply with the non-accounting-related policies (\u2018Policy\nManual\u2019), which are available to all employees involved in the various processes through the company-\nwide intranet and are updated and communicated on a regular basis.\nThe effectiveness of the non-accounting-related controls is also regularly monitored by the Group Policies\nand Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit department. The reporting of internal control\nresults to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board includes the effectiveness of non-accounting-\nrelated controls as well.\nNothing came to our attention that would cause us to doubt the appropriateness and effectiveness of the\nentire internal control and risk management system. However, due to the limitations of any internal\ncontrol and risk management system, absolute certainty about the appropriateness and effectiveness of\nthese systems cannot be guaranteed.31\n31 The statement in relation to German Corporate Governance Code A5 was not audited in terms of content as part of the audit of this Group Management\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nperformance. In addition, global competition for highly qualified personnel remains fierce. As a result, the\nloss of key personnel in strategic positions and the inability to identify, recruit, and retain highly qualified\nand skilled talent who best meet the specific needs of our company pose risks to our business\nperformance.\nWe are taking various measures to ensure that we maintain a culture that fosters \u2018DEI.\u2019 Through several\nspecialized programs, \u2018DEI\u2019 is embedded into our recruitment processes. Our \u2018Global DEI Council\u2019 drives\nthe increase of representation, retention, and advancement of diverse talents within our global workforce.\nFurthermore, our workforce takes part in \u2018DEI\u2019 learning programs. To ensure effective leadership across\nthe company we offer a portfolio of leadership development experiences designed for every level of\nmanagement across all markets and functions. To optimize staffing levels and resource allocation (i.e.,\nhaving the right people with the right skillsets in the right roles at the right time), we adjust resource\nallocation where required to reflect developments in business performance, the economic environment\nand our company\u2019s strategic priorities. Organizational transformations and reorganizations are supported\nby change activations with our leadership teams and organizational design consultancy. We continuously\ninvest in improving employer branding activities, and our global recruiting organization constantly\nenhances our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities. Our global succession\nmanagement helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and therefore reduces\nsuccession risk.\nRISKS RELATED TO MEDIA AND STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES\nAdverse or inaccurate media coverage on our products or business practices as well as negative social\nmedia discussion may significantly harm adidas\u2019 reputation and brand image, lead to public misperception\nof the company\u2019s business performance and eventually result in a sales slowdown. Similarly, certain\nactivities on the part of key stakeholders (e.g., non-governmental organizations, governmental institutions)\ncould cause reputational damage, distract top management, and disrupt business activities. Despite the\ntermination of the adidas Yeezy partnership in 2022, due to its former size and relevance, related\nstakeholder reactions and negative media coverage could still be possible.\nTo mitigate these risks, we pursue proactive, open communication and engagement with key stakeholders\n(e.g., consumers, media, the financial community, non-governmental organizations, governmental\ninstitutions) on a continuous basis. In addition, we have established clear crisis communication processes\nto ensure a quick and effective response to adverse developments. We have also strengthened social\nmedia capabilities and created various digital newsrooms around the globe that enable continuous\nmonitoring of social media content related to the company\u2019s products and activities and allow early\nmanagement of potentially damaging social media discussion. On a case-by-case basis, we seek external\nadvice from experts in communication and stakeholder management.\nIT AND CYBER SECURITY RISKS\nTheft, leakage, corruption, or unavailability of critical information (e.g., consumer data, employee data,\nproduct data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, or the inability to\nperform key business processes. Key business processes, including product marketing, order\nmanagement, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support, and financial reporting, are\nall dependent on IT systems. Significant outages, application failures, or cyber security threats to our\ninfrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in reputational damage, regulatory\npenalties, or cause considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data.\nTo mitigate these risks, our IT organization proactively engages in system preventive maintenance, service\ncontinuity planning, adherence to IT policies and maintenance of a comprehensive information security\nprogram. Information security governance, data security, security architecture design, continuity\n\n\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT \u2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nOUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS\nmanagement, and employee awareness programs help us to protect the company adequately. We have\nalso secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cyber security incidents.\nBUSINESS PARTNER RISKS\nadidas interacts and enters into partnerships with various third parties, such as athletes, creative\npartners, innovation partners, retail partners, or suppliers of goods or services. As a result, the company\nis exposed to a multitude of business partner risks.\nWe work with strategic partners in various areas of our business (e.g., product creation, manufacturing,\nresearch, and development) or distributors in a few selected markets whose approach might differ from\nour own business practices and standards, which could also negatively impact the company\u2019s business\nperformance and reputation. Similarly, failure to maintain strong relationships with our partners could\nnegatively impact the company\u2019s sales and profitability. Risks may also arise from a dependency on\nparticular partners. For example, the overdependency on a supplier or customer increases the company\u2019s\nvulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls, respectively, and could lead to significant margin pressure.\nBusiness partner default (including insolvency) or other disruptive events such as strikes may negatively\naffect the company\u2019s business activities and result in additional costs and liabilities as well as lower sales\nfor the company. Unethical business practices or improper behavior on the part of business partners could\nhave a negative spillover effect on the company\u2019s reputation, lead to higher costs or liabilities or even\ndisrupt business activities.\nTo mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally\ninclude clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our\npartnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of\npromotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners.\nWe utilize a broad distribution strategy, which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer\nbusiness to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted\nfor more than 5% of the company\u2019s sales in 2022. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with\nsuppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality, and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any\npotential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we\nenforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and\nenvironmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance\ncoverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers\u2019 premises. To\nreduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas\nworks with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products,\ndoes not have a single-sourcing model.\nCOMPLIANCE RISKS\nAs a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations. Non-compliance with\nsuch laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause reputational damage. For example,\nnon-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, such as the EU General\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR), may result in substantial fines. In addition, publication of failure to\ncomply with data protection and privacy regulations could cause reputational damage and result in a loss\nof consumer trust in our brands. We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our\nemployees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior. This\nincludes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices,\nbribery, corruption, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace.\nOur Compliance Management System (CMS) helps us to prevent, detect, and adequately respond to these\nrisks. Our Global Policy Manual provides a framework for basic work procedures and processes, and our\nFair Play Code of Conduct stipulates that every employee and our business partners shall act ethically in\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

The disclosure required under paragraph 16 shall include the following information:\n(a) a description of the procedures in place to prevent, detect, and address allegations or incidents of corruption and\nbribery;\n(b) whether the investigators or investigating committee are separate from the chain of management involved in the\nmatter; and\n(c) the process, if any, to report outcomes to the administrative, management and supervisory bodies.\n\nDisclosure Requirement G1-3 \u2013 Prevention and detection of corruption and bribery\nAR 4. \u2018Functions-at-risk\u2019 means those functions deemed to be at risk of corruption and bribery as a result of its tasks and\nresponsibilities.\nAR 5. Disclosures may include details about the risk assessments and/or mapping, as well as monitoring\nprogrammes and/or internal control procedures performed by the undertaking to detect corruption and bribery.\n252/284 \nAR 6. The undertaking\u2019s policies on corruption and bribery may be relevant to specific groups of people, either because\nthey are expected to implement them (for example, the undertaking\u2019s employees, contractors and suppliers), or\nbecause they have a direct interest in their implementation (for example, value chain workers, investors). The\nundertaking may disclose the communication tools and channels (e.g., flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites,\nsocial media, face to face interactions, unions and/or workers representatives) to communicate policies to such\ngroups. This may also include the identification and/or removal of potential barriers to dissemination, such as\nthrough translation into relevant languages or the use of graphic depictions.\nAR 7. The undertaking may disclose an analysis of its training activities by, for example, region of training or category of\nown workforce where its programmes differ significantly based on such factors and such information would be\nuseful to users.\nAR 8. The undertaking may present the required information about training using the following table:\nAnti-corruption and bribery training illustrative example\nDuring the 20XY financial year ABC provided training to its at-risk own workers in terms of its policy (see note x). For those at-risk\nfunctions the training is mandatory, but ABC also made available voluntary training for other own workers.\n \n\n-----------------\n\n # ESG-REPORTING:\nOverview / Airbus SE \n Total employee training 2022 1.78 (millions of hours) security and its strategic autonomy.\nEthics & Compliance e-learning sessions 290,178\nAirbus Defence and Space holds a 37.5% stake in MBDA (a joint venture with BAE Systems and Leonardo). MBDA offers missile systems capabilities that cover the whole range of solutions for air dominance, ground-based air defence, maritime superiority and battlefield engagement. Beyond its role in European markets, MBDA has an established presence in export markets like Asia,\nThe broad product portfolio covers all five principal missile system categories: air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, anti-ship and surface-to-surface. MBDA\u2019s product range also includes a portfolio of airborne countermeasures such as missile warning and decoy systems and other customer support activities.\nThe most significant programmes currently under development are the next generation of the successful MICA air-to-air missile (Missile d'interception, de combat et d'autod\u00e9fense), the SPEAR 3 missile (Selected Precision Effects at Range Capability 3), the precision attack Brimstone 3 missile, the CAMM-ER missile (Common Anti-Air Modular Missile Extended Range), the Anglo-French joint initiative for a FC/ASW (Future Cruise / Anti- Ship Weapon), the development of Anti-ship weapons for the two nations, as well as the battlefield engagement MHT missile (Missile Haute Trame).\nRecent product upgrades also include the Aster Block 1 NT (New Technology), the air and missile defence systems for France and Italy, the Sea Venom / ANL (Anti-Navire L\u00e9ger) missile for the helicopters of the UK and French navies, as well as the Enforcer/ MMP (Missile Moyenne Port\u00e9e) missile for the battlefield.\nFurther activities include the preparation of hypersonic and direct energy applications/systems for future programmes such as FCAS and Tempest, the production of various aircraft packages for the Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale existing programmes (including ASRAAM, MICA NT, and Meteor BVRAAM), as well as the production of various packages for frigates and corvettes systems/missiles (including Aster B1, CAMM, VL MICA, Marte ER and Otomat).\nArianeGroup\nAirbus Defence and Space is active in the field of launchers and launch services through its ArianeGroup joint venture, which prior to July 2017 was named Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL).\nArianeGroup is responsible for the coordination and programme management of civil activities of the launcher business and relevant participations that have been transferred. ArianeGroup owns a total 74% stake in Arianespace, 46% of Starsem and 51% of Eurockot, providing a complete range of launch services with the Ariane, Vega and Rockot launchers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Insurance Risk Management function (\u201cIRM\u201d) is established to proactively and efficiently respond to risks that can be treated by insurance techniques. IRM is responsible for all corporate insurance activities and related protection for the Company and is empowered to deal directly with the insurance and re-insurance markets via the Company\u2019s inhouse broker entity. IRM\u2019s continuous objective in 2022 was to further implement and improve efficient and appropriate corporate and project-related insurance solutions.\nIRM\u2019s mission includes the definition and implementation of the Company\u2019s strategy for insurance risk management to help ensure that harmonised insurance policies and standards are in place for all insurable risks worldwide for the Company. A systematic review, monitoring and reporting procedure applicable to all Divisions is in place to assess the exposure and protection systems applicable to all the Company\u2019s sites. The Company\u2019s insurance programmes cover high risk exposures related to its assets and liabilities.\nAsset and liability insurance policies underwritten by IRM for the Company cover risks such as property damage, business interruption, cyber, aviation and non-aviation general and product liability. IRM also provides a Group insurance policy for Supervisory and Managing Board Members and certain\nother employees of the Company. The Company follows a policy of seeking to transfer the insurable risk of the Company to external insurance markets at reasonable conditions, on customised and sufficient terms and limits as provided by the international insurance markets. A difficult global corporate insurance environment remained in 2022 due to economical and geopolitical situations and the corporate insurers have maintained their underwriting strategy for large corporations, however, Airbus\u2019 positive outlook and insurance strategy allowed to differentiate the impact on insurance policies.\nAirbus is, with other European companies, one of the founding members of the cyber insurance mutual Miris dedicated to cyber risks. Miris will participate in the cyber group insurance policy in 2023.\nThe insurance industry and some risk factors impact on the Company\u2019s risk remain unpredictable and most Group insurance policies are renewed on an annual basis. There may be further demands to change scope of coverage, premiums and deductible amounts. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its current levels of coverage nor that the insurance policies in place are adequate to cover all significant risk exposure of the Company.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in various governmental, legal and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, the most significant of which are described below. Other than as described below, there are no material governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened) which may have or have had in the recent past significant effects on Airbus SE\u2019s or the Company\u2019s Financial Position or profitability.\nRegarding the Company\u2019s provisions policy, the Company recognises provisions for litigation and claims when (i) it has a present obligation from legal actions, governmental investigations, proceedings and other claims resulting from past events that are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against the Company, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle such obligation and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of such obligation can be made. Although the Company believes that adequate provisions have been made to cover current or contemplated general and specific litigation and regulatory risks, no assurance can be provided that such provisions will be sufficient. For the amount of provisions for litigation and claims, please refer to the \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 25: Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities\u201d.\nIf the Company concludes that the disclosures relative to contingent liabilities can be expected to prejudice seriously its position in a dispute with other parties, the Company limits its disclosures to the nature of the dispute.\nInvestigation by the UK SFO,\nFrance\u2019s PNF, US Departments of State and Justice and Related Commercial Litigation\nThe Company reached final agreements (\u201cthe agreements\u201d) with the French Parquet National Financier (\u201cPNF\u201d), the UK Serious Fraud Office (\u201cSFO\u201d), and the US Department of Justice (\u201cDoJ\u201d) resolving the authorities\u2019 investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption, as well as with the US Department of State (\u201cDoS\u201d) and the DoJ to resolve their investigations into inaccurate and misleading filings made with the DoS pursuant to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d). The agreements were approved and made public on 31 January 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company agreed to pay penalties of \u20ac3,597,766,766 plus interest and costs to the French, UK and US authorities. This was recognised in the Company\u2019s 2019 accounts. The settlements with each authority were as follows: PNF \u20ac2,083,137,455, the SFO \u20ac983,974,311, the DoJ \u20ac526,150,496 and the DoS \u20ac9,009,008 of which \u20ac4,504,504 May be used for approved remedial compliance measures. All penalties have been paid.\nUnder the terms of the Convention judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public (\u201cCJIP\u201d) with the PNF, the Company has an obligation to submit its compliance programme to targeted audits carried out by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise Anticorruption (\u201cAFA\u201d) over a period of three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the SFO, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on the Company in light of the continuing monitorship to be conducted by the AFA.\nUnder the terms of the DPA with the DoJ, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on Airbus under the agreement with the DoJ, but the Company will periodically report on its continuing compliance enhancement progress during the three year term of the DPA and carry out further reviews as required by the DoJ.\nThe agreements resulted in the suspension of prosecution for a duration of three years. This deferral period ended on 31 January 2023. The Company awaits the formal determination by the authorities that it has complied with the agreements\u2019 terms throughout the period whereupon it expects the closure of the prosecutions in line with the procedural requirements of each country. On 13 February 2023, the SFO gave notice to the Company discontinuing the prosecution. On 17 March 2023, the PNF gave notice of the same with receipt of the Constat de l'extinction de l'action publique.\nUnder the terms of the Consent Agreement with the DoS, the DoS has agreed to settle all civil violations of the ITAR outlined in the Company\u2019s voluntary disclosures identified in the Consent Agreement, and the Company has agreed to retain an independent export control compliance officer, who will monitor the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s export control systems and its compliance with the ITAR for a duration of three years.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s decision to redirect export control compliance resources to ensure compliance with export control restrictions and international sanctions announced against Russia, Belarus and certain Russian entities and individuals following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Company asked the DoS to extend the Consent Agreement by nine months. The DoS has granted the extension. The Company does not expect the Consent Agreement extension to have an impact on the DPAs with the SFO and DoJ, nor on the CJIP with the PNF, nor on the AFA\u2019s monitorship, as those are independent of the DoS\u2019s civil compliance programme review.\nAny breach of the terms of the agreements by the Company could lead to rescission by the authorities of the terms of the agreements and reopening of the prosecutions. Prosecution could result in the imposition of further monetary penalties or other sanctions including additional tax liability and could have a material impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nIn addition to any pending investigation in other jurisdictions, the factual disclosures made in the course of reaching the agreements may result in the commencement of additional investigations in other jurisdictions. Such investigations could also result in (i) civil claims or claims by shareholders against the Company, (ii) adverse consequences on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain or continue financing for current or future projects, (iii) limitations on the eligibility of group companies for certain public sector contracts, and/or (iv) damage to the Company\u2019s business or reputation via negative publicity adversely affecting the Company\u2019s prospects in the commercial market place.\nAirbus will continue to cooperate with the authorities in the future, pursuant to the agreements and to enhance its strong Ethics & Compliance culture within the Company.\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.1 Presentation of the Company\nSeveral consultants and other third parties have initiated commercial litigation and arbitration against the Company seeking relief. The agreements reached with authorities may lead to additional commercial litigation and arbitration against the Company and tax liability in the future, which could have a material impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn August 2020, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in US federal court in the state of New Jersey against Airbus SE and members of its current and former management. The Company was served with the complaint in the fourth quarter of 2021. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of alleged shareholders that purchased or otherwise acquired Airbus SE securities in the US between 24 February 2016 and 30 July 2020, and asserted violations of US securities laws. The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements or omissions concerning, among other things, the Company\u2019s agreements approved on 31 January 2020 with the French PNF, the UK SFO, the US DoJ and the US DoS as well as the Company\u2019s historic practices regarding the use of third party business partners and anti-corruption compliance. The matter was fully and finally settled on 30 September 2022 in exchange for a payment in the amount of $5,000,000 USD without any acknowledgement of liability.\nIn addition, the Company received notification in August 2021 of two separate claims and in March 2022 a third claim, all alleging similar facts as the US class action. Three claims have been filed in the Netherlands purportedly on behalf of Airbus investors.\nThe first Dutch claim was filed in August 2021 by a special purpose vehicle incorporated under the laws of Guernsey, an assignee purportedly representing numerous private shareholders and institutional investors, seeking a declaratory judgment with damages to be assessed in follow on proceedings. This claim is now pending before the Amsterdam District Court.\nThe second Dutch claim was filed in December 2021 following a demand letter sent by a foundation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, a purported representative of unnamed institutional and retail investors worldwide, starting a class action against the Company before the Dutch courts. This second Dutch claim targets the Company, certain of the Company\u2019s current and former directors and officers, and the Company\u2019s current and former auditors.\nThe third Dutch claim was a class action filed in April 2022 against the Company by a foundation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. In accordance with Dutch procedural law, the two Dutch class action claims are treated jointly as one case.\nThe Dutch claims allege that the Company violated its reporting obligations by failing to adequately inform investors and providing false or misleading information about its use of intermediaries and alleged corrupt practices, its related financial exposure, internal investigations and subsequent measures taken by the Company, and related criminal investigations, which allegedly impacted the Company\u2019s share price.\nThe Company cannot exclude the possibility that additional claims are filed related to this subject matter attempting different theories of recovery in the same or different jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company believes it has solid grounds to defend itself against the allegations. The consequences of such litigation and the outcome of the proceedings cannot be fully assessed at this stage, but any judgment or decision unfavourable to the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nAir France Flight 447 Trial\nOn 1 June 2009, an A330 operated by Air France flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean with 228 persons onboard. The wreckage was located in April 2011 after several search campaigns organised by the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses (\u201cBEA\u201d), which published its final investigation report in July 2012. In the wake of the accident, the prosecutor in Paris opened an investigation for involuntary manslaughter and Airbus SAS was charged in March 2011. In September 2019, the investigating magistrates closed the investigation and dismissed all criminal charges after a thorough analysis of the technical and legal elements of the case. However, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned the magistrates\u2019 decision and ordered trial for involuntary manslaughter. The Company\u2019s appeal to the French Supreme Court has been dismissed. The trial took place in the fourth quarter of 2022. The prosecutor recommended a dismissal of all criminal charges against Air France and Airbus. The judgment of the Paris Criminal Court expected on 17 April 2023, if unfavourable to the Company, could result in damage to its business or reputation.\nQatar Airways Commercial Litigation\nCiting surface degradation on some of its A350 fleet and alleging an underlying \u201cdesign defect\u201d, Qatar Airways filed a legal claim against the Company in the London Commercial Court on 17 December 2021. On 1 February 2023, the parties announced they had reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal dispute over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. The parties have proceeded to discontinue their legal claims. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability for either party. The parties have also agreed terms for the delivery of 50 A321 and 23 A350 aircraft.\nGrand Canyon Helicopter Accident\nOn 10 February 2018, a fatal accident occurred in the Grand Canyon at a site called Quartermaster in Arizona involving an EC130 B4 helicopter operated by Papillon Helicopters impacting the canyon floor and catching fire, leading to five fatalities and two severely injured persons. Following the accident, product liability claims were filed in Nevada state court in the US, including claims by the estate and parents of a deceased passenger and by the injured pilot of the helicopter. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims, but such claims may generate negative publicity and reputational harm. The trial is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2024. Any judgment or decision unfavourable to the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company as well as on its reputation.\nOther Investigations\nThe Company cooperated fully with the authorities in relation to three investigations initiated by independent magistrates in France concerning the activities of commercial intermediaries in Libya, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and several Eastern European countries. In recognition of the fulsome nature of the cooperation and upon payment of a penalty of \u20ac15.8 million, all three investigations were closed by means of a Convention judiciaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (\u201cCJIP\u201d) with the PNF on 30 November 2022. This ends all remaining prosecutions in France for similar historical activities.\nIn 2019, the Company self-reported to German authorities potentially improper advance receipt and communication of confidential customer information by employees of Airbus Defence and Space GmbH. The information concerned relates to future German government procurement projects. The self- disclosure by the Company followed an internal review with the support of an external law firm. Both the German Ministry of Defence and the Munich public prosecutor opened an investigation into the matter. The investigation could have an impact on Airbus Defence and Space GmbH\u2019s and Airbus Secure Land Communications GmbH\u2019s ability to participate in future public procurement projects in Germany. In 2021 the Munich prosecution issued a penalty notice against Airbus Defence and Space GmbH for \u20ac 10 million for negligent violation of supervisory duties in connection with this matter. The Company continues to fully cooperate with relevant authorities.\nConscious of the strategic importance of sustainability, the Company has defined governance at the highest level. Oversight has been established at the Board of Directors level with the Ethics, Compliance and Sustainability Committee (\u201cECSC\u201d). For further information about the ECSC, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.1 Management and Control\u201d. The ECSC is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors to oversee the Company\u2019s:\n\u2013 Culture and commitment to ethical business, integrity and sustainability;\n\u2013 Ethics and Compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of ethics and compliance, including all associated internal policies, procedures and controls; and\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n\u2013 Sustainability strategy and effective governance to ensure that sustainability-related topics are taken into account in the Company\u2019s strategy and objectives.\nUnder the Board Rules, the Board of Directors delegates the day-to-day management of the Company to the CEO, who, supported by the Executive Committee, makes decisions with respect to the management of the Company, including sustainability. The Executive Committee has the responsibility to provide top level expectations and direction, while overseeing and validating the sustainability strategy. This entails validating sustainability targets, including those integrated into the Top Company Objectives.\nThis graphic represents the organizational structure for governance related to ethics, compliance, and sustainability within a company. At the top, there is the \"Board of Directors\" which oversees the \"Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee.\" Directly below the Board of Directors, there is an \"Executive Committee\" which is connected to several specialized boards. These boards are the \"Environment Executive Steering Committee,\" \"Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Board,\" \"Product Safety Board,\" \"Occupational Health and Safety Governance Board,\" and \"Human Rights, Business Integrity, Sustainable Supply Chain\" board. The last board listed has a direct line indicating that topics are cascaded directly to the Executive Committee. This structure is designed to ensure oversight and accountability in various key areas of corporate governance.\nThis graphic represents the organizational structure for governance related to ethics, compliance, and sustainability within a company. At the top, there is the \"Board of Directors\" which oversees the \"Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee.\" Directly below the Board of Directors, there is an \"Executive Committee\" which is connected to several specialized boards. These boards are the \"Environment Executive Steering Committee,\" \"Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Board,\" \"Product Safety Board,\" \"Occupational Health and Safety Governance Board,\" and \"Human Rights, Business Integrity, Sustainable Supply Chain\" board. The last board listed has a direct line indicating that topics are cascaded directly to the Executive Committee. This structure is designed to ensure oversight and accountability in various key areas of corporate governance.\nThe Executive Committee is supported by several committees or boards linked to the Company\u2019s four sustainability commitments:\n\u2013 the Environment Executive Steering Committee, the Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Board, the Product Safety Board as well as the Occupational Health and Safety Governance Board (created in 2022; see \u201c\u2013 1.2.9 Health and Safety\u201d), all chaired\nby Executive Committee members;\n\u2013 the Steering Committees of the Human Rights and Sustainable\nSupply Chain Roadmaps, both sponsored by Executive Committee members.\nOther sustainability topics such as business integrity are brought directly to the attention of the Executive Committee. Where relevant, additional elements of governance linked to specific topics are explained in the governance sections of this report.\nOrganisation and policy framework: The sustainability & environment team put in place in January 2020 at corporate level has continued to develop and expand. Its mission continues to focus on:\n- Setting the ambition level regarding the Company\u2019s environmental and social commitments;\n- Identifying the levers to achieve this ambition;\n- Enabling the business to deliver this ambition across the\nfull value chain;\n- Engaging employees on sustainability;\n- Providing clarity on ambition and progress to internal and external stakeholders;\n- Coordinating with relevant functions the performance and reporting on progress with regards to the four commitments.\nWhile the sustainability & environment team has a Company-wide role to provide direction and check regularly on advancements across all sustainability topics, there are for each of those topics (e.g. health and safety, inclusion and diversity, human rights, etc.), related functions, departments or \u201croadmaps\u201d (multi-functional teams addressing cross-functional sustainability topics) driving\ntheir continuous improvement. These teams are for the most part supported by dedicated policies which are referred to in the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct \u2013 a single reference intended to guide daily behaviour and help employees resolve the most common ethical and compliance issues that they may encounter. The Code of Conduct applies to all of the Company\u2019s employees and directors, regardless of their job title, responsibilities, seniority, or location, within every subsidiary or joint venture where the Company has control.\nIncentivisation and remuneration: The Company also believes the integration of sustainability criteria into its reward mechanisms is an important enabler for accelerating its sustainability ambition. A sustainability criterion is integrated into the common collective component of the CEO\u2019s variable remuneration, accounting for 20%, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.2.1 Remuneration Policy\u201d. This principle also applies to the other members of the Executive Committee who do not serve on the Board of Directors, and to a large extent to executives and \u201cLevel IV\u201d managers employed at the Company. Other criteria also apply to all employees as summarised below:\nVII. Airbus\u2019 Way Forward: Vigilance Plan\nThe Company is determined to conduct its business responsibly and with integrity. It is convinced that promoting responsible business conduct within its value chain is key to sustainable growth. The Company\u2019s vigilance plan includes measures to identify risks and prevent serious impacts related to sustainability resulting from the Company\u2019s own operations and from its suppliers and other contractors (including subcontractors). As far as its own operations are concerned, the Company has adopted internal policies and management tools to perform the monitoring, assessment, mitigation and reporting of risk and compliance allegations, which are embedded into the Company\u2019s culture and processes. For the Company\u2019s vigilance plan for its supply chain, see \u201c\u2013 1.2.15 Responsible Supply Chain\u201d, which shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference and form part of this plan.\nEnterprise risk management and internal audit:With regards to risk management, sustainability risks and opportunities are fully embedded in the Company\u2019s ERM system. For further information on ERM, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.1.3 Enterprise Risk Management System\u201d. For further information on the Company\u2019s risks, see \u201c\u2013 Risk Factors\u201d. Internal audits are also performed regularly across the Company, including on sustainability topics. External audits are performed in line with certification requirements, as detailed in the related material topic sections.\nSustainability competencies and employee engagement:\nRaising awareness, developing competencies and engaging employees are essential to preventing and mitigating sustainability risks and maximising opportunities. On this matter, the Company offered employees more than 900 online and in- person training opportunities in 2022, ranging from ethics and compliance to export control, health and safety, product safety, cyber security, internal controls, inclusion and diversity, quality and customer centricity, sustainability awareness and more. Training courses linked to sustainability topics were integrated into the 2022 mandatory training list for Company employees. Specific information on training is covered in the related material topic sections.\nAffiliates: All Company controlled affiliates are expected to deploy similar internal policies by applying the Company\u2019s directives. A company-wide single directive defines rules, processes and procedures applicable to the Company\u2019s affiliates and their respective boards, directors and officers. Its enforcement is supported by the Directors\u2019 training programme which was delivered to 117 people in 2022 over eight full-day digital sessions, as well as on-boarding sessions performed for newly appointed managing directors of controlled affiliates. The single directive assists the Company\u2019s affiliates in effectively fulfilling their responsibilities, while assuring the Company\u2019s ongoing commitment to high standards of corporate governance. It was built on the basis of Company related internal policies including, but not limited to: the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, International Framework Agreement, Agreement on the European Works Council, Supplier Code of Conduct, Health & Safety Policy, Environmental Policy, the Company\u2019s Anti-Corruption Policy and related directives. An online Internal Controls Self Assessment (\u201cICSA\u201d) is completed on an annual basis by the controlled affiliates to self-assess their internal controls, including how they relate to the environment, health and safety, human resources, governance, finance, procurement and compliance requirements in order to identify any gaps and define remedial action plans as required. Controlled affiliates can update the self-assessment on a quarterly basis based on their progression. Following ICSA, internal verifications are carried out by the respective corporate functions to validate answers and, when gaps are identified, develop improvement measures jointly with controlled affiliates to enhance their conformity level. In 2022, 81 controlled affiliates were selected to perform such verifications. Verifications are run every three years at least, and more frequently when ICSAs evidence material gaps. The Company\u2019s controlled affiliates are also asked to regularly evaluate risks via the Company\u2019s ERM system, and to regularly monitor them as part of their risk assessment process.\nThe Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance programme seeks to ensure that the Company\u2019s business practices conform to applicable laws, regulations and ethical business principles, as well as reinforcing a culture of integrity and speak-up. In 2022, Ethics & Compliance continued to be a top priority for the Company. In its list of priorities for the year, the Company set the objective to Speak Up, Listen Up and act with integrity and respect.\nThe Company has worked over the past several years to develop an Ethics & Compliance programme that is structured around the following key risk areas: Business Ethics / Anti-Corruption\nCompliance, Export Compliance and Privacy. Each of these areas is, in turn, supported by dedicated compliance policies and a team responsible for their implementation, together with the identification and proposal of new measures to adapt to a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.\nImproving the Ethics & Compliance programme remains a constant and ongoing process, in cooperation with other functions within the Company, in order to sustain and capitalise on its values.\nSDGs Others\n\nII. Governance\nThe Ethics & Compliance organisation is part of the Legal Department under the ultimate responsibility of the Company\u2019s General Counsel. The aim is to provide strong governance throughout the Company with the global presence of qualified Compliance officers who ensure the Ethics & Compliance programme is implemented consistently in the different functional and operational areas.\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, who reports to both the General Counsel and the ECSC of the Board of Directors, leads a dedicated team of Compliance professionals who are responsible for supporting and advising across the Company on compliance related topics, supporting the day-to- day business, performing risk assessments, drafting policies, conducting third party due diligence, investigating compliance\nallegations, implementing tools and controls and delivering compliance training.\nThe ECSC also plays a key role in the oversight and continued development of the Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of Ethics & Compliance.\nIn addition to the dedicated Compliance professionals, the Company is coordinating a network of part-time Ethics & Compliance Representatives (\u201cECRs\u201d), spanning all Divisions, functions, and regions. The number of ECRs slightly increased in 2022, with a total of 373 ECRs at the end of 2022 (compared to 340 at the end of 2021). Although the ECR network members are not compliance experts, they play an important role in promoting\nhe Ethics & Compliance programme and culture and serve as points of contact for any employee who has questions about the Ethics & Compliance programme or wishes to raise an Ethics & Compliance concern, including but not limited to bribery or corruption. The Ethics & Compliance team animates the ECR network, providing continuous training and information to the ECRs.\nIn February 2022, the Company launched the Export Control Points of Contact (\u201cEPoCs\u201d) network, spanning all Divisions, functions, and regions. Similar to ECRs, EPoCs are not export control experts but serve as \u201cfirst line of defence\u201d and the \u201cgo-to\u201d individuals for export control matters. On the occasion of the launch, the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer stated that \u201cby raising awareness among employees and acting as local focal points for queries on Export Control- related topics in their respective functions, EPoCs will be key contributors to the Company\u2019s common objective: embed an export control compliance system and culture throughout Company\u2019s businesses.\u201d By the end of 2022, the network was established and active within the business, with a total of 570 EPOCs.\nLikewise, the Personal Data Protection Officer (\u201cDPO\u201d) relies on a team of privacy experts to guide, train and advise the business with respect to privacy requirements, and a network of Privacy Focal Points in the business functions and affiliates, to support the Airbus privacy programme.\nIII. RiskManagement\nThe Company is required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world where it conducts business. This includes countries perceived as presenting an increased risk of corruption.\nAccordingly, the Company conducts a thorough bribery and corruption risk assessment across its two Divisions and different businesses annually. The results of this risk assessment are embedded and monitored within the Company\u2019s ERM framework and highlight, among others, the risk of improper payments being made to or via third parties such as sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors, suppliers, distributors and joint venture or offset partners. Further corruption risks include the use of sponsorships, donations, or political contributions to improperly benefit decision-makers, or the provision of excessive or overly frequent gifts and hospitality by Company employees.\nIn order to ensure its compliance with Export Control regulations and laws in the European Union, US and internationally, the Company continues to strengthen its Export Control compliance programme to ensure it is fit for purpose. Where risks are identified, they are embedded and monitored in the Company\u2019s ERM. Identified risks include potential unauthorised access to export-controlled data and hardware by third parties and non-compliance with the ITAR.\nRegarding privacy, the Company undertakes privacy impact assessments depending on the nature of the personal data processed or scale of the processing. In addition, risks relating to the protection of personal data are also assessed in the context of the ERM and kept updated.\nSpecific directives have been adopted to address the Company\u2019s key compliance risk areas. These include among others:\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance organisation is charged with oversight and monitoring of these directives to ensure that they are being implemented effectively. Periodic controls on key processes are performed and reports provided to the Company\u2019s Executive Committee and the ECSC, including recommendations to strengthen the Ethics & Compliance programme where necessary.\nIn addition, the Corporate Audit & Forensic Department conducts periodic, independent audits of the Company\u2019s compliance processes to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures and allow the Company to develop action plans for strengthening such controls.\nIV. Implementation/Activities\nAwareness and Training\nAs part of their annual goals & objectives, all Company employees are required to undergo a minimum amount of compliance training via e-learning. Additionally, depending on the function, the country and the level of risk implied by their role, certain employees are selected to attend live classroom training as well, including on Anti Bribery & Corruption and Export Control. Attendance in such cases is mandatory, and managers have a responsibility to ensure that their team members do so. Exposed employees are also required to complete regular training refreshers.\nFrom 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, the Company\u2019s employees followed 290,178 Ethics & Compliance e-learning sessions, including on bribery, corruption and export control. Furthermore, 4,699 employees attended live classroom training\nn different Ethics & Compliance topics over the period, the majority of which were delivered in virtual classroom settings due to the pandemic.\nLikewise, the Company also delivered anti-bribery and corruption training towards higher risk third parties, including sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors. In 2022, 100% of higher risk third parties were trained on Ethics & Compliance requirements and expectations.\nThe Company continued the roll out of the privacy e-learning as part of the Ethics & Compliance compulsory training catalogue. 3,181 privacy training sessions were performed in 2022 (reporting period from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022).\nSpeak-Up Channel: OpenLine\nThe Company recognises that the Code of Conduct cannot address every challenging situations that may arise, and therefore encourages its employees to speak-up through various channels, including through OpenLine (available at https://www. airbusopenline.com). The OpenLine enables users to submit an alert securely and confidentially, and also to ask questions related to Ethics & Compliance.\nThe Company protects those who speak up and raise concerns appropriately and in good faith. The Company does not retaliate against anyone who raises a concern, or against those who assist in investigations of suspected violations.\n847 investigative requests received in 2022\n524\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\nIn addition, the dataprotection@airbus.com mailbox is systematically published in the Company\u2019s privacy policies and information notices specific to the various applications, to ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights and/or lodge complaints.\nTo further increase awareness about Speak-Up, in 2022, the Ethics & Compliance team conducted an analysis of the results from the Company\u2019s internal survey \u201cMy Working Environment\u201d to identify opportunities to continuously foster a Speak Up culture. This analysis led to the launch of additional initiatives throughout the Company to promote Speak-Up culture, including the development of a Speak-Up team talk in January 2022, which was shared with all managers to help them raise the importance of speaking-up with their teams. A simplified version of this \u201cteam talk\u201d was designed and deployed within the shop floor community.\nIn 2022, the Company received a total of 847 investigative requests of which 524 were HR related. Cases requiring investigation are managed by dedicated members of the Ethics & Compliance team in accordance with an internal method for the conduct of Investigations. The Ethics & Compliance team provides regular updates to the pool of internal investigators, on internal policies, recent developments in the regulatory framework, and recurring reminders on investigation best practices to ensure the consistent deployment of compliance investigations across the entire Company.\nIn some instances, the Company may engage outside counsel for support, depending on the nature of the investigation.\nThe Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee and other relevant stakeholders (including relevant authorities, if applicable, and Company\u2019s local management teams) are briefed regarding the progress and outcome of internal investigations on a regular basis.\nPolicies and Procedures\nIn 2022, the Company continued to improve its policies and procedures framework, by issuing a guidance on third parties categorisation, for example, and translating the Code of Conduct into seven additional languages to maximise the reach of this foundational document. All policies and guidelines are made available to employees on the Intranet, and classroom training\nis delivered to employees who are particularly exposed to the underlying risks as described above.\nOn the Export Control side, the Company has cascaded its Export Control requirements through nine Directives and Methods throughout the Company. The cascading triggered an update of the relevant business processes and was completed in Summer 2022.\nIn 2021 and 2022, as required under the Consent Agreement, two audits of the Company\u2019s ITAR compliance programme were undertaken by external counsels. Please refer to \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 39: Litigation and Claims\u201d (Investigation by the SFO, PNF, DoJ, DoS, Related Commercial Litigation).\nResponsible Lobbying Charter\nThe Company is committed to ensuring that any lobbying activity is undertaken in compliance with all applicable laws and its anti-corruption programme. In 2021, the Company launched a Responsible Lobbying Charter aimed at anybody who engages with public officials in any capacity, including third party representatives retained by the Company. The Charter outlines the Company\u2019s core principles for responsible lobbying and brings together the Company\u2019s key codes and directives relevant to this topic. The principles are also reinforced by a training module available to all employees.\n1.2.15 Responsible Supply Chain\nI. Introduction\nV. Outlook\nAn effective Ethics & Compliance programme is one that, by definition, continuously adapts to changes and improves over time. Going forward, the Company will continue to assess its risks and monitor and test the implementation of mitigation measures at all levels: corporate level, Divisions, regions and local entities.\nWhen misconduct reveals a gap in compliance policies, procedures or tools, the Company undertakes revisions to its Ethics & Compliance programme commensurate with the wrongdoing and in light of lessons learned. While compliance at the Company will therefore always be a work in progress, the Company is committed to this endeavour, as it aims to make its Ethics & Compliance programme sustainable over time.\nWhile the Company\u2019s products and services are sold all over the world, the majority of its supply chain is based in Europe and OECD countries. However, in the past few years, the supply chain has become concentrated and more international. In addition, and due to increasing consolidation within the aerospace and defence sector, larger work packages are being placed with a smaller number of lead suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s global sourcing footprint is represented as follows based on Tier one suppliers only.\nTo promote further globalisation of its sourcing footprint, the Company has established regional procurement offices in North America (Herndon, VA), India (Bangalore), Asia Pacific (Singapore) and China (Beijing). The regional procurement offices represent the Procurement function in the respective regions. They are responsible for strategic sourcing, general procurement and supplier development (procurement operations) while supporting the application of the Company\u2019s procurement process and policy and digital solutions. As the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business and its two Divisions are certified ISO 14001, the Procurement function acts in adherence with ISO 14001 requirements.\nII. Governance\nThe Company\u2019s sustainable supply chain ambition is built on four pillars: \u201clead the journey towards clean aerospace, respect human rights and foster inclusion, build our business on the foundation of safety and quality, exemplify business integrity\u201d.\nDerived from this ambition, the Company\u2019s Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap is based on a three-step approach; supplier\ncommitment, supplier assessment, supplier engagement & development.\nThe Company strives to make environmental and social responsibility a core element of its procurement strategy. This includes managing the relationships with suppliers throughout the sourcing strategy, supplier selection, contract management and supplier monitoring and development. The Company\u2019s suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, all business shall be conducted by suppliers in compliance with the principles of the Company\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, which is the document of reference for the Company\u2019s responsible supplier management. This Supplier Code of Conduct integrates the group-wide values and principles in line with internationally recognised standards and conventions (such as OECD and ILO).\nIn order to drive the Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap (\u201cSSCR\u201d), a monthly Steering Committee chaired by the Head of Sustainability & Environment, and the Head of Procurement Governance & Strategy and the representative of the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company is implemented. The Steering Committee includes Chief Procurement Officers of Airbus Helicopters and of Airbus Defence and Space, as well as the Head of Health & Safety, the Head of Product Safety and the Head of Ethics & Compliance, or their nominated representatives. The EVP Communication and Corporate Affairs and the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company act as sponsors of the SSCR. In addition, the Head of Procurement Governance and Strategy is part of the Procurement Leadership Team and is responsible for facilitating the communication on sustainability activities between the SSCR and the Procurement Leadership Team on a regular basis.\nIn 2022 the SSCR Steering Committee validated the annual planning and quarterly reviewed the progress of its SSCR implementation notably regarding the assessment of suppliers\u2019 sustainability practices as well as the reinforcement of the engagement with suppliers. On top of those forums, the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company also reports to the ECSC on the progress of the Company\u2019s responsible sourcing strategy implementation.\nConcrete sustainability targets have been included in the 2022 objectives of the Company\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer (\u201cCPO\u201d) and are directly linked to the CPO\u2019s variable pay and cascaded through the Company\u2019s Procurement organisations:\n\u2013 commitment by suppliers to Airbus Supplier Code of Conduct for 85% of the 2021 sourcing volume;\n\u2013 supplier sustainability assessments completed for 50% of the 2021 sourcing volume;\n\u2013 response of suppliers to CDP assessment for 75% of the 2021 sourcing volume.\nAll sustainability activities in the supply chain are based on the following key elements and principles of due diligence following the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct:\n\u2013 supply base risk mapping;\n\u2013 supplier engagement and contractual requirements; \u2013 supplier assessment/audits and development plans; \u2013 policies, tools and reporting.\nFor any anti-corruption topics in the supply chain, the Procurement function cooperates closely with the Legal & Compliance department. The Company has also engaged into a plan to further develop its due diligence mechanisms (see IV. Due Diligence in the supply chain).\nThose priorities are consistent with the most material topics identified in the Company\u2019s supply chain.\nIII. RiskManagement\nThe Company\u2019s procurement-related risks and opportunities are embedded into the Company\u2019s ERM process. Risks and opportunities related to the deployment of the sustainability roadmap in the supply chain are managed according to the Procurement ERM plan and detailed hereafter.\n1. Impact on the Company\u2019s Reputation\nAny industrial accident or other serious incident in the supply chain, or any problems of the supplier to fulfil its operational or product compliance may have a significant adverse effect on the reputation of the Company and its products and services. The Company\u2019s reputation may also be affected by the public perception of social and/or environmental impacts of its supply chain\u2019s industrial operations on local environments, communities, biodiversity and the general public\u2019s health.\n2. Impact on the Local Environment\nFrom the extraction of raw materials to the manufacturing of parts delivered to the Company, a supplier\u2019s industrial operations may have significant adverse environmental impacts on the local environment where the activity is performed, with possible impacts on air, water, soil, biodiversity, workers\u2019 occupational health and safety, on the health of the general public, on the land rights of the local or indigenous communities and on forced and child labour (see salient risks in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.10 Human Rights\u201d).\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n3. Business Disruption Risk\nIn the event of a supplier failing to comply with environmental, human/labour rights, health and safety laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the levying of civil or criminal penalties and fines against the supplier. Regulatory authorities may require them to conduct investigations and undertake remedial activities, curtail operations or close installations or facilities temporarily to prevent imminent risks.\n4. Risk of Product Non-Compliance\nThe various products manufactured and sold by suppliers must comply with applicable environmental, human/labour rights, health and safety laws and regulations, for example those covering substances and product composition. Even if a supplier seeks to ensure that its products meet the highest quality standards, increasingly stringent and complex laws and regulations, new scientific discoveries, delivery of defective products or the obligation to notify or provide regulatory authorities or others with required information (such as under the REACH regulation) may force it to adapt, redesign, redevelop, recertify and/or remove its products from the market. Seizures of defective products may be pronounced and could prevent delivery to the Company. In response, a Procurement Task Force has been established to ensure group-wide governance for supplier management and assessment of chemical regulations and obsolescence impact. This task force also coordinates communication to suppliers on substance issues and on substitution solutions qualified by the Company.\nIn this frame, the Company provided to its supply chain a dedicated Tool Kit on \u201cREACH Substances \u2013 Certain Requirements & Substitution programmes\u201d. This tool kit reminds the main principles of the REACH regulation as Authorisation, Restrictions and Substitutions programmes in order to raise the attention of the supply chain on these challenges.\nIn response to the above 1. to 4., the Company deploys responsible sourcing activities and specific supplier due diligence actions in the frame of the SSCR.\nIV. SupplyChainVigilancePlan\n1. Due Diligence in the Supply Chain\nIn 2022 the Company launched a project aimed at reinforcing due diligence in its supply chain. The outcomes of the project will be rolled out in 2023. Activities under this project cover primarily the Company\u2019s own suppliers; nonetheless, if an alert raised is linked to an upstream supplier, the Company will act on it as appropriate.\nAlert and Grievance Mechanism\nFrom 2019, the Company\u2019s OpenLine has been accessible to external stakeholders, such as suppliers and their employees. For further information on OpenLine, see \u201c\u2013 1.2.14 Business Integrity\u201d. Access to OpenLine has been reiterated in the revised Supplier Code of Conduct.\nIn addition to OpenLine, the Company\u2019s sustainable supply chain team may receive alerts from other sources including through the supplier onboarding process, media or directly from employees. During 2022, the sustainable supply chain roadmap received alerts on 44 potential allegations relating to environmental and human rights concerns in its supply chain. The number of alerts\n Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022 121\n\n\u2013 assessment of information and documentation collected\nduring the investigation, preparation of an investigation report which summarises the findings and proposes remedial actions necessary to reasonably respond to and prevent the recurrence of the conduct, if any;\n\u2013 closing the investigation and reporting;\n\u2013 monitoring of the implementation of remedial actions.\nSupplier Risk Mapping\nThe supplier risk mapping is based on the alerts and grievance mechanisms detailed above, as well as the inherent risk mapping described below. It covers primarily tier-one suppliers; nonetheless if an alert raised is linked to a sub-tier supplier, the Company will include it in its risk mapping and act on it as appropriate.\n\nEnd of 2021, the Company launched a project to digitise the way for the suppliers to provide substance in products information. The main objective is to improve traceability and transparency on substances in products from the supply chain related to regulatory requirements. It also aims at replacing the current process and allowing an automated way of sharing this information. The solution for supplier substance data collection project started in 2022, with a target for the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business of 290 suppliers\u2019 sites to be deployed in the digital solution by year-end. At the end of 2022 this target was achieved.\nResponsible Mineral Sourcing\nThe Company places great importance on the responsible sourcing of materials used in manufacturing. Some minerals including 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) are necessary for the proper functioning of components within its products. The Company largely does not directly import minerals, but these minerals are found in certain products the Company procures. In that context, the Company requires all suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations on conflict minerals, including any 3TG conflict minerals. In 2019, the Company released a Responsible Mineral Policy, which details its engagement to improve safety and human rights conditions in the mineral supply chains. As described in the section Work with External Stakeholders hereafter, the Company benefits from the Responsible Mineral Initiative (\u201cRMI\u201d) experience and available audits, tools and standardised ways of working.\nFor the small portion of direct procurement of parts containing minerals in the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division, a dedicated Conflict Mineral Management System has been established. For this small portion of direct import, the Defence and Space Division is proactively asking suppliers to disclose proof of responsible sourcing and is cross-checking this data with third parties\u2019 audits available through the RMI trade association. In 2022, the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division imported articles made of tungsten of the relevant Taric code above regulatory binding threshold; those articles are used as counterweight for aircraft. The Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division forecasted this import and performed relevant due diligence for the unique supplier supplying the material involved. The supplier was informed that the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division is expecting responsible sourcing for the tungsten purchased under this contract. The supplier demonstrated that this material was exclusively originating from responsible sources.\nThis claim of responsible sourcing is based on third party audits of the smelters involved to deliver the products. The Company reviewed this claim and recognised that the audits were part of the RMI scheme and that smelters involved in the supply chain of the tungsten concerned metals conformed to RMI standards.\nThe Company is also monitoring developments from the European Commission on critical raw materials (CRM) and is investigating the possibilities to take a deeper look at its related supply chain, through direct involvement and/or trade associations. The Supplier Code of Conduct formally requires suppliers to establish a policy and a management system to ensure that critical raw materials are sourced responsibly.\n3. Engagement and Awareness\nContractual Requirements\nThe Company\u2019s standard procurement contract templates have evolved over the last few years to reinforce clauses relating to sustainability and environment which require suppliers to:\n\u2013 comply with all applicable laws and regulations dealing with labour and employment, health and safety, environment, anti- corruption and bribery and personal data protection in relation to production, products and services;\n\u2013 provide information on substances used in manufacturing processes and contained in the product itself (covering both hazardous substances and conflict minerals);\n\u2013 provide information on environmental, health and safety matters such as safe usage and management of products across its lifecycle (including waste management);\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n\u2013 implement an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 or equivalent;\n\u2013 comply with the Company\u2019s anti-corruption and bribery requirements;\n\u2013 commit to apply and cascade in its supply chain the principles of the Company\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, including with regard to environment, human rights, labour practices, responsible sourcing of minerals and anti-corruption;\n\u2013 comply with the Company\u2019s sustainability requirements such as maturity assessment by an external expert company and completion of a questionnaire during the call-for-tender phase.\nThe Company\u2019s contractual requirements enable assessment of levels of suppliers\u2019 compliance.\nProcesses\nIn 2021, the SSCR Steering Committee agreed to anchor sustainability requirements into procurement processes of the Company. In 2022, the Company introduced sustainability in its supplier selection process. Sustainability is now one of the selection criteria in a call for tender. Suppliers are requested to fill in a sustainability questionnaire based on their governance and on the specific performance of the product or service the Company intends to source. The questionnaire notably requests information on certifications (e.g. environment, health and safety) and processes, as well as on resources used and on the impact of processes related to product manufacturing or service delivery.\nThis also includes the agreement from suppliers to regularly fulfil the evidence-based assessment on sustainability (see section Assessment above) and for the most important suppliers \u2013 based in part on annual spend with the Company \u2013 to be transparent on their climate change strategies (see section 5. \u201cCO2 emissions\u201d below). This will ultimately require suppliers to cooperate when a sustainability risk is identified, including with further analysis into the supplier\u2019s supply chain (see paragraph Contractual requirements above).\nSupplier Award and Dialogue\nThe Company is fostering suppliers\u2019 engagement through direct dialogue and values the commitment, contribution and efforts of its supply chain to improve on sustainability topics.\nIn 2022, the Company launched the first Airbus Supplier Sustainability Council establishing a framework to step-up collaboration within its supply chain on sustainability and fostering a new model of engagement with suppliers. The target is to launch concrete improvement initiatives co-led by representatives of the Company and of members of the council. The council will focus on areas such as decarbonisation, transparency and engagement acting as key enablers to accelerate specific initiatives from industry bodies such as IAEG and to share best practices across the full supply base.\nSustainability is a standard agenda item in regular reviews or conferences with suppliers, including the Annual Supplier Conference for the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business, the Defence and Space Division supplier conference or the Suppliers\u2019 councils. During these events, workshops take place to enable exchange on best practices and future collaboration.\nThe Company continues to give awards to its suppliers contributing positively to sustainability. In 2022, SABCA was awarded by the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business for its 5-year plan to cut CO2 emissions at its site by installing wind turbines, solar panels and optimising transportation of\n Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022 123\n\nDuring 2022, the Company has continued to implement its communication plan to raise awareness on the different pillars of its sustainability ambition amongst its employees, suppliers, and customers. In particular:\n\u2013 awareness sessions have been carried out in relation to the initiatives of the supply chain roadmap: for instance accompanying the deployment of the new sustainability questionnaire in calls for tender, or developing the ability of procurement operation teams to identify sustainability issues when visiting suppliers on-site;\n\u2013 communication activities in 2022 spread the key messages about the importance of sustainability. Internally, for instance, there was a presentation of the SSCR progress during the procurement annual roadshow, and a SSCR \u201cmarketplace\u201d during the annual sustainability town hall. Externally, the Company\u2019s CPO participated in the IAEG sponsor meeting about supplier assessment and development, as well as the Bundesverband f\u00fcr Materialwirtschaft, Einkaufe & Logistik (\u201cBME\u201d) conference in Berlin;\n\u2013 the toolkit presenting sustainability in the supply chain, deployed in 2021, targeting internal and external population, is regularly updated;\n\u2013 different additional communication means are being used such as: posters, kakemonos, a dedicated intranet website, participation in internal events promoting sustainability initiatives.\nGemba walk\nIn 2019, the Company introduced Supplier Factory Visits called \u201cthe Gemba Walk\u201d pocketbook, applicable to commercial aircraft activities, which is a practical and visual guide for the Company\u2019s employees when visiting the shop floor of a supplier, supporting the identification and reporting of risks or improvement opportunities observed during factory visits.\nWork With External Stakeholders\nThe Company is a founding member of IAEG, which is working on common aerospace industry standards and tools to manage environmental obligations. More specifically, for the supply chain, IAEG has developed:\n\u2013 a supply chain environmental survey, which the Company implemented in 2019 and which will be used as environmental assessment module, as mentioned in the section \u201cAssessment\u201d above;\n\u2013 an EMS implementation guideline to encourage a wider uptake of EMSs as appropriate for each supplier in a phased approach and cost effective, consistent and supportive manner;\n\u2013 the definition of an Environmental Qualification Program to assess and develop the environmental maturity of suppliers.\nUnder Company\u2019s leadership, the IAEG (initially focused on environment) extended its scope of actions to environmental, social and governance topics. In 2022, and co-led by the Company, a contract has been established between IAEG and the selected service provider to build a sectoral approach for supplier engagement and 2023 will be the year of deployment.\nAs a co-founder of the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (\u201cIFBEC\u201d), the Company is supporting the application of global standards for business ethics and compliance. IFBEC members have established a Model Supplier Code of Conduct which expresses the minimum ethical standards to be applied by suppliers throughout the aerospace and defence industries. It also encourages suppliers to go beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognised standards in order to advance in social and environmental responsibility and business ethics.\nAll suppliers are now being asked to sign a confirmation of compliance with the principles of the latest version of the Supplier Code of Conduct (or to confirm their own practices are aligned with the principles set out in this Code), and to cascade these principles throughout their own supply chains. The Company is committed to support suppliers, where necessary, to improve their own human rights due diligence.\nIn 2019, the Company joined the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s RMI, in order to further enforce activities of responsible sourcing while applying industry standards for supplier due diligence and data management in accordance with the OECD framework. In 2022, it decided to extend its membership to the whole Responsible Business Alliance (\u201cRBA\u201d) initiative.\nEU Taxonomy KPIs Accompanying Information\n1. Accounting Policy\nThe Company\u2019s EU Taxonomy disclosure covers the following scope: EU Taxonomy-compliant share of turnover, capital expenditure (\u201cCapEx\u201d) aligned with the EU Taxonomy and operational expenditure (\u201cOpEx\u201d) aligned with the EU Taxonomy of the Company consolidated that, for the purpose of EU Taxonomy disclosure, are split per economic activity according to the Climate Delegated Act and the Complementary Climate Delegated Act of the EU Taxonomy. Please refer to the \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 4: Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nIn the context of EU Taxonomy disclosure, the Company assessed any economic activity that in aggregate exceeds 1% of the total turnover, CapEx or OpEx. The materiality threshold has been set at 1%, as the Company expects economic activities that in aggregate do not exceed 1% of the total turnover, CapEx or OpEx to have no material influence on the reporting. However, should there be availability of data, the Company may choose to disclose such activities.\nTurnover, CapEx and OpEx were determined and allocated to the numerator by performing a mapping between the description of activities in the EU Taxonomy and the Company\u2019s portfolio of sources of revenues, investments and expenses.\nAs the EU Taxonomy KPIs are published for the first time in the reporting over FY 2022, prior-year figures are not provided. No material changes to the CapEx plan have occurred in FY 2022. The capital expenditures disclosed under the CapEx KPI are not part of a CapEx Plan meeting the conditions specified under the EU taxonomy regulation.\n2. Assessment of Compliance with EU Taxonomy Regulation\nInformation on Assessment of Compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe assessment of compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation has been carried out in four steps:\nIn light of the complexity and granularity of the applicable criteria, the investments could not be assessed as aligned by the Company in 2022. The Company took a cautious approach to assessing Appendix C criteria and compliance could not be confirmed in 2022.\nIn addition, some of the CapEx contributing to the Company\u2019s decarbonisation plan as presented in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.2 Climate Change\u201d could not be assessed as eligible.\nThe capital expenditures disclosed under the CapEx KPI are not part of a CapEx Plan meeting the conditions specified under the EU taxonomy Regulation.\n(1) Platform on Sustainable Finance \u2013 Final report on Minimum Safeguards, October 2022.\n 142 Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022\n  Contextual Information About the OpEx KPI\nThe Company\u2019s OpEx definition differs from the EU Taxonomy OpEx definition. For the purpose of the EU Taxonomy disclosure, only research and development costs are considered.\nFuture Developments\nIn the coming years, the Company will continue to report under the EU Taxonomy with regard to its Taxonomy-eligible economic activities as well as its Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. This entails a further and continuous review of our economic activities. Future guidance on the EU Taxonomy could result in updated definitions and other decision-making in meeting reporting obligations that may come into force. The Company expects that its reporting will evolve over time as more insights will be gained on how best to comply with the EU Taxonomy. If the delegated act related to the manufacturing of aircraft is adopted under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the turnover generated by sales of commercial aircraft may then become eligible.\nEstimated eligibility and alignment if aviation-related technical screening criteria were to be adopted as per draft recommendation: Pursuant to the Draft Recommendations, aviation-related activities are included in the EU Taxonomy by\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\nmeans of delegated act(s) to be adopted in 2023. The Company\u2019s commercial aircraft activity corresponding to NACE code 30.3 is described under section 7.2 Manufacturing of aircraft of the Draft Recommendations (1). According to the Draft Recommendations, a majority of the Company\u2019s 2022 turnover would be eligible, mainly including the turnover generated by sales of commercial aircraft. Based on the same information, the Company estimates that a significant portion of this eligible turnover could be Taxonomy-aligned, subject to Do-No-Significant-Harm criteria and minimum safeguards criteria assessment.

MBDA offers missile systems capabilities that cover the whole range of solutions for air dominance, ground-based air defence, maritime superiority and battlefield engagement. Beyond its role in European markets, MBDA has an established presence in export markets like Asia,\nThe broad product portfolio covers all five principal missile system categories: air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, anti-ship and surface-to-surface. MBDA\u2019s product range also includes a portfolio of airborne countermeasures such as missile warning and decoy systems and other customer support activities.\nThe most significant programmes currently under development are the next generation of the successful MICA air-to-air missile (Missile d'interception, de combat et d'autod\u00e9fense), the SPEAR 3 missile (Selected Precision Effects at Range Capability 3), the precision attack Brimstone 3 missile, the CAMM-ER missile (Common Anti-Air Modular Missile Extended Range), the Anglo-French joint initiative for a FC/ASW (Future Cruise / Anti- Ship Weapon), the development of Anti-ship weapons for the two nations, as well as the battlefield engagement MHT missile (Missile Haute Trame).\nRecent product upgrades also include the Aster Block 1 NT (New Technology), the air and missile defence systems for France and Italy, the Sea Venom / ANL (Anti-Navire L\u00e9ger) missile for the helicopters of the UK and French navies, as well as the Enforcer/ MMP (Missile Moyenne Port\u00e9e) missile for the battlefield.\nFurther activities include the preparation of hypersonic and direct energy applications/systems for future programmes such as FCAS and Tempest, the production of various aircraft packages for the Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale existing programmes (including ASRAAM, MICA NT, and Meteor BVRAAM), as well as the production of various packages for frigates and corvettes systems/missiles (including Aster B1, CAMM, VL MICA, Marte ER and Otomat).\nArianeGroup\nAirbus Defence and Space is active in the field of launchers and launch services through its ArianeGroup joint venture, which prior to July 2017 was named Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL).\nArianeGroup is responsible for the coordination and programme management of civil activities of the launcher business and relevant participations that have been transferred. ArianeGroup owns a total 74% stake in Arianespace, 46% of Starsem and 51% of Eurockot, providing a complete range of launch services with the Ariane, Vega and Rockot launchers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Insurance Risk Management function (\u201cIRM\u201d) is established to proactively and efficiently respond to risks that can be treated by insurance techniques. IRM is responsible for all corporate insurance activities and related protection for the Company and is empowered to deal directly with the insurance and re-insurance markets via the Company\u2019s inhouse broker entity. IRM\u2019s continuous objective in 2022 was to further implement and improve efficient and appropriate corporate and project-related insurance solutions.\nIRM\u2019s mission includes the definition and implementation of the Company\u2019s strategy for insurance risk management to help ensure that harmonised insurance policies and standards are in place for all insurable risks worldwide for the Company. A systematic review, monitoring and reporting procedure applicable to all Divisions is in place to assess the exposure and protection systems applicable to all the Company\u2019s sites. The Company\u2019s insurance programmes cover high risk exposures related to its assets and liabilities.\nAsset and liability insurance policies underwritten by IRM for the Company cover risks such as property damage, business interruption, cyber, aviation and non-aviation general and product liability. IRM also provides a Group insurance policy for Supervisory and Managing Board Members and certain\nother employees of the Company. The Company follows a policy of seeking to transfer the insurable risk of the Company to external insurance markets at reasonable conditions, on customised and sufficient terms and limits as provided by the international insurance markets. A difficult global corporate insurance environment remained in 2022 due to economical and geopolitical situations and the corporate insurers have maintained their underwriting strategy for large corporations, however, Airbus\u2019 positive outlook and insurance strategy allowed to differentiate the impact on insurance policies.\nAirbus is, with other European companies, one of the founding members of the cyber insurance mutual Miris dedicated to cyber risks. Miris will participate in the cyber group insurance policy in 2023.\nThe insurance industry and some risk factors impact on the Company\u2019s risk remain unpredictable and most Group insurance policies are renewed on an annual basis. There may be further demands to change scope of coverage, premiums and deductible amounts. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its current levels of coverage nor that the insurance policies in place are adequate to cover all significant risk exposure of the Company.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in various governmental, legal and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, the most significant of which are described below. Other than as described below, there are no material governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened) which may have or have had in the recent past significant effects on Airbus SE\u2019s or the Company\u2019s Financial Position or profitability.\nRegarding the Company\u2019s provisions policy, the Company recognises provisions for litigation and claims when (i) it has a present obligation from legal actions, governmental investigations, proceedings and other claims resulting from past events that are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against the Company, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle such obligation and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of such obligation can be made. Although the Company believes that adequate provisions have been made to cover current or contemplated general and specific litigation and regulatory risks, no assurance can be provided that such provisions will be sufficient. For the amount of provisions for litigation and claims, please refer to the \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 25: Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities\u201d.\nIf the Company concludes that the disclosures relative to contingent liabilities can be expected to prejudice seriously its position in a dispute with other parties, the Company limits its disclosures to the nature of the dispute.\nInvestigation by the UK SFO,\nFrance\u2019s PNF, US Departments of State and Justice and Related Commercial Litigation\nThe Company reached final agreements (\u201cthe agreements\u201d) with the French Parquet National Financier (\u201cPNF\u201d), the UK Serious Fraud Office (\u201cSFO\u201d), and the US Department of Justice (\u201cDoJ\u201d) resolving the authorities\u2019 investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption, as well as with the US Department of State (\u201cDoS\u201d) and the DoJ to resolve their investigations into inaccurate and misleading filings made with the DoS pursuant to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d). The agreements were approved and made public on 31 January 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company agreed to pay penalties of \u20ac3,597,766,766 plus interest and costs to the French, UK and US authorities. This was recognised in the Company\u2019s 2019 accounts. The settlements with each authority were as follows: PNF \u20ac2,083,137,455, the SFO \u20ac983,974,311, the DoJ \u20ac526,150,496 and the DoS \u20ac9,009,008 of which \u20ac4,504,504 May be used for approved remedial compliance measures. All penalties have been paid.\nUnder the terms of the Convention judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public (\u201cCJIP\u201d) with the PNF, the Company has an obligation to submit its compliance programme to targeted audits carried out by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise Anticorruption (\u201cAFA\u201d) over a period of three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the SFO, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on the Company in light of the continuing monitorship to be conducted by the AFA.\nUnder the terms of the DPA with the DoJ, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on Airbus under the agreement with the DoJ, but the Company will periodically report on its continuing compliance enhancement progress during the three year term of the DPA and carry out further reviews as required by the DoJ.\nThe agreements resulted in the suspension of prosecution for a duration of three years. This deferral period ended on 31 January 2023. The Company awaits the formal determination by the authorities that it has complied with the agreements\u2019 terms throughout the period whereupon it expects the closure of the prosecutions in line with the procedural requirements of each country. On 13 February 2023, the SFO gave notice to the Company discontinuing the prosecution. On 17 March 2023, the PNF gave notice of the same with receipt of the Constat de l'extinction de l'action publique.\nUnder the terms of the Consent Agreement with the DoS, the DoS has agreed to settle all civil violations of the ITAR outlined in the Company\u2019s voluntary disclosures identified in the Consent Agreement, and the Company has agreed to retain an independent export control compliance officer, who will monitor the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s export control systems and its compliance with the ITAR for a duration of three years.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s decision to redirect export control compliance resources to ensure compliance with export control restrictions and international sanctions announced against Russia, Belarus and certain Russian entities and individuals following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Company asked the DoS to extend the Consent Agreement by nine months. The DoS has granted the extension. The Company does not expect the Consent Agreement extension to have an impact on the DPAs with the SFO and DoJ, nor on the CJIP with the PNF, nor on the AFA\u2019s monitorship, as those are independent of the DoS\u2019s civil compliance programme review.\nAny breach of the terms of the agreements by the Company could lead to rescission by the authorities of the terms of the agreements and reopening of the prosecutions. Prosecution could result in the imposition of further monetary penalties or other sanctions including additional tax liability and could have a material impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nIn addition to any pending investigation in other jurisdictions, the factual disclosures made in the course of reaching the agreements may result in the commencement of additional investigations in other jurisdictions. Such investigations could also result in (i) civil claims or claims by shareholders against the Company, (ii) adverse consequences on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain or continue financing for current or future projects, (iii) limitations on the eligibility of group companies for certain public sector contracts, and/or (iv) damage to the Company\u2019s business or reputation via negative publicity adversely affecting the Company\u2019s prospects in the commercial market place.\nAirbus will continue to cooperate with the authorities in the future, pursuant to the agreements and to enhance its strong Ethics & Compliance culture within the Company.\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.1 Presentation of the Company\nSeveral consultants and other third parties have initiated commercial litigation and arbitration against the Company seeking relief. The agreements reached with authorities may lead to additional commercial litigation and arbitration against the Company and tax liability in the future, which could have a material impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn August 2020, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in US federal court in the state of New Jersey against Airbus SE and members of its current and former management. The Company was served with the complaint in the fourth quarter of 2021. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of alleged shareholders that purchased or otherwise acquired Airbus SE securities in the US between 24 February 2016 and 30 July 2020, and asserted violations of US securities laws. The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements or omissions concerning, among other things, the Company\u2019s agreements approved on 31 January 2020 with the French PNF, the UK SFO, the US DoJ and the US DoS as well as the Company\u2019s historic practices regarding the use of third party business partners and anti-corruption compliance. The matter was fully and finally settled on 30 September 2022 in exchange for a payment in the amount of $5,000,000 USD without any acknowledgement of liability.\nIn addition, the Company received notification in August 2021 of two separate claims and in March 2022 a third claim, all alleging similar facts as the US class action. Three claims have been filed in the Netherlands purportedly on behalf of Airbus investors.\nThe first Dutch claim was filed in August 2021 by a special purpose vehicle incorporated under the laws of Guernsey, an assignee purportedly representing numerous private shareholders and institutional investors, seeking a declaratory judgment with damages to be assessed in follow on proceedings. This claim is now pending before the Amsterdam District Court.\nThe second Dutch claim was filed in December 2021 following a demand letter sent by a foundation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, a purported representative of unnamed institutional and retail investors worldwide, starting a class action against the Company before the Dutch courts. This second Dutch claim targets the Company, certain of the Company\u2019s current and former directors and officers, and the Company\u2019s current and former auditors.\nThe third Dutch claim was a class action filed in April 2022 against the Company by a foundation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. In accordance with Dutch procedural law, the two Dutch class action claims are treated jointly as one case.\nThe Dutch claims allege that the Company violated its reporting obligations by failing to adequately inform investors and providing false or misleading information about its use of intermediaries and alleged corrupt practices, its related financial exposure, internal investigations and subsequent measures taken by the Company, and related criminal investigations, which allegedly impacted the Company\u2019s share price.\nThe Company cannot exclude the possibility that additional claims are filed related to this subject matter attempting different theories of recovery in the same or different jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company believes it has solid grounds to defend itself against the allegations. The consequences of such litigation and the outcome of the proceedings cannot be fully assessed at this stage, but any judgment or decision unfavourable to the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nAir France Flight 447 Trial\nOn 1 June 2009, an A330 operated by Air France flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean with 228 persons onboard. The wreckage was located in April 2011 after several search campaigns organised by the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses (\u201cBEA\u201d), which published its final investigation report in July 2012. In the wake of the accident, the prosecutor in Paris opened an investigation for involuntary manslaughter and Airbus SAS was charged in March 2011. In September 2019, the investigating magistrates closed the investigation and dismissed all criminal charges after a thorough analysis of the technical and legal elements of the case. However, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned the magistrates\u2019 decision and ordered trial for involuntary manslaughter. The Company\u2019s appeal to the French Supreme Court has been dismissed. The trial took place in the fourth quarter of 2022. The prosecutor recommended a dismissal of all criminal charges against Air France and Airbus. The judgment of the Paris Criminal Court expected on 17 April 2023, if unfavourable to the Company, could result in damage to its business or reputation.\nQatar Airways Commercial Litigation\nCiting surface degradation on some of its A350 fleet and alleging an underlying \u201cdesign defect\u201d, Qatar Airways filed a legal claim against the Company in the London Commercial Court on 17 December 2021. On 1 February 2023, the parties announced they had reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal dispute over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. The parties have proceeded to discontinue their legal claims. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability for either party. The parties have also agreed terms for the delivery of 50 A321 and 23 A350 aircraft.\nGrand Canyon Helicopter Accident\nOn 10 February 2018, a fatal accident occurred in the Grand Canyon at a site called Quartermaster in Arizona involving an EC130 B4 helicopter operated by Papillon Helicopters impacting the canyon floor and catching fire, leading to five fatalities and two severely injured persons. Following the accident, product liability claims were filed in Nevada state court in the US, including claims by the estate and parents of a deceased passenger and by the injured pilot of the helicopter. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims, but such claims may generate negative publicity and reputational harm. The trial is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2024. Any judgment or decision unfavourable to the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company as well as on its reputation.\nOther Investigations\nThe Company cooperated fully with the authorities in relation to three investigations initiated by independent magistrates in France concerning the activities of commercial intermediaries in Libya, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and several Eastern European countries. In recognition of the fulsome nature of the cooperation and upon payment of a penalty of \u20ac15.8 million, all three investigations were closed by means of a Convention judiciaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (\u201cCJIP\u201d) with the PNF on 30 November 2022. This ends all remaining prosecutions in France for similar historical activities.\nIn 2019, the Company self-reported to German authorities potentially improper advance receipt and communication of confidential customer information by employees of Airbus Defence and Space GmbH. The information concerned relates to future German government procurement projects. The self- disclosure by the Company followed an internal review with the support of an external law firm. Both the German Ministry of Defence and the Munich public prosecutor opened an investigation into the matter. The investigation could have an impact on Airbus Defence and Space GmbH\u2019s and Airbus Secure Land Communications GmbH\u2019s ability to participate in future public procurement projects in Germany. In 2021 the Munich prosecution issued a penalty notice against Airbus Defence and Space GmbH for \u20ac 10 million for negligent violation of supervisory duties in connection with this matter. The Company continues to fully cooperate with relevant authorities.\nConscious of the strategic importance of sustainability, the Company has defined governance at the highest level. Oversight has been established at the Board of Directors level with the Ethics, Compliance and Sustainability Committee (\u201cECSC\u201d). For further information about the ECSC, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.1 Management and Control\u201d. The ECSC is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors to oversee the Company\u2019s:\n\u2013 Culture and commitment to ethical business, integrity and sustainability;\n\u2013 Ethics and Compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of ethics and compliance, including all associated internal policies, procedures and controls; and\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n\u2013 Sustainability strategy and effective governance to ensure that sustainability-related topics are taken into account in the Company\u2019s strategy and objectives.\nUnder the Board Rules, the Board of Directors delegates the day-to-day management of the Company to the CEO, who, supported by the Executive Committee, makes decisions with respect to the management of the Company, including sustainability. The Executive Committee has the responsibility to provide top level expectations and direction, while overseeing and validating the sustainability strategy. This entails validating sustainability targets, including those integrated into the Top Company Objectives.\nThis graphic represents the organizational structure for governance related to ethics, compliance, and sustainability within a company. At the top, there is the \"Board of Directors\" which oversees the \"Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee.\" Directly below the Board of Directors, there is an \"Executive Committee\" which is connected to several specialized boards. These boards are the \"Environment Executive Steering Committee,\" \"Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Board,\" \"Product Safety Board,\" \"Occupational Health and Safety Governance Board,\" and \"Human Rights, Business Integrity, Sustainable Supply Chain\" board. The last board listed has a direct line indicating that topics are cascaded directly to the Executive Committee. This structure is designed to ensure oversight and accountability in various key areas of corporate governance.\nThis graphic represents the organizational structure for governance related to ethics, compliance, and sustainability within a company. At the top, there is the \"Board of Directors\" which oversees the \"Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee.\" Directly below the Board of Directors, there is an \"Executive Committee\" which is connected to several specialized boards.

The last board listed has a direct line indicating that topics are cascaded directly to the Executive Committee. This structure is designed to ensure oversight and accountability in various key areas of corporate governance.\nThe Executive Committee is supported by several committees or boards linked to the Company\u2019s four sustainability commitments:\n\u2013 the Environment Executive Steering Committee, the Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Board, the Product Safety Board as well as the Occupational Health and Safety Governance Board (created in 2022; see \u201c\u2013 1.2.9 Health and Safety\u201d), all chaired\nby Executive Committee members;\n\u2013 the Steering Committees of the Human Rights and Sustainable\nSupply Chain Roadmaps, both sponsored by Executive Committee members.\nOther sustainability topics such as business integrity are brought directly to the attention of the Executive Committee. Where relevant, additional elements of governance linked to specific topics are explained in the governance sections of this report.\nOrganisation and policy framework: The sustainability & environment team put in place in January 2020 at corporate level has continued to develop and expand. Its mission continues to focus on:\n- Setting the ambition level regarding the Company\u2019s environmental and social commitments;\n- Identifying the levers to achieve this ambition;\n- Enabling the business to deliver this ambition across the\nfull value chain;\n- Engaging employees on sustainability;\n- Providing clarity on ambition and progress to internal and external stakeholders;\n- Coordinating with relevant functions the performance and reporting on progress with regards to the four commitments.\nWhile the sustainability & environment team has a Company-wide role to provide direction and check regularly on advancements across all sustainability topics, there are for each of those topics (e.g. health and safety, inclusion and diversity, human rights, etc.), related functions, departments or \u201croadmaps\u201d (multi-functional teams addressing cross-functional sustainability topics) driving\ntheir continuous improvement. These teams are for the most part supported by dedicated policies which are referred to in the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct \u2013 a single reference intended to guide daily behaviour and help employees resolve the most common ethical and compliance issues that they may encounter. The Code of Conduct applies to all of the Company\u2019s employees and directors, regardless of their job title, responsibilities, seniority, or location, within every subsidiary or joint venture where the Company has control.\nIncentivisation and remuneration: The Company also believes the integration of sustainability criteria into its reward mechanisms is an important enabler for accelerating its sustainability ambition. A sustainability criterion is integrated into the common collective component of the CEO\u2019s variable remuneration, accounting for 20%, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.2.1 Remuneration Policy\u201d. This principle also applies to the other members of the Executive Committee who do not serve on the Board of Directors, and to a large extent to executives and \u201cLevel IV\u201d managers employed at the Company. Other criteria also apply to all employees as summarised below:\nVII. Airbus\u2019 Way Forward: Vigilance Plan\nThe Company is determined to conduct its business responsibly and with integrity. It is convinced that promoting responsible business conduct within its value chain is key to sustainable growth. The Company\u2019s vigilance plan includes measures to identify risks and prevent serious impacts related to sustainability resulting from the Company\u2019s own operations and from its suppliers and other contractors (including subcontractors). As far as its own operations are concerned, the Company has adopted internal policies and management tools to perform the monitoring, assessment, mitigation and reporting of risk and compliance allegations, which are embedded into the Company\u2019s culture and processes. For the Company\u2019s vigilance plan for its supply chain, see \u201c\u2013 1.2.15 Responsible Supply Chain\u201d, which shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference and form part of this plan.\nEnterprise risk management and internal audit:With regards to risk management, sustainability risks and opportunities are fully embedded in the Company\u2019s ERM system. For further information on ERM, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.1.3 Enterprise Risk Management System\u201d. For further information on the Company\u2019s risks, see \u201c\u2013 Risk Factors\u201d. Internal audits are also performed regularly across the Company, including on sustainability topics. External audits are performed in line with certification requirements, as detailed in the related material topic sections.\nSustainability competencies and employee engagement:\nRaising awareness, developing competencies and engaging employees are essential to preventing and mitigating sustainability risks and maximising opportunities. On this matter, the Company offered employees more than 900 online and in- person training opportunities in 2022, ranging from ethics and compliance to export control, health and safety, product safety, cyber security, internal controls, inclusion and diversity, quality and customer centricity, sustainability awareness and more. Training courses linked to sustainability topics were integrated into the 2022 mandatory training list for Company employees. Specific information on training is covered in the related material topic sections.\nAffiliates: All Company controlled affiliates are expected to deploy similar internal policies by applying the Company\u2019s directives. A company-wide single directive defines rules, processes and procedures applicable to the Company\u2019s affiliates and their respective boards, directors and officers. Its enforcement is supported by the Directors\u2019 training programme which was delivered to 117 people in 2022 over eight full-day digital sessions, as well as on-boarding sessions performed for newly appointed managing directors of controlled affiliates. The single directive assists the Company\u2019s affiliates in effectively fulfilling their responsibilities, while assuring the Company\u2019s ongoing commitment to high standards of corporate governance. It was built on the basis of Company related internal policies including, but not limited to: the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, International Framework Agreement, Agreement on the European Works Council, Supplier Code of Conduct, Health & Safety Policy, Environmental Policy, the Company\u2019s Anti-Corruption Policy and related directives. An online Internal Controls Self Assessment (\u201cICSA\u201d) is completed on an annual basis by the controlled affiliates to self-assess their internal controls, including how they relate to the environment, health and safety, human resources, governance, finance, procurement and compliance requirements in order to identify any gaps and define remedial action plans as required. Controlled affiliates can update the self-assessment on a quarterly basis based on their progression. Following ICSA, internal verifications are carried out by the respective corporate functions to validate answers and, when gaps are identified, develop improvement measures jointly with controlled affiliates to enhance their conformity level. In 2022, 81 controlled affiliates were selected to perform such verifications. Verifications are run every three years at least, and more frequently when ICSAs evidence material gaps. The Company\u2019s controlled affiliates are also asked to regularly evaluate risks via the Company\u2019s ERM system, and to regularly monitor them as part of their risk assessment process.\nThe Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance programme seeks to ensure that the Company\u2019s business practices conform to applicable laws, regulations and ethical business principles, as well as reinforcing a culture of integrity and speak-up. In 2022, Ethics & Compliance continued to be a top priority for the Company. In its list of priorities for the year, the Company set the objective to Speak Up, Listen Up and act with integrity and respect.\nThe Company has worked over the past several years to develop an Ethics & Compliance programme that is structured around the following key risk areas: Business Ethics / Anti-Corruption\nCompliance, Export Compliance and Privacy. Each of these areas is, in turn, supported by dedicated compliance policies and a team responsible for their implementation, together with the identification and proposal of new measures to adapt to a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.\nImproving the Ethics & Compliance programme remains a constant and ongoing process, in cooperation with other functions within the Company, in order to sustain and capitalise on its values.\nSDGs Others\n\nII. Governance\nThe Ethics & Compliance organisation is part of the Legal Department under the ultimate responsibility of the Company\u2019s General Counsel. The aim is to provide strong governance throughout the Company with the global presence of qualified Compliance officers who ensure the Ethics & Compliance programme is implemented consistently in the different functional and operational areas.\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, who reports to both the General Counsel and the ECSC of the Board of Directors, leads a dedicated team of Compliance professionals who are responsible for supporting and advising across the Company on compliance related topics, supporting the day-to- day business, performing risk assessments, drafting policies, conducting third party due diligence, investigating compliance\nallegations, implementing tools and controls and delivering compliance training.\nThe ECSC also plays a key role in the oversight and continued development of the Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of Ethics & Compliance.\nIn addition to the dedicated Compliance professionals, the Company is coordinating a network of part-time Ethics & Compliance Representatives (\u201cECRs\u201d), spanning all Divisions, functions, and regions. The number of ECRs slightly increased in 2022, with a total of 373 ECRs at the end of 2022 (compared to 340 at the end of 2021). Although the ECR network members are not compliance experts, they play an important role in promoting\nhe Ethics & Compliance programme and culture and serve as points of contact for any employee who has questions about the Ethics & Compliance programme or wishes to raise an Ethics & Compliance concern, including but not limited to bribery or corruption. The Ethics & Compliance team animates the ECR network, providing continuous training and information to the ECRs.\nIn February 2022, the Company launched the Export Control Points of Contact (\u201cEPoCs\u201d) network, spanning all Divisions, functions, and regions. Similar to ECRs, EPoCs are not export control experts but serve as \u201cfirst line of defence\u201d and the \u201cgo-to\u201d individuals for export control matters. On the occasion of the launch, the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer stated that \u201cby raising awareness among employees and acting as local focal points for queries on Export Control- related topics in their respective functions, EPoCs will be key contributors to the Company\u2019s common objective: embed an export control compliance system and culture throughout Company\u2019s businesses.\u201d By the end of 2022, the network was established and active within the business, with a total of 570 EPOCs.\nLikewise, the Personal Data Protection Officer (\u201cDPO\u201d) relies on a team of privacy experts to guide, train and advise the business with respect to privacy requirements, and a network of Privacy Focal Points in the business functions and affiliates, to support the Airbus privacy programme.\nIII. RiskManagement\nThe Company is required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world where it conducts business. This includes countries perceived as presenting an increased risk of corruption.\nAccordingly, the Company conducts a thorough bribery and corruption risk assessment across its two Divisions and different businesses annually. The results of this risk assessment are embedded and monitored within the Company\u2019s ERM framework and highlight, among others, the risk of improper payments being made to or via third parties such as sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors, suppliers, distributors and joint venture or offset partners. Further corruption risks include the use of sponsorships, donations, or political contributions to improperly benefit decision-makers, or the provision of excessive or overly frequent gifts and hospitality by Company employees.\nIn order to ensure its compliance with Export Control regulations and laws in the European Union, US and internationally, the Company continues to strengthen its Export Control compliance programme to ensure it is fit for purpose. Where risks are identified, they are embedded and monitored in the Company\u2019s ERM. Identified risks include potential unauthorised access to export-controlled data and hardware by third parties and non-compliance with the ITAR.\nRegarding privacy, the Company undertakes privacy impact assessments depending on the nature of the personal data processed or scale of the processing. In addition, risks relating to the protection of personal data are also assessed in the context of the ERM and kept updated.\nSpecific directives have been adopted to address the Company\u2019s key compliance risk areas. These include among others:\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance organisation is charged with oversight and monitoring of these directives to ensure that they are being implemented effectively. Periodic controls on key processes are performed and reports provided to the Company\u2019s Executive Committee and the ECSC, including recommendations to strengthen the Ethics & Compliance programme where necessary.\nIn addition, the Corporate Audit & Forensic Department conducts periodic, independent audits of the Company\u2019s compliance processes to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures and allow the Company to develop action plans for strengthening such controls.\nIV. Implementation/Activities\nAwareness and Training\nAs part of their annual goals & objectives, all Company employees are required to undergo a minimum amount of compliance training via e-learning. Additionally, depending on the function, the country and the level of risk implied by their role, certain employees are selected to attend live classroom training as well, including on Anti Bribery & Corruption and Export Control. Attendance in such cases is mandatory, and managers have a responsibility to ensure that their team members do so. Exposed employees are also required to complete regular training refreshers.\nFrom 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, the Company\u2019s employees followed 290,178 Ethics & Compliance e-learning sessions, including on bribery, corruption and export control. Furthermore, 4,699 employees attended live classroom training\nn different Ethics & Compliance topics over the period, the majority of which were delivered in virtual classroom settings due to the pandemic.\nLikewise, the Company also delivered anti-bribery and corruption training towards higher risk third parties, including sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors. In 2022, 100% of higher risk third parties were trained on Ethics & Compliance requirements and expectations.\nThe Company continued the roll out of the privacy e-learning as part of the Ethics & Compliance compulsory training catalogue. 3,181 privacy training sessions were performed in 2022 (reporting period from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022).\nSpeak-Up Channel: OpenLine\nThe Company recognises that the Code of Conduct cannot address every challenging situations that may arise, and therefore encourages its employees to speak-up through various channels, including through OpenLine (available at https://www. airbusopenline.com). The OpenLine enables users to submit an alert securely and confidentially, and also to ask questions related to Ethics & Compliance.\nThe Company protects those who speak up and raise concerns appropriately and in good faith. The Company does not retaliate against anyone who raises a concern, or against those who assist in investigations of suspected violations.\n847 investigative requests received in 2022\n524\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\nIn addition, the dataprotection@airbus.com mailbox is systematically published in the Company\u2019s privacy policies and information notices specific to the various applications, to ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights and/or lodge complaints.\nTo further increase awareness about Speak-Up, in 2022, the Ethics & Compliance team conducted an analysis of the results from the Company\u2019s internal survey \u201cMy Working Environment\u201d to identify opportunities to continuously foster a Speak Up culture. This analysis led to the launch of additional initiatives throughout the Company to promote Speak-Up culture, including the development of a Speak-Up team talk in January 2022, which was shared with all managers to help them raise the importance of speaking-up with their teams. A simplified version of this \u201cteam talk\u201d was designed and deployed within the shop floor community.\nIn 2022, the Company received a total of 847 investigative requests of which 524 were HR related. Cases requiring investigation are managed by dedicated members of the Ethics & Compliance team in accordance with an internal method for the conduct of Investigations. The Ethics & Compliance team provides regular updates to the pool of internal investigators, on internal policies, recent developments in the regulatory framework, and recurring reminders on investigation best practices to ensure the consistent deployment of compliance investigations across the entire Company.\nIn some instances, the Company may engage outside counsel for support, depending on the nature of the investigation.\nThe Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee and other relevant stakeholders (including relevant authorities, if applicable, and Company\u2019s local management teams) are briefed regarding the progress and outcome of internal investigations on a regular basis.\nPolicies and Procedures\nIn 2022, the Company continued to improve its policies and procedures framework, by issuing a guidance on third parties categorisation, for example, and translating the Code of Conduct into seven additional languages to maximise the reach of this foundational document. All policies and guidelines are made available to employees on the Intranet, and classroom training\nis delivered to employees who are particularly exposed to the underlying risks as described above.\nOn the Export Control side, the Company has cascaded its Export Control requirements through nine Directives and Methods throughout the Company. The cascading triggered an update of the relevant business processes and was completed in Summer 2022.\nIn 2021 and 2022, as required under the Consent Agreement, two audits of the Company\u2019s ITAR compliance programme were undertaken by external counsels. Please refer to \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 39: Litigation and Claims\u201d (Investigation by the SFO, PNF, DoJ, DoS, Related Commercial Litigation).\nResponsible Lobbying Charter\nThe Company is committed to ensuring that any lobbying activity is undertaken in compliance with all applicable laws and its anti-corruption programme. In 2021, the Company launched a Responsible Lobbying Charter aimed at anybody who engages with public officials in any capacity, including third party representatives retained by the Company. The Charter outlines the Company\u2019s core principles for responsible lobbying and brings together the Company\u2019s key codes and directives relevant to this topic. The principles are also reinforced by a training module available to all employees.\n1.2.15 Responsible Supply Chain\nI. Introduction\nV. Outlook\nAn effective Ethics & Compliance programme is one that, by definition, continuously adapts to changes and improves over time. Going forward, the Company will continue to assess its risks and monitor and test the implementation of mitigation measures at all levels: corporate level, Divisions, regions and local entities.\nWhen misconduct reveals a gap in compliance policies, procedures or tools, the Company undertakes revisions to its Ethics & Compliance programme commensurate with the wrongdoing and in light of lessons learned. While compliance at the Company will therefore always be a work in progress, the Company is committed to this endeavour, as it aims to make its Ethics & Compliance programme sustainable over time.\nWhile the Company\u2019s products and services are sold all over the world, the majority of its supply chain is based in Europe and OECD countries. However, in the past few years, the supply chain has become concentrated and more international. In addition, and due to increasing consolidation within the aerospace and defence sector, larger work packages are being placed with a smaller number of lead suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s global sourcing footprint is represented as follows based on Tier one suppliers only.\nTo promote further globalisation of its sourcing footprint, the Company has established regional procurement offices in North America (Herndon, VA), India (Bangalore), Asia Pacific (Singapore) and China (Beijing). The regional procurement offices represent the Procurement function in the respective regions. They are responsible for strategic sourcing, general procurement and supplier development (procurement operations) while supporting the application of the Company\u2019s procurement process and policy and digital solutions. As the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business and its two Divisions are certified ISO 14001, the Procurement function acts in adherence with ISO 14001 requirements.\nII. Governance\nThe Company\u2019s sustainable supply chain ambition is built on four pillars: \u201clead the journey towards clean aerospace, respect human rights and foster inclusion, build our business on the foundation of safety and quality, exemplify business integrity\u201d.\nDerived from this ambition, the Company\u2019s Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap is based on a three-step approach; supplier\ncommitment, supplier assessment, supplier engagement & development.\nThe Company strives to make environmental and social responsibility a core element of its procurement strategy. This includes managing the relationships with suppliers throughout the sourcing strategy, supplier selection, contract management and supplier monitoring and development. The Company\u2019s suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, all business shall be conducted by suppliers in compliance with the principles of the Company\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, which is the document of reference for the Company\u2019s responsible supplier management. This Supplier Code of Conduct integrates the group-wide values and principles in line with internationally recognised standards and conventions (such as OECD and ILO).\nIn order to drive the Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap (\u201cSSCR\u201d), a monthly Steering Committee chaired by the Head of Sustainability & Environment, and the Head of Procurement Governance & Strategy and the representative of the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company is implemented. The Steering Committee includes Chief Procurement Officers of Airbus Helicopters and of Airbus Defence and Space, as well as the Head of Health & Safety, the Head of Product Safety and the Head of Ethics & Compliance, or their nominated representatives. The EVP Communication and Corporate Affairs and the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company act as sponsors of the SSCR. In addition, the Head of Procurement Governance and Strategy is part of the Procurement Leadership Team and is responsible for facilitating the communication on sustainability activities between the SSCR and the Procurement Leadership Team on a regular basis.\nIn 2022 the SSCR Steering Committee validated the annual planning and quarterly reviewed the progress of its SSCR implementation notably regarding the assessment of suppliers\u2019 sustainability practices as well as the reinforcement of the engagement with suppliers. On top of those forums, the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company also reports to the ECSC on the progress of the Company\u2019s responsible sourcing strategy implementation.\nConcrete sustainability targets have been included in the 2022 objectives of the Company\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer (\u201cCPO\u201d) and are directly linked to the CPO\u2019s variable pay and cascaded through the Company\u2019s Procurement organisations:\n\u2013 commitment by suppliers to Airbus Supplier Code of Conduct for 85% of the 2021 sourcing volume;\n\u2013 supplier sustainability assessments completed for 50% of the 2021 sourcing volume;\n\u2013 response of suppliers to CDP assessment for 75% of the 2021 sourcing volume.\nAll sustainability activities in the supply chain are based on the following key elements and principles of due diligence following the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct:\n\u2013 supply base risk mapping;\n\u2013 supplier engagement and contractual requirements; \u2013 supplier assessment/audits and development plans; \u2013 policies, tools and reporting.\nFor any anti-corruption topics in the supply chain, the Procurement function cooperates closely with the Legal & Compliance department. The Company has also engaged into a plan to further develop its due diligence mechanisms (see IV. Due Diligence in the supply chain).\nThose priorities are consistent with the most material topics identified in the Company\u2019s supply chain.\nIII. RiskManagement\nThe Company\u2019s procurement-related risks and opportunities are embedded into the Company\u2019s ERM process. Risks and opportunities related to the deployment of the sustainability roadmap in the supply chain are managed according to the Procurement ERM plan and detailed hereafter.\n1. Impact on the Company\u2019s Reputation\nAny industrial accident or other serious incident in the supply chain, or any problems of the supplier to fulfil its operational or product compliance may have a significant adverse effect on the reputation of the Company and its products and services. The Company\u2019s reputation may also be affected by the public perception of social and/or environmental impacts of its supply chain\u2019s industrial operations on local environments, communities, biodiversity and the general public\u2019s health.\n2. Impact on the Local Environment\nFrom the extraction of raw materials to the manufacturing of parts delivered to the Company, a supplier\u2019s industrial operations may have significant adverse environmental impacts on the local environment where the activity is performed, with possible impacts on air, water, soil, biodiversity, workers\u2019 occupational health and safety, on the health of the general public, on the land rights of the local or indigenous communities and on forced and child labour (see salient risks in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.10 Human Rights\u201d).\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n3. Business Disruption Risk\nIn the event of a supplier failing to comply with environmental, human/labour rights, health and safety laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the levying of civil or criminal penalties and fines against the supplier. Regulatory authorities may require them to conduct investigations and undertake remedial activities, curtail operations or close installations or facilities temporarily to prevent imminent risks.\n4. Risk of Product Non-Compliance\nThe various products manufactured and sold by suppliers must comply with applicable environmental, human/labour rights, health and safety laws and regulations, for example those covering substances and product composition. Even if a supplier seeks to ensure that its products meet the highest quality standards, increasingly stringent and complex laws and regulations, new scientific discoveries, delivery of defective products or the obligation to notify or provide regulatory authorities or others with required information (such as under the REACH regulation) may force it to adapt, redesign, redevelop, recertify and/or remove its products from the market. Seizures of defective products may be pronounced and could prevent delivery to the Company. In response, a Procurement Task Force has been established to ensure group-wide governance for supplier management and assessment of chemical regulations and obsolescence impact. This task force also coordinates communication to suppliers on substance issues and on substitution solutions qualified by the Company.\nIn this frame, the Company provided to its supply chain a dedicated Tool Kit on \u201cREACH Substances \u2013 Certain Requirements & Substitution programmes\u201d. This tool kit reminds the main principles of the REACH regulation as Authorisation, Restrictions and Substitutions programmes in order to raise the attention of the supply chain on these challenges.\nIn response to the above 1. to 4., the Company deploys responsible sourcing activities and specific supplier due diligence actions in the frame of the SSCR.\nIV. SupplyChainVigilancePlan\n1. Due Diligence in the Supply Chain\nIn 2022 the Company launched a project aimed at reinforcing due diligence in its supply chain. The outcomes of the project will be rolled out in 2023. Activities under this project cover primarily the Company\u2019s own suppliers; nonetheless, if an alert raised is linked to an upstream supplier, the Company will act on it as appropriate.\nAlert and Grievance Mechanism\nFrom 2019, the Company\u2019s OpenLine has been accessible to external stakeholders, such as suppliers and their employees. For further information on OpenLine, see \u201c\u2013 1.2.14 Business Integrity\u201d. Access to OpenLine has been reiterated in the revised Supplier Code of Conduct.\nIn addition to OpenLine, the Company\u2019s sustainable supply chain team may receive alerts from other sources including through the supplier onboarding process, media or directly from employees. During 2022, the sustainable supply chain roadmap received alerts on 44 potential allegations relating to environmental and human rights concerns in its supply chain. The number of alerts\n Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022 121\n\n\u2013 assessment of information and documentation collected\nduring the investigation, preparation of an investigation report which summarises the findings and proposes remedial actions necessary to reasonably respond to and prevent the recurrence of the conduct, if any;\n\u2013 closing the investigation and reporting;\n\u2013 monitoring of the implementation of remedial actions.\nSupplier Risk Mapping\nThe supplier risk mapping is based on the alerts and grievance mechanisms detailed above, as well as the inherent risk mapping described below. It covers primarily tier-one suppliers; nonetheless if an alert raised is linked to a sub-tier supplier, the Company will include it in its risk mapping and act on it as appropriate.\n\nEnd of 2021, the Company launched a project to digitise the way for the suppliers to provide substance in products information. The main objective is to improve traceability and transparency on substances in products from the supply chain related to regulatory requirements. It also aims at replacing the current process and allowing an automated way of sharing this information. The solution for supplier substance data collection project started in 2022, with a target for the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business of 290 suppliers\u2019 sites to be deployed in the digital solution by year-end. At the end of 2022 this target was achieved.\nResponsible Mineral Sourcing\nThe Company places great importance on the responsible sourcing of materials used in manufacturing. Some minerals including 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) are necessary for the proper functioning of components within its products. The Company largely does not directly import minerals, but these minerals are found in certain products the Company procures. In that context, the Company requires all suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations on conflict minerals, including any 3TG conflict minerals. In 2019, the Company released a Responsible Mineral Policy, which details its engagement to improve safety and human rights conditions in the mineral supply chains. As described in the section Work with External Stakeholders hereafter, the Company benefits from the Responsible Mineral Initiative (\u201cRMI\u201d) experience and available audits, tools and standardised ways of working.\nFor the small portion of direct procurement of parts containing minerals in the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division, a dedicated Conflict Mineral Management System has been established. For this small portion of direct import, the Defence and Space Division is proactively asking suppliers to disclose proof of responsible sourcing and is cross-checking this data with third parties\u2019 audits available through the RMI trade association. In 2022, the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division imported articles made of tungsten of the relevant Taric code above regulatory binding threshold; those articles are used as counterweight for aircraft. The Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division forecasted this import and performed relevant due diligence for the unique supplier supplying the material involved. The supplier was informed that the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division is expecting responsible sourcing for the tungsten purchased under this contract. The supplier demonstrated that this material was exclusively originating from responsible sources.\nThis claim of responsible sourcing is based on third party audits of the smelters involved to deliver the products. The Company reviewed this claim and recognised that the audits were part of the RMI scheme and that smelters involved in the supply chain of the tungsten concerned metals conformed to RMI standards.\nThe Company is also monitoring developments from the European Commission on critical raw materials (CRM) and is investigating the possibilities to take a deeper look at its related supply chain, through direct involvement and/or trade associations. The Supplier Code of Conduct formally requires suppliers to establish a policy and a management system to ensure that critical raw materials are sourced responsibly.\n3. Engagement and Awareness\nContractual Requirements\nThe Company\u2019s standard procurement contract templates have evolved over the last few years to reinforce clauses relating to sustainability and environment which require suppliers to:\n\u2013 comply with all applicable laws and regulations dealing with labour and employment, health and safety, environment, anti- corruption and bribery and personal data protection in relation to production, products and services;\n\u2013 provide information on substances used in manufacturing processes and contained in the product itself (covering both hazardous substances and conflict minerals);\n\u2013 provide information on environmental, health and safety matters such as safe usage and management of products across its lifecycle (including waste management);\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n\u2013 implement an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 or equivalent;\n\u2013 comply with the Company\u2019s anti-corruption and bribery requirements;\n\u2013 commit to apply and cascade in its supply chain the principles of the Company\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, including with regard to environment, human rights, labour practices, responsible sourcing of minerals and anti-corruption;\n\u2013 comply with the Company\u2019s sustainability requirements such as maturity assessment by an external expert company and completion of a questionnaire during the call-for-tender phase.\nThe Company\u2019s contractual requirements enable assessment of levels of suppliers\u2019 compliance.\nProcesses\nIn 2021, the SSCR Steering Committee agreed to anchor sustainability requirements into procurement processes of the Company. In 2022, the Company introduced sustainability in its supplier selection process. Sustainability is now one of the selection criteria in a call for tender. Suppliers are requested to fill in a sustainability questionnaire based on their governance and on the specific performance of the product or service the Company intends to source. The questionnaire notably requests information on certifications (e.g. environment, health and safety) and processes, as well as on resources used and on the impact of processes related to product manufacturing or service delivery.\nThis also includes the agreement from suppliers to regularly fulfil the evidence-based assessment on sustainability (see section Assessment above) and for the most important suppliers \u2013 based in part on annual spend with the Company \u2013 to be transparent on their climate change strategies (see section 5. \u201cCO2 emissions\u201d below). This will ultimately require suppliers to cooperate when a sustainability risk is identified, including with further analysis into the supplier\u2019s supply chain (see paragraph Contractual requirements above).\nSupplier Award and Dialogue\nThe Company is fostering suppliers\u2019 engagement through direct dialogue and values the commitment, contribution and efforts of its supply chain to improve on sustainability topics.\nIn 2022, the Company launched the first Airbus Supplier Sustainability Council establishing a framework to step-up collaboration within its supply chain on sustainability and fostering a new model of engagement with suppliers. The target is to launch concrete improvement initiatives co-led by representatives of the Company and of members of the council. The council will focus on areas such as decarbonisation, transparency and engagement acting as key enablers to accelerate specific initiatives from industry bodies such as IAEG and to share best practices across the full supply base.\nSustainability is a standard agenda item in regular reviews or conferences with suppliers, including the Annual Supplier Conference for the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business, the Defence and Space Division supplier conference or the Suppliers\u2019 councils. During these events, workshops take place to enable exchange on best practices and future collaboration.\nThe Company continues to give awards to its suppliers contributing positively to sustainability. In 2022, SABCA was awarded by the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business for its 5-year plan to cut CO2 emissions at its site by installing wind turbines, solar panels and optimising transportation of\n Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022 123\n\nDuring 2022, the Company has continued to implement its communication plan to raise awareness on the different pillars of its sustainability ambition amongst its employees, suppliers, and customers. In particular:\n\u2013 awareness sessions have been carried out in relation to the initiatives of the supply chain roadmap: for instance accompanying the deployment of the new sustainability questionnaire in calls for tender, or developing the ability of procurement operation teams to identify sustainability issues when visiting suppliers on-site;\n\u2013 communication activities in 2022 spread the key messages about the importance of sustainability. Internally, for instance, there was a presentation of the SSCR progress during the procurement annual roadshow, and a SSCR \u201cmarketplace\u201d during the annual sustainability town hall. Externally, the Company\u2019s CPO participated in the IAEG sponsor meeting about supplier assessment and development, as well as the Bundesverband f\u00fcr Materialwirtschaft, Einkaufe & Logistik (\u201cBME\u201d) conference in Berlin;\n\u2013 the toolkit presenting sustainability in the supply chain, deployed in 2021, targeting internal and external population, is regularly updated;\n\u2013 different additional communication means are being used such as: posters, kakemonos, a dedicated intranet website, participation in internal events promoting sustainability initiatives.\nGemba walk\nIn 2019, the Company introduced Supplier Factory Visits called \u201cthe Gemba Walk\u201d pocketbook, applicable to commercial aircraft activities, which is a practical and visual guide for the Company\u2019s employees when visiting the shop floor of a supplier, supporting the identification and reporting of risks or improvement opportunities observed during factory visits.\nWork With External Stakeholders\nThe Company is a founding member of IAEG, which is working on common aerospace industry standards and tools to manage environmental obligations. More specifically, for the supply chain, IAEG has developed:\n\u2013 a supply chain environmental survey, which the Company implemented in 2019 and which will be used as environmental assessment module, as mentioned in the section \u201cAssessment\u201d above;\n\u2013 an EMS implementation guideline to encourage a wider uptake of EMSs as appropriate for each supplier in a phased approach and cost effective, consistent and supportive manner;\n\u2013 the definition of an Environmental Qualification Program to assess and develop the environmental maturity of suppliers.\nUnder Company\u2019s leadership, the IAEG (initially focused on environment) extended its scope of actions to environmental, social and governance topics. In 2022, and co-led by the Company, a contract has been established between IAEG and the selected service provider to build a sectoral approach for supplier engagement and 2023 will be the year of deployment.\nAs a co-founder of the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (\u201cIFBEC\u201d), the Company is supporting the application of global standards for business ethics and compliance. IFBEC members have established a Model Supplier Code of Conduct which expresses the minimum ethical standards to be applied by suppliers throughout the aerospace and defence industries. It also encourages suppliers to go beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognised standards in order to advance in social and environmental responsibility and business ethics.\nAll suppliers are now being asked to sign a confirmation of compliance with the principles of the latest version of the Supplier Code of Conduct (or to confirm their own practices are aligned with the principles set out in this Code), and to cascade these principles throughout their own supply chains. The Company is committed to support suppliers, where necessary, to improve their own human rights due diligence.\nIn 2019, the Company joined the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s RMI, in order to further enforce activities of responsible sourcing while applying industry standards for supplier due diligence and data management in accordance with the OECD framework. In 2022, it decided to extend its membership to the whole Responsible Business Alliance (\u201cRBA\u201d) initiative.\nEU Taxonomy KPIs Accompanying Information\n1. Accounting Policy\nThe Company\u2019s EU Taxonomy disclosure covers the following scope: EU Taxonomy-compliant share of turnover, capital expenditure (\u201cCapEx\u201d) aligned with the EU Taxonomy and operational expenditure (\u201cOpEx\u201d) aligned with the EU Taxonomy of the Company consolidated that, for the purpose of EU Taxonomy disclosure, are split per economic activity according to the Climate Delegated Act and the Complementary Climate Delegated Act of the EU Taxonomy. Please refer to the \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 4: Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nIn the context of EU Taxonomy disclosure, the Company assessed any economic activity that in aggregate exceeds 1% of the total turnover, CapEx or OpEx. The materiality threshold has been set at 1%, as the Company expects economic activities that in aggregate do not exceed 1% of the total turnover, CapEx or OpEx to have no material influence on the reporting. However, should there be availability of data, the Company may choose to disclose such activities.\nTurnover, CapEx and OpEx were determined and allocated to the numerator by performing a mapping between the description of activities in the EU Taxonomy and the Company\u2019s portfolio of sources of revenues, investments and expenses.\nAs the EU Taxonomy KPIs are published for the first time in the reporting over FY 2022, prior-year figures are not provided. No material changes to the CapEx plan have occurred in FY 2022. The capital expenditures disclosed under the CapEx KPI are not part of a CapEx Plan meeting the conditions specified under the EU taxonomy regulation.\n2. Assessment of Compliance with EU Taxonomy Regulation\nInformation on Assessment of Compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe assessment of compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation has been carried out in four steps:\nIn light of the complexity and granularity of the applicable criteria, the investments could not be assessed as aligned by the Company in 2022. The Company took a cautious approach to assessing Appendix C criteria and compliance could not be confirmed in 2022.\nIn addition, some of the CapEx contributing to the Company\u2019s decarbonisation plan as presented in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.2 Climate Change\u201d could not be assessed as eligible.\nThe capital expenditures disclosed under the CapEx KPI are not part of a CapEx Plan meeting the conditions specified under the EU taxonomy Regulation.\n(1) Platform on Sustainable Finance \u2013 Final report on Minimum Safeguards, October 2022.\n 142 Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022\n  Contextual Information About the OpEx KPI\nThe Company\u2019s OpEx definition differs from the EU Taxonomy OpEx definition. For the purpose of the EU Taxonomy disclosure, only research and development costs are considered.\nFuture Developments\nIn the coming years, the Company will continue to report under the EU Taxonomy with regard to its Taxonomy-eligible economic activities as well as its Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. This entails a further and continuous review of our economic activities. Future guidance on the EU Taxonomy could result in updated definitions and other decision-making in meeting reporting obligations that may come into force. The Company expects that its reporting will evolve over time as more insights will be gained on how best to comply with the EU Taxonomy. If the delegated act related to the manufacturing of aircraft is adopted under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the turnover generated by sales of commercial aircraft may then become eligible.\nEstimated eligibility and alignment if aviation-related technical screening criteria were to be adopted as per draft recommendation: Pursuant to the Draft Recommendations, aviation-related activities are included in the EU Taxonomy by\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\nmeans of delegated act(s) to be adopted in 2023. The Company\u2019s commercial aircraft activity corresponding to NACE code 30.3 is described under section 7.2 Manufacturing of aircraft of the Draft Recommendations (1). According to the Draft Recommendations, a majority of the Company\u2019s 2022 turnover would be eligible, mainly including the turnover generated by sales of commercial aircraft. Based on the same information, the Company estimates that a significant portion of this eligible turnover could be Taxonomy-aligned, subject to Do-No-Significant-Harm criteria and minimum safeguards criteria assessment. As per the technical screening criteria of section 7.2 of the Draft Recommendations, the alignment would correspond to the proportion of new aircraft sold that will replace less efficient older generation aircraft, and therefore contributing to reducing the overall carbon footprint of aviation \u2013 as described in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.2 Climate change\u201d / IV. Transition plan / 2. Product stewardship. Activities from the Company\u2019s two Divisions may be covered to some extent in future developments of the EU Taxonomy, while current level of information available does not enable the Company to provide an estimate. Accordingly, \u201cbest-in-class\u201d aircraft programme related CapEx, and R&D (Operating Expenses) should be respectively eligible and aligned at least in proportions similar to turnover ones.\nThe table provides detailed information about the governance, policies, external standards, key metrics, and resources related to Business Integrity under different frameworks including GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board), SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), and others.

MBDA offers missile systems capabilities that cover the whole range of solutions for air dominance, ground-based air defence, maritime superiority and battlefield engagement. Beyond its role in European markets, MBDA has an established presence in export markets like Asia,\nThe broad product portfolio covers all five principal missile system categories: air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, anti-ship and surface-to-surface. MBDA\u2019s product range also includes a portfolio of airborne countermeasures such as missile warning and decoy systems and other customer support activities.\nThe most significant programmes currently under development are the next generation of the successful MICA air-to-air missile (Missile d'interception, de combat et d'autod\u00e9fense), the SPEAR 3 missile (Selected Precision Effects at Range Capability 3), the precision attack Brimstone 3 missile, the CAMM-ER missile (Common Anti-Air Modular Missile Extended Range), the Anglo-French joint initiative for a FC/ASW (Future Cruise / Anti- Ship Weapon), the development of Anti-ship weapons for the two nations, as well as the battlefield engagement MHT missile (Missile Haute Trame).\nRecent product upgrades also include the Aster Block 1 NT (New Technology), the air and missile defence systems for France and Italy, the Sea Venom / ANL (Anti-Navire L\u00e9ger) missile for the helicopters of the UK and French navies, as well as the Enforcer/ MMP (Missile Moyenne Port\u00e9e) missile for the battlefield.\nFurther activities include the preparation of hypersonic and direct energy applications/systems for future programmes such as FCAS and Tempest, the production of various aircraft packages for the Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale existing programmes (including ASRAAM, MICA NT, and Meteor BVRAAM), as well as the production of various packages for frigates and corvettes systems/missiles (including Aster B1, CAMM, VL MICA, Marte ER and Otomat).\nArianeGroup\nAirbus Defence and Space is active in the field of launchers and launch services through its ArianeGroup joint venture, which prior to July 2017 was named Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL).\nArianeGroup is responsible for the coordination and programme management of civil activities of the launcher business and relevant participations that have been transferred. ArianeGroup owns a total 74% stake in Arianespace, 46% of Starsem and 51% of Eurockot, providing a complete range of launch services with the Ariane, Vega and Rockot launchers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Insurance Risk Management function (\u201cIRM\u201d) is established to proactively and efficiently respond to risks that can be treated by insurance techniques. IRM is responsible for all corporate insurance activities and related protection for the Company and is empowered to deal directly with the insurance and re-insurance markets via the Company\u2019s inhouse broker entity. IRM\u2019s continuous objective in 2022 was to further implement and improve efficient and appropriate corporate and project-related insurance solutions.\nIRM\u2019s mission includes the definition and implementation of the Company\u2019s strategy for insurance risk management to help ensure that harmonised insurance policies and standards are in place for all insurable risks worldwide for the Company. A systematic review, monitoring and reporting procedure applicable to all Divisions is in place to assess the exposure and protection systems applicable to all the Company\u2019s sites. The Company\u2019s insurance programmes cover high risk exposures related to its assets and liabilities.\nAsset and liability insurance policies underwritten by IRM for the Company cover risks such as property damage, business interruption, cyber, aviation and non-aviation general and product liability. IRM also provides a Group insurance policy for Supervisory and Managing Board Members and certain\nother employees of the Company. The Company follows a policy of seeking to transfer the insurable risk of the Company to external insurance markets at reasonable conditions, on customised and sufficient terms and limits as provided by the international insurance markets. A difficult global corporate insurance environment remained in 2022 due to economical and geopolitical situations and the corporate insurers have maintained their underwriting strategy for large corporations, however, Airbus\u2019 positive outlook and insurance strategy allowed to differentiate the impact on insurance policies.\nAirbus is, with other European companies, one of the founding members of the cyber insurance mutual Miris dedicated to cyber risks. Miris will participate in the cyber group insurance policy in 2023.\nThe insurance industry and some risk factors impact on the Company\u2019s risk remain unpredictable and most Group insurance policies are renewed on an annual basis. There may be further demands to change scope of coverage, premiums and deductible amounts. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its current levels of coverage nor that the insurance policies in place are adequate to cover all significant risk exposure of the Company.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in various governmental, legal and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, the most significant of which are described below. Other than as described below, there are no material governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened) which may have or have had in the recent past significant effects on Airbus SE\u2019s or the Company\u2019s Financial Position or profitability.\nRegarding the Company\u2019s provisions policy, the Company recognises provisions for litigation and claims when (i) it has a present obligation from legal actions, governmental investigations, proceedings and other claims resulting from past events that are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against the Company, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle such obligation and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of such obligation can be made. Although the Company believes that adequate provisions have been made to cover current or contemplated general and specific litigation and regulatory risks, no assurance can be provided that such provisions will be sufficient. For the amount of provisions for litigation and claims, please refer to the \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 25: Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities\u201d.\nIf the Company concludes that the disclosures relative to contingent liabilities can be expected to prejudice seriously its position in a dispute with other parties, the Company limits its disclosures to the nature of the dispute.\nInvestigation by the UK SFO,\nFrance\u2019s PNF, US Departments of State and Justice and Related Commercial Litigation\nThe Company reached final agreements (\u201cthe agreements\u201d) with the French Parquet National Financier (\u201cPNF\u201d), the UK Serious Fraud Office (\u201cSFO\u201d), and the US Department of Justice (\u201cDoJ\u201d) resolving the authorities\u2019 investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption, as well as with the US Department of State (\u201cDoS\u201d) and the DoJ to resolve their investigations into inaccurate and misleading filings made with the DoS pursuant to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d). The agreements were approved and made public on 31 January 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company agreed to pay penalties of \u20ac3,597,766,766 plus interest and costs to the French, UK and US authorities. This was recognised in the Company\u2019s 2019 accounts. The settlements with each authority were as follows: PNF \u20ac2,083,137,455, the SFO \u20ac983,974,311, the DoJ \u20ac526,150,496 and the DoS \u20ac9,009,008 of which \u20ac4,504,504 May be used for approved remedial compliance measures. All penalties have been paid.\nUnder the terms of the Convention judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public (\u201cCJIP\u201d) with the PNF, the Company has an obligation to submit its compliance programme to targeted audits carried out by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise Anticorruption (\u201cAFA\u201d) over a period of three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the SFO, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on the Company in light of the continuing monitorship to be conducted by the AFA.\nUnder the terms of the DPA with the DoJ, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on Airbus under the agreement with the DoJ, but the Company will periodically report on its continuing compliance enhancement progress during the three year term of the DPA and carry out further reviews as required by the DoJ.\nThe agreements resulted in the suspension of prosecution for a duration of three years. This deferral period ended on 31 January 2023. The Company awaits the formal determination by the authorities that it has complied with the agreements\u2019 terms throughout the period whereupon it expects the closure of the prosecutions in line with the procedural requirements of each country. On 13 February 2023, the SFO gave notice to the Company discontinuing the prosecution. On 17 March 2023, the PNF gave notice of the same with receipt of the Constat de l'extinction de l'action publique.\nUnder the terms of the Consent Agreement with the DoS, the DoS has agreed to settle all civil violations of the ITAR outlined in the Company\u2019s voluntary disclosures identified in the Consent Agreement, and the Company has agreed to retain an independent export control compliance officer, who will monitor the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s export control systems and its compliance with the ITAR for a duration of three years.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s decision to redirect export control compliance resources to ensure compliance with export control restrictions and international sanctions announced against Russia, Belarus and certain Russian entities and individuals following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Company asked the DoS to extend the Consent Agreement by nine months. The DoS has granted the extension. The Company does not expect the Consent Agreement extension to have an impact on the DPAs with the SFO and DoJ, nor on the CJIP with the PNF, nor on the AFA\u2019s monitorship, as those are independent of the DoS\u2019s civil compliance programme review.\nAny breach of the terms of the agreements by the Company could lead to rescission by the authorities of the terms of the agreements and reopening of the prosecutions. Prosecution could result in the imposition of further monetary penalties or other sanctions including additional tax liability and could have a material impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nIn addition to any pending investigation in other jurisdictions, the factual disclosures made in the course of reaching the agreements may result in the commencement of additional investigations in other jurisdictions. Such investigations could also result in (i) civil claims or claims by shareholders against the Company, (ii) adverse consequences on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain or continue financing for current or future projects, (iii) limitations on the eligibility of group companies for certain public sector contracts, and/or (iv) damage to the Company\u2019s business or reputation via negative publicity adversely affecting the Company\u2019s prospects in the commercial market place.\nAirbus will continue to cooperate with the authorities in the future, pursuant to the agreements and to enhance its strong Ethics & Compliance culture within the Company.\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.1 Presentation of the Company\nSeveral consultants and other third parties have initiated commercial litigation and arbitration against the Company seeking relief. The agreements reached with authorities may lead to additional commercial litigation and arbitration against the Company and tax liability in the future, which could have a material impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn August 2020, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in US federal court in the state of New Jersey against Airbus SE and members of its current and former management. The Company was served with the complaint in the fourth quarter of 2021. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of alleged shareholders that purchased or otherwise acquired Airbus SE securities in the US between 24 February 2016 and 30 July 2020, and asserted violations of US securities laws. The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements or omissions concerning, among other things, the Company\u2019s agreements approved on 31 January 2020 with the French PNF, the UK SFO, the US DoJ and the US DoS as well as the Company\u2019s historic practices regarding the use of third party business partners and anti-corruption compliance. The matter was fully and finally settled on 30 September 2022 in exchange for a payment in the amount of $5,000,000 USD without any acknowledgement of liability.\nIn addition, the Company received notification in August 2021 of two separate claims and in March 2022 a third claim, all alleging similar facts as the US class action. Three claims have been filed in the Netherlands purportedly on behalf of Airbus investors.\nThe first Dutch claim was filed in August 2021 by a special purpose vehicle incorporated under the laws of Guernsey, an assignee purportedly representing numerous private shareholders and institutional investors, seeking a declaratory judgment with damages to be assessed in follow on proceedings. This claim is now pending before the Amsterdam District Court.\nThe second Dutch claim was filed in December 2021 following a demand letter sent by a foundation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, a purported representative of unnamed institutional and retail investors worldwide, starting a class action against the Company before the Dutch courts. This second Dutch claim targets the Company, certain of the Company\u2019s current and former directors and officers, and the Company\u2019s current and former auditors.\nThe third Dutch claim was a class action filed in April 2022 against the Company by a foundation incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. In accordance with Dutch procedural law, the two Dutch class action claims are treated jointly as one case.\nThe Dutch claims allege that the Company violated its reporting obligations by failing to adequately inform investors and providing false or misleading information about its use of intermediaries and alleged corrupt practices, its related financial exposure, internal investigations and subsequent measures taken by the Company, and related criminal investigations, which allegedly impacted the Company\u2019s share price.\nThe Company cannot exclude the possibility that additional claims are filed related to this subject matter attempting different theories of recovery in the same or different jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company believes it has solid grounds to defend itself against the allegations. The consequences of such litigation and the outcome of the proceedings cannot be fully assessed at this stage, but any judgment or decision unfavourable to the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company.\nAir France Flight 447 Trial\nOn 1 June 2009, an A330 operated by Air France flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean with 228 persons onboard. The wreckage was located in April 2011 after several search campaigns organised by the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses (\u201cBEA\u201d), which published its final investigation report in July 2012. In the wake of the accident, the prosecutor in Paris opened an investigation for involuntary manslaughter and Airbus SAS was charged in March 2011. In September 2019, the investigating magistrates closed the investigation and dismissed all criminal charges after a thorough analysis of the technical and legal elements of the case. However, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned the magistrates\u2019 decision and ordered trial for involuntary manslaughter. The Company\u2019s appeal to the French Supreme Court has been dismissed. The trial took place in the fourth quarter of 2022. The prosecutor recommended a dismissal of all criminal charges against Air France and Airbus. The judgment of the Paris Criminal Court expected on 17 April 2023, if unfavourable to the Company, could result in damage to its business or reputation.\nQatar Airways Commercial Litigation\nCiting surface degradation on some of its A350 fleet and alleging an underlying \u201cdesign defect\u201d, Qatar Airways filed a legal claim against the Company in the London Commercial Court on 17 December 2021. On 1 February 2023, the parties announced they had reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal dispute over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. The parties have proceeded to discontinue their legal claims. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability for either party. The parties have also agreed terms for the delivery of 50 A321 and 23 A350 aircraft.\nGrand Canyon Helicopter Accident\nOn 10 February 2018, a fatal accident occurred in the Grand Canyon at a site called Quartermaster in Arizona involving an EC130 B4 helicopter operated by Papillon Helicopters impacting the canyon floor and catching fire, leading to five fatalities and two severely injured persons. Following the accident, product liability claims were filed in Nevada state court in the US, including claims by the estate and parents of a deceased passenger and by the injured pilot of the helicopter. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims, but such claims may generate negative publicity and reputational harm. The trial is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2024. Any judgment or decision unfavourable to the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Financial Statements, business and operations of the Company as well as on its reputation.\nOther Investigations\nThe Company cooperated fully with the authorities in relation to three investigations initiated by independent magistrates in France concerning the activities of commercial intermediaries in Libya, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and several Eastern European countries. In recognition of the fulsome nature of the cooperation and upon payment of a penalty of \u20ac15.8 million, all three investigations were closed by means of a Convention judiciaire d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (\u201cCJIP\u201d) with the PNF on 30 November 2022. This ends all remaining prosecutions in France for similar historical activities.\nIn 2019, the Company self-reported to German authorities potentially improper advance receipt and communication of confidential customer information by employees of Airbus Defence and Space GmbH. The information concerned relates to future German government procurement projects. The self- disclosure by the Company followed an internal review with the support of an external law firm. Both the German Ministry of Defence and the Munich public prosecutor opened an investigation into the matter. The investigation could have an impact on Airbus Defence and Space GmbH\u2019s and Airbus Secure Land Communications GmbH\u2019s ability to participate in future public procurement projects in Germany. In 2021 the Munich prosecution issued a penalty notice against Airbus Defence and Space GmbH for \u20ac 10 million for negligent violation of supervisory duties in connection with this matter. The Company continues to fully cooperate with relevant authorities.\nConscious of the strategic importance of sustainability, the Company has defined governance at the highest level. Oversight has been established at the Board of Directors level with the Ethics, Compliance and Sustainability Committee (\u201cECSC\u201d). For further information about the ECSC, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.1 Management and Control\u201d.

The Executive Committee has the responsibility to provide top level expectations and direction, while overseeing and validating the sustainability strategy. This entails validating sustainability targets, including those integrated into the Top Company Objectives.\nThis graphic represents the organizational structure for governance related to ethics, compliance, and sustainability within a company.

Where relevant, additional elements of governance linked to specific topics are explained in the governance sections of this report.\nOrganisation and policy framework: The sustainability & environment team put in place in January 2020 at corporate level has continued to develop and expand. Its mission continues to focus on:\n- Setting the ambition level regarding the Company\u2019s environmental and social commitments;\n- Identifying the levers to achieve this ambition;\n- Enabling the business to deliver this ambition across the\nfull value chain;\n- Engaging employees on sustainability;\n- Providing clarity on ambition and progress to internal and external stakeholders;\n- Coordinating with relevant functions the performance and reporting on progress with regards to the four commitments.\nWhile the sustainability & environment team has a Company-wide role to provide direction and check regularly on advancements across all sustainability topics, there are for each of those topics (e.g. health and safety, inclusion and diversity, human rights, etc.), related functions, departments or \u201croadmaps\u201d (multi-functional teams addressing cross-functional sustainability topics) driving\ntheir continuous improvement. These teams are for the most part supported by dedicated policies which are referred to in the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct \u2013 a single reference intended to guide daily behaviour and help employees resolve the most common ethical and compliance issues that they may encounter. The Code of Conduct applies to all of the Company\u2019s employees and directors, regardless of their job title, responsibilities, seniority, or location, within every subsidiary or joint venture where the Company has control.\nIncentivisation and remuneration: The Company also believes the integration of sustainability criteria into its reward mechanisms is an important enabler for accelerating its sustainability ambition. A sustainability criterion is integrated into the common collective component of the CEO\u2019s variable remuneration, accounting for 20%, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.2.1 Remuneration Policy\u201d. This principle also applies to the other members of the Executive Committee who do not serve on the Board of Directors, and to a large extent to executives and \u201cLevel IV\u201d managers employed at the Company. Other criteria also apply to all employees as summarised below:\nVII. Airbus\u2019 Way Forward: Vigilance Plan\nThe Company is determined to conduct its business responsibly and with integrity. It is convinced that promoting responsible business conduct within its value chain is key to sustainable growth. The Company\u2019s vigilance plan includes measures to identify risks and prevent serious impacts related to sustainability resulting from the Company\u2019s own operations and from its suppliers and other contractors (including subcontractors). As far as its own operations are concerned, the Company has adopted internal policies and management tools to perform the monitoring, assessment, mitigation and reporting of risk and compliance allegations, which are embedded into the Company\u2019s culture and processes. For the Company\u2019s vigilance plan for its supply chain, see \u201c\u2013 1.2.15 Responsible Supply Chain\u201d, which shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference and form part of this plan.\nEnterprise risk management and internal audit:With regards to risk management, sustainability risks and opportunities are fully embedded in the Company\u2019s ERM system. For further information on ERM, see \u201c\u2013 Corporate Governance \u2013 4.1.3 Enterprise Risk Management System\u201d. For further information on the Company\u2019s risks, see \u201c\u2013 Risk Factors\u201d. Internal audits are also performed regularly across the Company, including on sustainability topics. External audits are performed in line with certification requirements, as detailed in the related material topic sections.\nSustainability competencies and employee engagement:\nRaising awareness, developing competencies and engaging employees are essential to preventing and mitigating sustainability risks and maximising opportunities. On this matter, the Company offered employees more than 900 online and in- person training opportunities in 2022, ranging from ethics and compliance to export control, health and safety, product safety, cyber security, internal controls, inclusion and diversity, quality and customer centricity, sustainability awareness and more. Training courses linked to sustainability topics were integrated into the 2022 mandatory training list for Company employees. Specific information on training is covered in the related material topic sections.\nAffiliates: All Company controlled affiliates are expected to deploy similar internal policies by applying the Company\u2019s directives. A company-wide single directive defines rules, processes and procedures applicable to the Company\u2019s affiliates and their respective boards, directors and officers. Its enforcement is supported by the Directors\u2019 training programme which was delivered to 117 people in 2022 over eight full-day digital sessions, as well as on-boarding sessions performed for newly appointed managing directors of controlled affiliates. The single directive assists the Company\u2019s affiliates in effectively fulfilling their responsibilities, while assuring the Company\u2019s ongoing commitment to high standards of corporate governance. It was built on the basis of Company related internal policies including, but not limited to: the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, International Framework Agreement, Agreement on the European Works Council, Supplier Code of Conduct, Health & Safety Policy, Environmental Policy, the Company\u2019s Anti-Corruption Policy and related directives. An online Internal Controls Self Assessment (\u201cICSA\u201d) is completed on an annual basis by the controlled affiliates to self-assess their internal controls, including how they relate to the environment, health and safety, human resources, governance, finance, procurement and compliance requirements in order to identify any gaps and define remedial action plans as required. Controlled affiliates can update the self-assessment on a quarterly basis based on their progression. Following ICSA, internal verifications are carried out by the respective corporate functions to validate answers and, when gaps are identified, develop improvement measures jointly with controlled affiliates to enhance their conformity level. In 2022, 81 controlled affiliates were selected to perform such verifications. Verifications are run every three years at least, and more frequently when ICSAs evidence material gaps. The Company\u2019s controlled affiliates are also asked to regularly evaluate risks via the Company\u2019s ERM system, and to regularly monitor them as part of their risk assessment process.\nThe Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance programme seeks to ensure that the Company\u2019s business practices conform to applicable laws, regulations and ethical business principles, as well as reinforcing a culture of integrity and speak-up. In 2022, Ethics & Compliance continued to be a top priority for the Company. In its list of priorities for the year, the Company set the objective to Speak Up, Listen Up and act with integrity and respect.\nThe Company has worked over the past several years to develop an Ethics & Compliance programme that is structured around the following key risk areas: Business Ethics / Anti-Corruption\nCompliance, Export Compliance and Privacy. Each of these areas is, in turn, supported by dedicated compliance policies and a team responsible for their implementation, together with the identification and proposal of new measures to adapt to a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.\nImproving the Ethics & Compliance programme remains a constant and ongoing process, in cooperation with other functions within the Company, in order to sustain and capitalise on its values.\nSDGs Others\n\nII. Governance\nThe Ethics & Compliance organisation is part of the Legal Department under the ultimate responsibility of the Company\u2019s General Counsel. The aim is to provide strong governance throughout the Company with the global presence of qualified Compliance officers who ensure the Ethics & Compliance programme is implemented consistently in the different functional and operational areas.\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, who reports to both the General Counsel and the ECSC of the Board of Directors, leads a dedicated team of Compliance professionals who are responsible for supporting and advising across the Company on compliance related topics, supporting the day-to- day business, performing risk assessments, drafting policies, conducting third party due diligence, investigating compliance\nallegations, implementing tools and controls and delivering compliance training.\nThe ECSC also plays a key role in the oversight and continued development of the Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of Ethics & Compliance.\nIn addition to the dedicated Compliance professionals, the Company is coordinating a network of part-time Ethics & Compliance Representatives (\u201cECRs\u201d), spanning all Divisions, functions, and regions. The number of ECRs slightly increased in 2022, with a total of 373 ECRs at the end of 2022 (compared to 340 at the end of 2021). Although the ECR network members are not compliance experts, they play an important role in promoting\nhe Ethics & Compliance programme and culture and serve as points of contact for any employee who has questions about the Ethics & Compliance programme or wishes to raise an Ethics & Compliance concern, including but not limited to bribery or corruption. The Ethics & Compliance team animates the ECR network, providing continuous training and information to the ECRs.\nIn February 2022, the Company launched the Export Control Points of Contact (\u201cEPoCs\u201d) network, spanning all Divisions, functions, and regions. Similar to ECRs, EPoCs are not export control experts but serve as \u201cfirst line of defence\u201d and the \u201cgo-to\u201d individuals for export control matters. On the occasion of the launch, the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer stated that \u201cby raising awareness among employees and acting as local focal points for queries on Export Control- related topics in their respective functions, EPoCs will be key contributors to the Company\u2019s common objective: embed an export control compliance system and culture throughout Company\u2019s businesses.\u201d By the end of 2022, the network was established and active within the business, with a total of 570 EPOCs.\nLikewise, the Personal Data Protection Officer (\u201cDPO\u201d) relies on a team of privacy experts to guide, train and advise the business with respect to privacy requirements, and a network of Privacy Focal Points in the business functions and affiliates, to support the Airbus privacy programme.\nIII. RiskManagement\nThe Company is required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world where it conducts business. This includes countries perceived as presenting an increased risk of corruption.\nAccordingly, the Company conducts a thorough bribery and corruption risk assessment across its two Divisions and different businesses annually. The results of this risk assessment are embedded and monitored within the Company\u2019s ERM framework and highlight, among others, the risk of improper payments being made to or via third parties such as sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors, suppliers, distributors and joint venture or offset partners. Further corruption risks include the use of sponsorships, donations, or political contributions to improperly benefit decision-makers, or the provision of excessive or overly frequent gifts and hospitality by Company employees.\nIn order to ensure its compliance with Export Control regulations and laws in the European Union, US and internationally, the Company continues to strengthen its Export Control compliance programme to ensure it is fit for purpose. Where risks are identified, they are embedded and monitored in the Company\u2019s ERM. Identified risks include potential unauthorised access to export-controlled data and hardware by third parties and non-compliance with the ITAR.\nRegarding privacy, the Company undertakes privacy impact assessments depending on the nature of the personal data processed or scale of the processing. In addition, risks relating to the protection of personal data are also assessed in the context of the ERM and kept updated.\nSpecific directives have been adopted to address the Company\u2019s key compliance risk areas. These include among others:\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance organisation is charged with oversight and monitoring of these directives to ensure that they are being implemented effectively. Periodic controls on key processes are performed and reports provided to the Company\u2019s Executive Committee and the ECSC, including recommendations to strengthen the Ethics & Compliance programme where necessary.\nIn addition, the Corporate Audit & Forensic Department conducts periodic, independent audits of the Company\u2019s compliance processes to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures and allow the Company to develop action plans for strengthening such controls.\nIV. Implementation/Activities\nAwareness and Training\nAs part of their annual goals & objectives, all Company employees are required to undergo a minimum amount of compliance training via e-learning. Additionally, depending on the function, the country and the level of risk implied by their role, certain employees are selected to attend live classroom training as well, including on Anti Bribery & Corruption and Export Control. Attendance in such cases is mandatory, and managers have a responsibility to ensure that their team members do so. Exposed employees are also required to complete regular training refreshers.\nFrom 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, the Company\u2019s employees followed 290,178 Ethics & Compliance e-learning sessions, including on bribery, corruption and export control. Furthermore, 4,699 employees attended live classroom training\nn different Ethics & Compliance topics over the period, the majority of which were delivered in virtual classroom settings due to the pandemic.\nLikewise, the Company also delivered anti-bribery and corruption training towards higher risk third parties, including sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors. In 2022, 100% of higher risk third parties were trained on Ethics & Compliance requirements and expectations.\nThe Company continued the roll out of the privacy e-learning as part of the Ethics & Compliance compulsory training catalogue. 3,181 privacy training sessions were performed in 2022 (reporting period from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022).\nSpeak-Up Channel: OpenLine\nThe Company recognises that the Code of Conduct cannot address every challenging situations that may arise, and therefore encourages its employees to speak-up through various channels, including through OpenLine (available at https://www. airbusopenline.com). The OpenLine enables users to submit an alert securely and confidentially, and also to ask questions related to Ethics & Compliance.\nThe Company protects those who speak up and raise concerns appropriately and in good faith. The Company does not retaliate against anyone who raises a concern, or against those who assist in investigations of suspected violations.\n847 investigative requests received in 2022\n524\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\nIn addition, the dataprotection@airbus.com mailbox is systematically published in the Company\u2019s privacy policies and information notices specific to the various applications, to ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights and/or lodge complaints.\nTo further increase awareness about Speak-Up, in 2022, the Ethics & Compliance team conducted an analysis of the results from the Company\u2019s internal survey \u201cMy Working Environment\u201d to identify opportunities to continuously foster a Speak Up culture. This analysis led to the launch of additional initiatives throughout the Company to promote Speak-Up culture, including the development of a Speak-Up team talk in January 2022, which was shared with all managers to help them raise the importance of speaking-up with their teams. A simplified version of this \u201cteam talk\u201d was designed and deployed within the shop floor community.\nIn 2022, the Company received a total of 847 investigative requests of which 524 were HR related. Cases requiring investigation are managed by dedicated members of the Ethics & Compliance team in accordance with an internal method for the conduct of Investigations. The Ethics & Compliance team provides regular updates to the pool of internal investigators, on internal policies, recent developments in the regulatory framework, and recurring reminders on investigation best practices to ensure the consistent deployment of compliance investigations across the entire Company.\nIn some instances, the Company may engage outside counsel for support, depending on the nature of the investigation.\nThe Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee and other relevant stakeholders (including relevant authorities, if applicable, and Company\u2019s local management teams) are briefed regarding the progress and outcome of internal investigations on a regular basis.\nPolicies and Procedures\nIn 2022, the Company continued to improve its policies and procedures framework, by issuing a guidance on third parties categorisation, for example, and translating the Code of Conduct into seven additional languages to maximise the reach of this foundational document. All policies and guidelines are made available to employees on the Intranet, and classroom training\nis delivered to employees who are particularly exposed to the underlying risks as described above.\nOn the Export Control side, the Company has cascaded its Export Control requirements through nine Directives and Methods throughout the Company. The cascading triggered an update of the relevant business processes and was completed in Summer 2022.\nIn 2021 and 2022, as required under the Consent Agreement, two audits of the Company\u2019s ITAR compliance programme were undertaken by external counsels. Please refer to \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 39: Litigation and Claims\u201d (Investigation by the SFO, PNF, DoJ, DoS, Related Commercial Litigation).\nResponsible Lobbying Charter\nThe Company is committed to ensuring that any lobbying activity is undertaken in compliance with all applicable laws and its anti-corruption programme. In 2021, the Company launched a Responsible Lobbying Charter aimed at anybody who engages with public officials in any capacity, including third party representatives retained by the Company. The Charter outlines the Company\u2019s core principles for responsible lobbying and brings together the Company\u2019s key codes and directives relevant to this topic. The principles are also reinforced by a training module available to all employees.\n1.2.15 Responsible Supply Chain\nI. Introduction\nV. Outlook\nAn effective Ethics & Compliance programme is one that, by definition, continuously adapts to changes and improves over time. Going forward, the Company will continue to assess its risks and monitor and test the implementation of mitigation measures at all levels: corporate level, Divisions, regions and local entities.\nWhen misconduct reveals a gap in compliance policies, procedures or tools, the Company undertakes revisions to its Ethics & Compliance programme commensurate with the wrongdoing and in light of lessons learned. While compliance at the Company will therefore always be a work in progress, the Company is committed to this endeavour, as it aims to make its Ethics & Compliance programme sustainable over time.\nWhile the Company\u2019s products and services are sold all over the world, the majority of its supply chain is based in Europe and OECD countries. However, in the past few years, the supply chain has become concentrated and more international. In addition, and due to increasing consolidation within the aerospace and defence sector, larger work packages are being placed with a smaller number of lead suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s global sourcing footprint is represented as follows based on Tier one suppliers only.\nTo promote further globalisation of its sourcing footprint, the Company has established regional procurement offices in North America (Herndon, VA), India (Bangalore), Asia Pacific (Singapore) and China (Beijing). The regional procurement offices represent the Procurement function in the respective regions. They are responsible for strategic sourcing, general procurement and supplier development (procurement operations) while supporting the application of the Company\u2019s procurement process and policy and digital solutions. As the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business and its two Divisions are certified ISO 14001, the Procurement function acts in adherence with ISO 14001 requirements.\nII. Governance\nThe Company\u2019s sustainable supply chain ambition is built on four pillars: \u201clead the journey towards clean aerospace, respect human rights and foster inclusion, build our business on the foundation of safety and quality, exemplify business integrity\u201d.\nDerived from this ambition, the Company\u2019s Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap is based on a three-step approach; supplier\ncommitment, supplier assessment, supplier engagement & development.\nThe Company strives to make environmental and social responsibility a core element of its procurement strategy. This includes managing the relationships with suppliers throughout the sourcing strategy, supplier selection, contract management and supplier monitoring and development. The Company\u2019s suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, all business shall be conducted by suppliers in compliance with the principles of the Company\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, which is the document of reference for the Company\u2019s responsible supplier management. This Supplier Code of Conduct integrates the group-wide values and principles in line with internationally recognised standards and conventions (such as OECD and ILO).\nIn order to drive the Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap (\u201cSSCR\u201d), a monthly Steering Committee chaired by the Head of Sustainability & Environment, and the Head of Procurement Governance & Strategy and the representative of the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company is implemented. The Steering Committee includes Chief Procurement Officers of Airbus Helicopters and of Airbus Defence and Space, as well as the Head of Health & Safety, the Head of Product Safety and the Head of Ethics & Compliance, or their nominated representatives. The EVP Communication and Corporate Affairs and the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company act as sponsors of the SSCR. In addition, the Head of Procurement Governance and Strategy is part of the Procurement Leadership Team and is responsible for facilitating the communication on sustainability activities between the SSCR and the Procurement Leadership Team on a regular basis.\nIn 2022 the SSCR Steering Committee validated the annual planning and quarterly reviewed the progress of its SSCR implementation notably regarding the assessment of suppliers\u2019 sustainability practices as well as the reinforcement of the engagement with suppliers. On top of those forums, the Chief Procurement Officer of the Company also reports to the ECSC on the progress of the Company\u2019s responsible sourcing strategy implementation.\nConcrete sustainability targets have been included in the 2022 objectives of the Company\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer (\u201cCPO\u201d) and are directly linked to the CPO\u2019s variable pay and cascaded through the Company\u2019s Procurement organisations:\n\u2013 commitment by suppliers to Airbus Supplier Code of Conduct for 85% of the 2021 sourcing volume;\n\u2013 supplier sustainability assessments completed for 50% of the 2021 sourcing volume;\n\u2013 response of suppliers to CDP assessment for 75% of the 2021 sourcing volume.\nAll sustainability activities in the supply chain are based on the following key elements and principles of due diligence following the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct:\n\u2013 supply base risk mapping;\n\u2013 supplier engagement and contractual requirements; \u2013 supplier assessment/audits and development plans; \u2013 policies, tools and reporting.\nFor any anti-corruption topics in the supply chain, the Procurement function cooperates closely with the Legal & Compliance department. The Company has also engaged into a plan to further develop its due diligence mechanisms (see IV. Due Diligence in the supply chain).\nThose priorities are consistent with the most material topics identified in the Company\u2019s supply chain.\nIII. RiskManagement\nThe Company\u2019s procurement-related risks and opportunities are embedded into the Company\u2019s ERM process. Risks and opportunities related to the deployment of the sustainability roadmap in the supply chain are managed according to the Procurement ERM plan and detailed hereafter.\n1. Impact on the Company\u2019s Reputation\nAny industrial accident or other serious incident in the supply chain, or any problems of the supplier to fulfil its operational or product compliance may have a significant adverse effect on the reputation of the Company and its products and services. The Company\u2019s reputation may also be affected by the public perception of social and/or environmental impacts of its supply chain\u2019s industrial operations on local environments, communities, biodiversity and the general public\u2019s health.\n2. Impact on the Local Environment\nFrom the extraction of raw materials to the manufacturing of parts delivered to the Company, a supplier\u2019s industrial operations may have significant adverse environmental impacts on the local environment where the activity is performed, with possible impacts on air, water, soil, biodiversity, workers\u2019 occupational health and safety, on the health of the general public, on the land rights of the local or indigenous communities and on forced and child labour (see salient risks in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.10 Human Rights\u201d).\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n3. Business Disruption Risk\nIn the event of a supplier failing to comply with environmental, human/labour rights, health and safety laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the levying of civil or criminal penalties and fines against the supplier. Regulatory authorities may require them to conduct investigations and undertake remedial activities, curtail operations or close installations or facilities temporarily to prevent imminent risks.\n4. Risk of Product Non-Compliance\nThe various products manufactured and sold by suppliers must comply with applicable environmental, human/labour rights, health and safety laws and regulations, for example those covering substances and product composition. Even if a supplier seeks to ensure that its products meet the highest quality standards, increasingly stringent and complex laws and regulations, new scientific discoveries, delivery of defective products or the obligation to notify or provide regulatory authorities or others with required information (such as under the REACH regulation) may force it to adapt, redesign, redevelop, recertify and/or remove its products from the market. Seizures of defective products may be pronounced and could prevent delivery to the Company. In response, a Procurement Task Force has been established to ensure group-wide governance for supplier management and assessment of chemical regulations and obsolescence impact. This task force also coordinates communication to suppliers on substance issues and on substitution solutions qualified by the Company.\nIn this frame, the Company provided to its supply chain a dedicated Tool Kit on \u201cREACH Substances \u2013 Certain Requirements & Substitution programmes\u201d. This tool kit reminds the main principles of the REACH regulation as Authorisation, Restrictions and Substitutions programmes in order to raise the attention of the supply chain on these challenges.\nIn response to the above 1. to 4., the Company deploys responsible sourcing activities and specific supplier due diligence actions in the frame of the SSCR.\nIV. SupplyChainVigilancePlan\n1. Due Diligence in the Supply Chain\nIn 2022 the Company launched a project aimed at reinforcing due diligence in its supply chain. The outcomes of the project will be rolled out in 2023. Activities under this project cover primarily the Company\u2019s own suppliers; nonetheless, if an alert raised is linked to an upstream supplier, the Company will act on it as appropriate.\nAlert and Grievance Mechanism\nFrom 2019, the Company\u2019s OpenLine has been accessible to external stakeholders, such as suppliers and their employees. For further information on OpenLine, see \u201c\u2013 1.2.14 Business Integrity\u201d. Access to OpenLine has been reiterated in the revised Supplier Code of Conduct.\nIn addition to OpenLine, the Company\u2019s sustainable supply chain team may receive alerts from other sources including through the supplier onboarding process, media or directly from employees. During 2022, the sustainable supply chain roadmap received alerts on 44 potential allegations relating to environmental and human rights concerns in its supply chain. The number of alerts\n Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022 121\n\n\u2013 assessment of information and documentation collected\nduring the investigation, preparation of an investigation report which summarises the findings and proposes remedial actions necessary to reasonably respond to and prevent the recurrence of the conduct, if any;\n\u2013 closing the investigation and reporting;\n\u2013 monitoring of the implementation of remedial actions.\nSupplier Risk Mapping\nThe supplier risk mapping is based on the alerts and grievance mechanisms detailed above, as well as the inherent risk mapping described below. It covers primarily tier-one suppliers; nonetheless if an alert raised is linked to a sub-tier supplier, the Company will include it in its risk mapping and act on it as appropriate.\n\nEnd of 2021, the Company launched a project to digitise the way for the suppliers to provide substance in products information. The main objective is to improve traceability and transparency on substances in products from the supply chain related to regulatory requirements. It also aims at replacing the current process and allowing an automated way of sharing this information. The solution for supplier substance data collection project started in 2022, with a target for the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business of 290 suppliers\u2019 sites to be deployed in the digital solution by year-end. At the end of 2022 this target was achieved.\nResponsible Mineral Sourcing\nThe Company places great importance on the responsible sourcing of materials used in manufacturing. Some minerals including 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) are necessary for the proper functioning of components within its products. The Company largely does not directly import minerals, but these minerals are found in certain products the Company procures. In that context, the Company requires all suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations on conflict minerals, including any 3TG conflict minerals. In 2019, the Company released a Responsible Mineral Policy, which details its engagement to improve safety and human rights conditions in the mineral supply chains. As described in the section Work with External Stakeholders hereafter, the Company benefits from the Responsible Mineral Initiative (\u201cRMI\u201d) experience and available audits, tools and standardised ways of working.\nFor the small portion of direct procurement of parts containing minerals in the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division, a dedicated Conflict Mineral Management System has been established. For this small portion of direct import, the Defence and Space Division is proactively asking suppliers to disclose proof of responsible sourcing and is cross-checking this data with third parties\u2019 audits available through the RMI trade association. In 2022, the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division imported articles made of tungsten of the relevant Taric code above regulatory binding threshold; those articles are used as counterweight for aircraft. The Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division forecasted this import and performed relevant due diligence for the unique supplier supplying the material involved. The supplier was informed that the Company\u2019s Defence and Space Division is expecting responsible sourcing for the tungsten purchased under this contract. The supplier demonstrated that this material was exclusively originating from responsible sources.\nThis claim of responsible sourcing is based on third party audits of the smelters involved to deliver the products. The Company reviewed this claim and recognised that the audits were part of the RMI scheme and that smelters involved in the supply chain of the tungsten concerned metals conformed to RMI standards.\nThe Company is also monitoring developments from the European Commission on critical raw materials (CRM) and is investigating the possibilities to take a deeper look at its related supply chain, through direct involvement and/or trade associations. The Supplier Code of Conduct formally requires suppliers to establish a policy and a management system to ensure that critical raw materials are sourced responsibly.\n3. Engagement and Awareness\nContractual Requirements\nThe Company\u2019s standard procurement contract templates have evolved over the last few years to reinforce clauses relating to sustainability and environment which require suppliers to:\n\u2013 comply with all applicable laws and regulations dealing with labour and employment, health and safety, environment, anti- corruption and bribery and personal data protection in relation to production, products and services;\n\u2013 provide information on substances used in manufacturing processes and contained in the product itself (covering both hazardous substances and conflict minerals);\n\u2013 provide information on environmental, health and safety matters such as safe usage and management of products across its lifecycle (including waste management);\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\n\u2013 implement an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 or equivalent;\n\u2013 comply with the Company\u2019s anti-corruption and bribery requirements;\n\u2013 commit to apply and cascade in its supply chain the principles of the Company\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, including with regard to environment, human rights, labour practices, responsible sourcing of minerals and anti-corruption;\n\u2013 comply with the Company\u2019s sustainability requirements such as maturity assessment by an external expert company and completion of a questionnaire during the call-for-tender phase.\nThe Company\u2019s contractual requirements enable assessment of levels of suppliers\u2019 compliance.\nProcesses\nIn 2021, the SSCR Steering Committee agreed to anchor sustainability requirements into procurement processes of the Company. In 2022, the Company introduced sustainability in its supplier selection process. Sustainability is now one of the selection criteria in a call for tender. Suppliers are requested to fill in a sustainability questionnaire based on their governance and on the specific performance of the product or service the Company intends to source. The questionnaire notably requests information on certifications (e.g. environment, health and safety) and processes, as well as on resources used and on the impact of processes related to product manufacturing or service delivery.\nThis also includes the agreement from suppliers to regularly fulfil the evidence-based assessment on sustainability (see section Assessment above) and for the most important suppliers \u2013 based in part on annual spend with the Company \u2013 to be transparent on their climate change strategies (see section 5. \u201cCO2 emissions\u201d below). This will ultimately require suppliers to cooperate when a sustainability risk is identified, including with further analysis into the supplier\u2019s supply chain (see paragraph Contractual requirements above).\nSupplier Award and Dialogue\nThe Company is fostering suppliers\u2019 engagement through direct dialogue and values the commitment, contribution and efforts of its supply chain to improve on sustainability topics.\nIn 2022, the Company launched the first Airbus Supplier Sustainability Council establishing a framework to step-up collaboration within its supply chain on sustainability and fostering a new model of engagement with suppliers. The target is to launch concrete improvement initiatives co-led by representatives of the Company and of members of the council. The council will focus on areas such as decarbonisation, transparency and engagement acting as key enablers to accelerate specific initiatives from industry bodies such as IAEG and to share best practices across the full supply base.\nSustainability is a standard agenda item in regular reviews or conferences with suppliers, including the Annual Supplier Conference for the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business, the Defence and Space Division supplier conference or the Suppliers\u2019 councils. During these events, workshops take place to enable exchange on best practices and future collaboration.\nThe Company continues to give awards to its suppliers contributing positively to sustainability. In 2022, SABCA was awarded by the Company\u2019s commercial aircraft business for its 5-year plan to cut CO2 emissions at its site by installing wind turbines, solar panels and optimising transportation of\n Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022 123\n\nDuring 2022, the Company has continued to implement its communication plan to raise awareness on the different pillars of its sustainability ambition amongst its employees, suppliers, and customers. In particular:\n\u2013 awareness sessions have been carried out in relation to the initiatives of the supply chain roadmap: for instance accompanying the deployment of the new sustainability questionnaire in calls for tender, or developing the ability of procurement operation teams to identify sustainability issues when visiting suppliers on-site;\n\u2013 communication activities in 2022 spread the key messages about the importance of sustainability. Internally, for instance, there was a presentation of the SSCR progress during the procurement annual roadshow, and a SSCR \u201cmarketplace\u201d during the annual sustainability town hall. Externally, the Company\u2019s CPO participated in the IAEG sponsor meeting about supplier assessment and development, as well as the Bundesverband f\u00fcr Materialwirtschaft, Einkaufe & Logistik (\u201cBME\u201d) conference in Berlin;\n\u2013 the toolkit presenting sustainability in the supply chain, deployed in 2021, targeting internal and external population, is regularly updated;\n\u2013 different additional communication means are being used such as: posters, kakemonos, a dedicated intranet website, participation in internal events promoting sustainability initiatives.\nGemba walk\nIn 2019, the Company introduced Supplier Factory Visits called \u201cthe Gemba Walk\u201d pocketbook, applicable to commercial aircraft activities, which is a practical and visual guide for the Company\u2019s employees when visiting the shop floor of a supplier, supporting the identification and reporting of risks or improvement opportunities observed during factory visits.\nWork With External Stakeholders\nThe Company is a founding member of IAEG, which is working on common aerospace industry standards and tools to manage environmental obligations. More specifically, for the supply chain, IAEG has developed:\n\u2013 a supply chain environmental survey, which the Company implemented in 2019 and which will be used as environmental assessment module, as mentioned in the section \u201cAssessment\u201d above;\n\u2013 an EMS implementation guideline to encourage a wider uptake of EMSs as appropriate for each supplier in a phased approach and cost effective, consistent and supportive manner;\n\u2013 the definition of an Environmental Qualification Program to assess and develop the environmental maturity of suppliers.\nUnder Company\u2019s leadership, the IAEG (initially focused on environment) extended its scope of actions to environmental, social and governance topics. In 2022, and co-led by the Company, a contract has been established between IAEG and the selected service provider to build a sectoral approach for supplier engagement and 2023 will be the year of deployment.\nAs a co-founder of the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (\u201cIFBEC\u201d), the Company is supporting the application of global standards for business ethics and compliance. IFBEC members have established a Model Supplier Code of Conduct which expresses the minimum ethical standards to be applied by suppliers throughout the aerospace and defence industries. It also encourages suppliers to go beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognised standards in order to advance in social and environmental responsibility and business ethics.\nAll suppliers are now being asked to sign a confirmation of compliance with the principles of the latest version of the Supplier Code of Conduct (or to confirm their own practices are aligned with the principles set out in this Code), and to cascade these principles throughout their own supply chains. The Company is committed to support suppliers, where necessary, to improve their own human rights due diligence.\nIn 2019, the Company joined the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s RMI, in order to further enforce activities of responsible sourcing while applying industry standards for supplier due diligence and data management in accordance with the OECD framework. In 2022, it decided to extend its membership to the whole Responsible Business Alliance (\u201cRBA\u201d) initiative.\nEU Taxonomy KPIs Accompanying Information\n1. Accounting Policy\nThe Company\u2019s EU Taxonomy disclosure covers the following scope: EU Taxonomy-compliant share of turnover, capital expenditure (\u201cCapEx\u201d) aligned with the EU Taxonomy and operational expenditure (\u201cOpEx\u201d) aligned with the EU Taxonomy of the Company consolidated that, for the purpose of EU Taxonomy disclosure, are split per economic activity according to the Climate Delegated Act and the Complementary Climate Delegated Act of the EU Taxonomy. Please refer to the \u201cNotes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements \u2013 Note 4: Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\nIn the context of EU Taxonomy disclosure, the Company assessed any economic activity that in aggregate exceeds 1% of the total turnover, CapEx or OpEx. The materiality threshold has been set at 1%, as the Company expects economic activities that in aggregate do not exceed 1% of the total turnover, CapEx or OpEx to have no material influence on the reporting. However, should there be availability of data, the Company may choose to disclose such activities.\nTurnover, CapEx and OpEx were determined and allocated to the numerator by performing a mapping between the description of activities in the EU Taxonomy and the Company\u2019s portfolio of sources of revenues, investments and expenses.\nAs the EU Taxonomy KPIs are published for the first time in the reporting over FY 2022, prior-year figures are not provided. No material changes to the CapEx plan have occurred in FY 2022. The capital expenditures disclosed under the CapEx KPI are not part of a CapEx Plan meeting the conditions specified under the EU taxonomy regulation.\n2. Assessment of Compliance with EU Taxonomy Regulation\nInformation on Assessment of Compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nThe assessment of compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation has been carried out in four steps:\nIn light of the complexity and granularity of the applicable criteria, the investments could not be assessed as aligned by the Company in 2022. The Company took a cautious approach to assessing Appendix C criteria and compliance could not be confirmed in 2022.\nIn addition, some of the CapEx contributing to the Company\u2019s decarbonisation plan as presented in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.2 Climate Change\u201d could not be assessed as eligible.\nThe capital expenditures disclosed under the CapEx KPI are not part of a CapEx Plan meeting the conditions specified under the EU taxonomy Regulation.\n(1) Platform on Sustainable Finance \u2013 Final report on Minimum Safeguards, October 2022.\n 142 Airbus / Annual Report \u2013 Universal Registration Document 2022\n  Contextual Information About the OpEx KPI\nThe Company\u2019s OpEx definition differs from the EU Taxonomy OpEx definition. For the purpose of the EU Taxonomy disclosure, only research and development costs are considered.\nFuture Developments\nIn the coming years, the Company will continue to report under the EU Taxonomy with regard to its Taxonomy-eligible economic activities as well as its Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. This entails a further and continuous review of our economic activities. Future guidance on the EU Taxonomy could result in updated definitions and other decision-making in meeting reporting obligations that may come into force. The Company expects that its reporting will evolve over time as more insights will be gained on how best to comply with the EU Taxonomy. If the delegated act related to the manufacturing of aircraft is adopted under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the turnover generated by sales of commercial aircraft may then become eligible.\nEstimated eligibility and alignment if aviation-related technical screening criteria were to be adopted as per draft recommendation: Pursuant to the Draft Recommendations, aviation-related activities are included in the EU Taxonomy by\n1. Information on the Company\u2019s Activities /\n1.2 Non-Financial Information\nmeans of delegated act(s) to be adopted in 2023. The Company\u2019s commercial aircraft activity corresponding to NACE code 30.3 is described under section 7.2 Manufacturing of aircraft of the Draft Recommendations (1). According to the Draft Recommendations, a majority of the Company\u2019s 2022 turnover would be eligible, mainly including the turnover generated by sales of commercial aircraft. Based on the same information, the Company estimates that a significant portion of this eligible turnover could be Taxonomy-aligned, subject to Do-No-Significant-Harm criteria and minimum safeguards criteria assessment. As per the technical screening criteria of section 7.2 of the Draft Recommendations, the alignment would correspond to the proportion of new aircraft sold that will replace less efficient older generation aircraft, and therefore contributing to reducing the overall carbon footprint of aviation \u2013 as described in section \u201c\u2013 1.2.2 Climate change\u201d / IV. Transition plan / 2. Product stewardship. Activities from the Company\u2019s two Divisions may be covered to some extent in future developments of the EU Taxonomy, while current level of information available does not enable the Company to provide an estimate. Accordingly, \u201cbest-in-class\u201d aircraft programme related CapEx, and R&D (Operating Expenses) should be respectively eligible and aligned at least in proportions similar to turnover ones.\nThe table provides detailed information about the governance, policies, external standards, key metrics, and resources related to Business Integrity under different frameworks including GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board), SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), and others.

Global Compact.\n> For further information about our commitment to human rights, see section 05.5.\nRead the Allianz Group Code of Conduct.\nZero tolerance of fraud\nand corruption\nOur target is zero fraud and corruption across our business and our principle is zero tolerance towards fraud\nand corruption.\nWe consider fraud and corruption as serious o#ences. The aforementioned principle is of absolute and primary importance. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits\nfrom the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery, and corruption.\nThis principle expresses Allianz\u2019s stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt o#er, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited\nfrom directly or indirectly o#ering, requesting, accepting, providing,\npaying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving \u2018Anything of Value\u2019 (defined broadly to include anything \u2013 monetary or non-monetary \u2013 that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any Public O$cial or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\nAnti-money laundering\nWe follow international standards and applicable laws related to money laundering and terrorism financing.\nAllianz regularly assesses the obligations of all operating entities under applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Each entity in the Group is required to determine and document whether any of their legal entities and/or branches is an AML-Obliged Entity (i.e., an entity subject to local AML law) under applicable\nlocal law.\nEach relevant entity must define a reasonable AML Program Framework that describes the AML Program, documents and describes the processes, procedures and controls that constitute\n05 Our universal principles\nthe AML-Obliged Entity\u2019s methods to execute the Internal Safeguards as outlined in the Allianz Standard for the Prevention of Financial Crime and Functional Rule.\nAt a minimum the AML Framework Program usually include rules regarding:\n\u2022 Scope of application of AML law\"\n\u2022 The AML risk assessment\"\n\u2022 Customer due diligence and transaction monitoring\"\n\u2022 Reporting requirements for suspicious activity\"\n\u2022 Communication, training and awareness\"\n\u2022 Record retention and protection of personal data\"\n\u2022 Reliability screening of employees\"\n\u2022\n\u2022 Ensuring appropriate measures to prevent the abuse of new products and technologies\"\n\u2022 Information sharing (group-wide if applicable)\"\n\nRespecting economic sanctions and embargoes\nAllianz is strongly committed to conducting business in full compliance and accordance with all applicable Economic Sanctions.\nThis means taking all reasonable steps to identify and mitigate the sanctions risks relevant in the business, including risks arising under local law as well as under foreign law (such as in certain cross-border transactions or in cases where extra- territorial sanctions laws are relevant due to links to that foreign jurisdiction or for other reasons).\nAny ambiguity regarding economic sanctions risk or the applicability of sanctions laws should be addressed with regard to the intention of the relevant sanctions regime.\nAllianz identifies and addresses financial sanctions risks by using financial sanctions screening tools. All operating entities must, at a minimum, use the sanctions lists issued by the European Union, United Nations, the US O\"ce of Foreign Assets Control, the US Bureau\nof International Security and Non- Proliferation, the US Department of State, the US Treasury and the United Kingdom\u2019s HM Treasury, in addition to all other locally and regionally applicable lists.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\n127\n02 Measuring and 03 Climate change managing sustainability related disclosure\n04 Strengthening our foundation\nrules that employees must observe when dealing with competitors, customers and business partners.\nAs in previous years, we provided regular classroom and online training in 2022\nto top management and exposed employees to refresh and develop their understanding of antitrust rules and how they a#ect their daily business.\nQuestions and feedback received on the application of training content, including in the context of sustainability initiatives, show the positive impact and e\"cacy of the training.\nVoicing concerns\nAllianz o#ers employees multiple channels for raising concerns.\nEmployees are encouraged to report breaches and misconduct. They are given information on where and how to do so. These include via management, speaking directly with Group Compliance, by e-mail, and anonymously via a third-party solution provided by Business Keeper GmbH and accessible via the intranet.\nThe same tool is also accessible to external parties via Allianz.com. Some operating entities provide employees with the option to report via an ombudsman.\n05 Our universal principles\nAll reported incidents are assessed, documented and managed according to internal guidelines and confidentiality is strictly adhered to.\nGroup Compliance runs an annual awareness campaign to remind employees of the avenues for reporting.\nOur actions in 2022\nIn 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance Departments.\nIn the past, the focus was primarily\non local implementation of global programs (e.g., Sanctions, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, etc.) to ascertain the Compliance Culture of operating entities. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to fulfill scope coverage and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities.\nThe changes also reinforce a compliance- by-default and by-design mindset through an evaluation of the status (e.g., standing) of a compliance function within the enterprise (e.g., the compliance function has a role/voice in major strategic and operational considerations).\nAllianz maintains appropriate,\nrisk-based processes for the identification, mitigation and management of the\nTrade Sanctions risk posed by specific transactions. Allianz respects the Trade Sanctions restrictions imposed under\nthe laws applicable to the businesses. Trade Sanctions review processes\ninclude identifying, analyzing and taking appropriate actions in respect of any payments or transactions (including contractual arrangements, financial services or any types of insurance business, amendments, extensions, or renewals) that are related to a Sanctioned Country.\nFair competition\nWe believe fair competition and access to the market drives innovation, stimulates growth and benefits\nthe consumer.\nAs a global player and a leading provider in our sector, we have a responsibility to act in compliance with competition law.\nTo meet this responsibility, the global Allianz Antitrust Program consists of the Allianz Antitrust Standard and the Antitrust Code.\nThe Standard lays out core principles and measures to be adopted across the Group to ensure compliance with antitrust law. The Code provides a set of core behavioral\nThis holistic approach was initiated in 2021 through the Compliance Assurance of Risks and E!ectiveness (CARE) program.\nWhile CARE is primarily a self- assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. From 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three-yearly cycle.\nThe program is aligned to the CARE program so that operating entities are encouraged to exercise more rigor in the assessment of control e!ectiveness against the background of anticipated confirmation activities.\nGroup Compliance is itself subject to external, independent evaluation by one of the four largest accounting firms. It is evaluated based upon CARE elaborated criteria which have been certified as being compliant with regulations which define requirements for compliance organizations.\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and e!ectiveness of individual programs such as Anti-Trust, Sales Compliance, etc.\nThe benefit of this multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit\nis the ability to learn from local and group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview\nof issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow- up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\nopic\nCompliance\nObjectives\nProgress and actions 2022\n\u2022 Complete the cycle of the integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS process.\n\u2022 Continue to enhance the e\"ectiveness of local compliance organizations by enriching our compliance reviews, to bolster further the governance and processes of underlying compliance organizations across our OEs.\n\u2022 Completed the 2022 integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS.\n\u2022 2022 Compliance Review Plan executed.\n\nOur success is built on the trust that our customers, investors, employees and the public have in our performance and integrity.

All operating entities must, at a minimum, use the sanctions lists issued by the European Union, United Nations, the US O\"ce of Foreign Assets Control, the US Bureau\nof International Security and Non- Proliferation, the US Department of State, the US Treasury and the United Kingdom\u2019s HM Treasury, in addition to all other locally and regionally applicable lists.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\n127\n02 Measuring and 03 Climate change managing sustainability related disclosure\n04 Strengthening our foundation\nrules that employees must observe when dealing with competitors, customers and business partners.\nAs in previous years, we provided regular classroom and online training in 2022\nto top management and exposed employees to refresh and develop their understanding of antitrust rules and how they a#ect their daily business.\nQuestions and feedback received on the application of training content, including in the context of sustainability initiatives, show the positive impact and e\"cacy of the training.\nVoicing concerns\nAllianz o#ers employees multiple channels for raising concerns.\nEmployees are encouraged to report breaches and misconduct. They are given information on where and how to do so. These include via management, speaking directly with Group Compliance, by e-mail, and anonymously via a third-party solution provided by Business Keeper GmbH and accessible via the intranet.\nThe same tool is also accessible to external parties via Allianz.com. Some operating entities provide employees with the option to report via an ombudsman.\n05 Our universal principles\nAll reported incidents are assessed, documented and managed according to internal guidelines and confidentiality is strictly adhered to.\nGroup Compliance runs an annual awareness campaign to remind employees of the avenues for reporting.\nOur actions in 2022\nIn 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance Departments.\nIn the past, the focus was primarily\non local implementation of global programs (e.g., Sanctions, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, etc.) to ascertain the Compliance Culture of operating entities. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to fulfill scope coverage and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities.\nThe changes also reinforce a compliance- by-default and by-design mindset through an evaluation of the status (e.g., standing) of a compliance function within the enterprise (e.g., the compliance function has a role/voice in major strategic and operational considerations).\nAllianz maintains appropriate,\nrisk-based processes for the identification, mitigation and management of the\nTrade Sanctions risk posed by specific transactions. Allianz respects the Trade Sanctions restrictions imposed under\nthe laws applicable to the businesses. Trade Sanctions review processes\ninclude identifying, analyzing and taking appropriate actions in respect of any payments or transactions (including contractual arrangements, financial services or any types of insurance business, amendments, extensions, or renewals) that are related to a Sanctioned Country.\nFair competition\nWe believe fair competition and access to the market drives innovation, stimulates growth and benefits\nthe consumer.\nAs a global player and a leading provider in our sector, we have a responsibility to act in compliance with competition law.\nTo meet this responsibility, the global Allianz Antitrust Program consists of the Allianz Antitrust Standard and the Antitrust Code.\nThe Standard lays out core principles and measures to be adopted across the Group to ensure compliance with antitrust law. The Code provides a set of core behavioral\n\n 01 Introduction and strategy\n04.3 Compliance\nThis holistic approach was initiated in 2021 through the Compliance Assurance of Risks and E!ectiveness (CARE) program.\nWhile CARE is primarily a self- assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. From 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three-yearly cycle.\nThe program is aligned to the CARE program so that operating entities are encouraged to exercise more rigor in the assessment of control e!ectiveness against the background of anticipated confirmation activities.\nGroup Compliance is itself subject to external, independent evaluation by one of the four largest accounting firms. It is evaluated based upon CARE elaborated criteria which have been certified as being compliant with regulations which define requirements for compliance organizations.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\n128\n02 Measuring and 03 Climate change managing sustainability related disclosure\n04 Strengthening our foundation\n05 Our universal principles\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and e!ectiveness of individual programs such as Anti-Trust, Sales Compliance, etc.\nThe benefit of this multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit\nis the ability to learn from local and group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview\nof issues detected in the course of the above activities.

The regulation came into effect last year and Allianz is reporting the eligibility (described subsequently) for the second time.\nEU Taxonomy recognizes as \u2018\u201cgreen\u2019\u201d, or \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d economic activities that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards. It is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some undertakings (namely, the ones in scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) prospectively) for financial market participants. The disclosure of the proportion of taxonomy- aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions. However, the EU Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on environmental performance for companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in.\nEconomic activities that are not recognized by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives are not necessarily environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that could generally make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are already part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Rather, the first Delegated Act (namely, the Climate Delegated Act) under the EU taxonomy sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant for achieving climate neutrality and delivering on climate change objectives. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings.\nAt this stage, the regulation has only established \u2018\u201cTechnical Screening Criteria\u2019\u201d for (a) climate change mitigation and (b) climate change adaptation, which are laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives will follow in a future Delegated Act, in line with the mandates outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn addition, extensions of the Taxonomy Regulation with view to (a) economic activities that do not have a significant impact on environmental sustainability and economic activities that significantly harm environmental sustainability, as well as (b) regarding other sustainability objectives, such as social objectives, may follow at a later stage.\nFurthermore, the Disclosures Delegated Act requires the EU Commission to review the application of this regulation by 30 June 2024, and to assess in particular the need for any further amendments with regard to the inclusion of (a) exposures to central governments and central banks in the numerator and denominator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings, and (b) exposures to undertakings that do not publish a non-financial statement pursuant to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the numerator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings.\nOverall, this means that the Taxonomy Regulation will evolve further over coming years, translating into an extension of the expected screening and reporting scope alongside various dimensions.\nFor a transitional period of two years, a simplified approach applies for the financial sector. In this context, only eligibility has to be reported. This means that we only report on (investments into) economic activities which are in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation, i.e., described in the Climate Delegated Act! irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down therein.\nThus, taxonomy \u201celigibility\u201d of an economic activity implies that respective Technical Screening Criteria are available and the activity could generally make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives of the taxonomy. Whether an activity is taxonomy-eligible, or not, provides no indication about how green or environmentally sustainable that activity is. This will only be possible with the future alignment KPI.\nTaxonomy \u201calignment\u201d of an activity goes beyond taxonomy eligibility. It implies that an activity complies with the requirements defined specifically for this particular activity in the Technical Screening Criteria of the taxonomy. For example, to be \u201ctaxonomy- aligned\u201d under the current taxonomy, an activity has to fulfill the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a substantial contribution to the climate objectives as outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. For example, for an activity to be considered \u2018taxonomy-aligned\u2018 it must meet the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a significant contribution to the climate objectives set out in the delegated act on climate. In addition, the criterion of \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d and minimum social safeguards must be met. Allianz is reporting taxonomy eligibility for the second year. Taxonomy alignment will be reported from the financial year 2023 onwards.\nThe Disclosures Delegated Act specifies the disclosure obligations under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn order to ensure comparability of the taxonomy information with the Group's financial disclosure, we report for each of our material financial activities. Consequently, the Allianz Group will report on the following activities:\n\u2212 non-life insurance,\n\u2212 proprietary investments, and \u2212 third-party investments.\nNon-life insurance (and thereof eight Solvency II Lines of Business (LoBs)) is one economic activity in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation (\u201ctaxonomy-eligible\u201d), as it is generally deemed as able to have a positive enabling function with a view to climate change adaptation.\nIn the non-life insurance business, the Allianz Group is active in all the eight LoBs that can generally be considered as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation! the same applies for the AllianzGroup\u2019s reinsurance business accepted from external counterparties. Namely\nC _ Group Management Report\n     Annual Report 2022 ! Allianz Group\n73\n\nC _ Group Management Report\nreinsurance business of eligible insurance activities can be considered as taxonomy-eligible. The extent to which individual contracts include protection against climate-related perils (e.g., flood events or hail storms) depends on the individual demand and the requirements of the customer\u2019s typical situation or unique risk exposure. Risk analysis and product advice is an integral part of our sales process and we are pursuing the objective to close insurance coverage gaps as far as possible.\nWe integrate climate protection into our core business and we embed the management of risks and opportunities resulting from climate change in our overall business strategy. Measures include developing and adjusting financial products and services, updating policies and processes, setting targets and limits, managing our operational climate footprint, and engaging with internal and external stakeholders. As a treaty reinsurer of external clients, we consider the climate-related strategies of these insurance companies as part of our underwriting process in order to live up to our decarbonization commitments.\nThe information about taxonomy eligibility in our underwriting portfolio is an indication of the scope of our activities that can generally be assessed against the specific technical screening criteria for taxonomy-alignment applying to (re-)insurers, and therefore have the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation. A LoB must contain at least one policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils to be considered as taxonomy-eligible. On the one hand, the Allianz Group offers policies in the LoBs of \u201dother motor insurance\u201d, \u201cmarine, aviation and transport insurance\u201d and \u201cfire and damage to property insurance\u201d, where protection against climate perils is explicitly included. On the other hand, the Allianz Group offers policies that are based on a general protection approach, thus covering all risks, including (yet, not explicitly referring to) climate perils in the five remaining LoBs \u201cmedical expense insurance\u201d, \u201cincome protection insurance\u201d, \u201cworkers\u201d compensation insurance\u201d, \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d, and \u201cassistance\u201d. Allianz generally considers both types of LoBs as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation, as they all comprise policies that cover against climate perils. The most material eligible LoBs, in terms of gross written premiums, are \u201cfire and other damage to property insurance\u201d, \u201cother motor insurance\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d.\nsubstantial contribution to climate change adaptation at a broad level.\nFor investments, the Taxonomy Regulation currently limits the scope of which investments and non-financial investments, including real estate, that could generally be considered as \u201ctaxonomy-eligible\u201d to exposures to undertakings that are obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. This means that for taxonomy reporting as an investor, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe eligibility share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments. In addition, mortgages and real estate held for investment are considered 100% eligible and are included in the reported figures. In addition, Allianz considers investments in real estate funds (with non-controlling interest) to be eligible. However, for such investments we do not expect to be able to acquire the necessary information to assess their taxonomy-alignment, hence we expect to report them as non-aligned due to lack of data.\nAdditionally, several asset classes, which are material for the Allianz Group, cannot be considered taxonomy-eligible as of now, such as sovereign bonds or non-EEA investments (except for own investments, for example in real estate and mortgages). This applies for both proprietary and third-party assets.\nThe Allianz Group uses Moody\u2019s Analytics to source listed asset eligibility data, and uses only reported data (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at an issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent level data is sourced. And in case that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data of the ultimate entity. Taxonomy eligibility is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data.\nThe taxonomy eligibility share for the Allianz Group\u2019s proprietary investments is based on listed equities and corporate bonds from NFRD companies, where reported data is available. In addition, we assessed controlled listed or unlisted assets and debt instruments that are held by our (internal) asset managers, or other subsidiaries (e.g., real estate investments or mortgages) and where Allianz has control under IFRS.\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year of 2022 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level (see more detail in the \u201cLimitations of reported numbers\u201d section).\nIn order to provide transparency about the sustainability of our portfolio beyond what the taxonomy KPIs currently allow, we disclose additional voluntary information on the sustainability of our proprietary investments portfolio at Group-level, based on the definition of \u201cSustainable Investments\u201d as per the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group \u0301s activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by the Group Compliance team.\nOur Compliance Management System helps ensure compliance with internationally recognized laws, rules and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the German Institute for Compliance and the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\nCompliance risk is part of the operational risk category, as laid down in the Allianz Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). OEs in scope of IRCS are defined by Group Risk. They are required to conduct an annual compliance risk assessment based on Group-defined risk scenarios. Together with the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE), they form the annual cycle of our integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities.\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program was initiated. In 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, assure adequate skills to ensure complete and effective scope coverage, and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities. While CARE is primarily a self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five- yearly cycle. Starting 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three- year cycle\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust, Sales Compliance, etc. The benefit of this multi!faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, the frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit is the ability to learn from local and Group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nObjectives and actions: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\nTopic     Objectives\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview of issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow-up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\nThe gathered information provides the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the AllianzSE Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee, chaired by Group Compliance, reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\nAs part of our global compliance program, we follow international standards and applicable laws related to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz- specific rules.\nThe Allianz Group CoC outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. As part of a project led by Group Compliance, the CoC was fundamentally renewed in 2020 and approved by the Board of Management. The new CoC has since then been rolled out across the Group, along with training for operating entities to raise awareness about the principles established by the CoC, namely mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\nOur target is zero fraud and corruption across our business and our principle is zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption. We consider fraud and corruption as a serious offence. The aforementioned principle is of absolute and of a primary nature. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits from the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. This principle expresses Allianz\u2019s stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt offer, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving \u201cAnything of Value\u201d (defined broadly to include anything - monetary or non-monetary - that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\nProgress and actions 2022\n- Completed the 2022 integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS.\n- 2022 Compliance Review Plan executed.\n        Compliance\n- Complete the cycle of the integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS process.\n- Continue to enhance the effectiveness of local compliance organizations by enriching our compliance reviews, to bolster further the governance and processes of underlying compliance organizations across our OEs.\n      72\nAnnual Report 2022 !

Our target is to conduct a comprehensive update of the materiality analysis every three years in line with regulatory, reporting and rating agency guidelines.\nWe intend to undergo, latest for\nfiscal year 2024, a comprehensive materiality assessment process which will be in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) provisions, which will include identifying material sustainability matters from an impact perspective (our impact on the environment and people) and a financial\n1 CorporateSustainabilityReportingDirective.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\nperspective (risks and opportunities related 2. to sustainability matters).\nFor 2022, there were no significant changes to the process or list of material topics compared to the previous year.\nMateriality\nassessment process\nOur most recent assessment was carried out in 2021 in line with the 2016 GRI Standards requirements and is still applicable\nfor 2022.\nOur assessment approach used a variety of data sources and we improved our methodology in 2021 by increasing the number of data sources and the number of data points within these sources.\n1. Identification: We identified a list\nof sustainability topics that impact\nthe economy, environment and\nsociety. These were tailored to our business through a desk-based review of our own prior material topics,\npeers\u2019 materiality matrices, a media review using the HLG Brand Pressure Index and RepRisk data, NGO-relevant topics using SigWatch data and independent expert opinion from a specialist consultancy according to their significance.\n3. Analysis and validation: We aggregated and analyzed data, integrating the results into a materiality map, and presented results to the internal expert pool of representatives including Group Risk, Group Communications, Group Compliance, Group Legal, Group Accounting and Reporting, as well as Global Sustainability. This group also provided the final judgment of outcomes.\nFor a full description of the materiality assessment process we followed,\nrefer to page 101 of our 2021 Sustainability Report.\n05.7.1 Our material issues\nOur assessment in 2021 identified 19 material issues which were prioritized as either having high or medium importance.\nTopics are ranked and presented in\na materiality matrix along two axes according to stakeholder views on their importance to society and to our business.\n\n\n 01 Introduction 02 Measuring and 03 Climate change 04 Strengthening and strategy managing sustainability related disclosure our foundation\n05.8 Independent Practitioner\u2019s Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Sustainability Information\n05 Our universal principles\nIn a limited assurance engagement\nthe assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained.\nThe assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner\u2019s judgment.\nWithin the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed amongst others the following assurance procedures and further activities:\n\u2022 Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement\n\u2022 Assessment of the process for conducting the materiality analysis in accordance with the GRI criteria\n\u2022 Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Report regarding the preparation process, the internal control system relating to this process and selected disclosures in the Report\n\u2022 Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the Report under consideration of the GRI-Criteria\nTo Allianz SE, Munich\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures in the sustainability report of Allianz SE, Munich (hereinafter \u201cthe Company\u201d), for the period from January 1, 2022\nto December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the \u201cReport\u201d).\nResponsibilities of the\nExecutive Directors\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the \u201cGRI-Criteria\u201d).\nThis responsibility of Company\u2019s executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate methods of sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures,\nwhich are reasonable in the circumstances.

The aforementioned principle is of absolute and primary importance. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits\nfrom the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery, and corruption.\nThis principle expresses Allianz\u2019s stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt o#er, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited\nfrom directly or indirectly o#ering, requesting, accepting, providing,\npaying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving \u2018Anything of Value\u2019 (defined broadly to include anything \u2013 monetary or non-monetary \u2013 that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any Public O$cial or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\nAnti-money laundering\nWe follow international standards and applicable laws related to money laundering and terrorism financing.\nAllianz regularly assesses the obligations of all operating entities under applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Each entity in the Group is required to determine and document whether any of their legal entities and/or branches is an AML-Obliged Entity (i.e., an entity subject to local AML law) under applicable\nlocal law.\nEach relevant entity must define a reasonable AML Program Framework that describes the AML Program, documents and describes the processes, procedures and controls that constitute\n05 Our universal principles\nthe AML-Obliged Entity\u2019s methods to execute the Internal Safeguards as outlined in the Allianz Standard for the Prevention of Financial Crime and Functional Rule.\nAt a minimum the AML Framework Program usually include rules regarding:\n\u2022 Scope of application of AML law\"\n\u2022 The AML risk assessment\"\n\u2022 Customer due diligence and transaction monitoring\"\n\u2022 Reporting requirements for suspicious activity\"\n\u2022 Communication, training and awareness\"\n\u2022 Record retention and protection of personal data\"\n\u2022 Reliability screening of employees\"\n\u2022\n\u2022 Ensuring appropriate measures to prevent the abuse of new products and technologies\"\n\u2022 Information sharing (group-wide if applicable)\"\n\nRespecting economic sanctions and embargoes\nAllianz is strongly committed to conducting business in full compliance and accordance with all applicable Economic Sanctions.\nThis means taking all reasonable steps to identify and mitigate the sanctions risks relevant in the business, including risks arising under local law as well as under foreign law (such as in certain cross-border transactions or in cases where extra- territorial sanctions laws are relevant due to links to that foreign jurisdiction or for other reasons).\nAny ambiguity regarding economic sanctions risk or the applicability of sanctions laws should be addressed with regard to the intention of the relevant sanctions regime.\nAllianz identifies and addresses financial sanctions risks by using financial sanctions screening tools. All operating entities must, at a minimum, use the sanctions lists issued by the European Union, United Nations, the US O\"ce of Foreign Assets Control, the US Bureau\nof International Security and Non- Proliferation, the US Department of State, the US Treasury and the United Kingdom\u2019s HM Treasury, in addition to all other locally and regionally applicable lists.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\n127\n02 Measuring and 03 Climate change managing sustainability related disclosure\n04 Strengthening our foundation\nrules that employees must observe when dealing with competitors, customers and business partners.\nAs in previous years, we provided regular classroom and online training in 2022\nto top management and exposed employees to refresh and develop their understanding of antitrust rules and how they a#ect their daily business.\nQuestions and feedback received on the application of training content, including in the context of sustainability initiatives, show the positive impact and e\"cacy of the training.\nVoicing concerns\nAllianz o#ers employees multiple channels for raising concerns.\nEmployees are encouraged to report breaches and misconduct. They are given information on where and how to do so. These include via management, speaking directly with Group Compliance, by e-mail, and anonymously via a third-party solution provided by Business Keeper GmbH and accessible via the intranet.\nThe same tool is also accessible to external parties via Allianz.com. Some operating entities provide employees with the option to report via an ombudsman.\n05 Our universal principles\nAll reported incidents are assessed, documented and managed according to internal guidelines and confidentiality is strictly adhered to.\nGroup Compliance runs an annual awareness campaign to remind employees of the avenues for reporting.\nOur actions in 2022\nIn 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance Departments.\nIn the past, the focus was primarily\non local implementation of global programs (e.g., Sanctions, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, etc.) to ascertain the Compliance Culture of operating entities. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to fulfill scope coverage and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities.\nThe changes also reinforce a compliance- by-default and by-design mindset through an evaluation of the status (e.g., standing) of a compliance function within the enterprise (e.g., the compliance function has a role/voice in major strategic and operational considerations).\nAllianz maintains appropriate,\nrisk-based processes for the identification, mitigation and management of the\nTrade Sanctions risk posed by specific transactions. Allianz respects the Trade Sanctions restrictions imposed under\nthe laws applicable to the businesses. Trade Sanctions review processes\ninclude identifying, analyzing and taking appropriate actions in respect of any payments or transactions (including contractual arrangements, financial services or any types of insurance business, amendments, extensions, or renewals) that are related to a Sanctioned Country.\nFair competition\nWe believe fair competition and access to the market drives innovation, stimulates growth and benefits\nthe consumer.\nAs a global player and a leading provider in our sector, we have a responsibility to act in compliance with competition law.\nTo meet this responsibility, the global Allianz Antitrust Program consists of the Allianz Antitrust Standard and the Antitrust Code.\nThe Standard lays out core principles and measures to be adopted across the Group to ensure compliance with antitrust law. The Code provides a set of core behavioral\nThis holistic approach was initiated in 2021 through the Compliance Assurance of Risks and E!ectiveness (CARE) program.\nWhile CARE is primarily a self- assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. From 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three-yearly cycle.\nThe program is aligned to the CARE program so that operating entities are encouraged to exercise more rigor in the assessment of control e!ectiveness against the background of anticipated confirmation activities.\nGroup Compliance is itself subject to external, independent evaluation by one of the four largest accounting firms. It is evaluated based upon CARE elaborated criteria which have been certified as being compliant with regulations which define requirements for compliance organizations.\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and e!ectiveness of individual programs such as Anti-Trust, Sales Compliance, etc.\nThe benefit of this multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit\nis the ability to learn from local and group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview\nof issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow- up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\nopic\nCompliance\nObjectives\nProgress and actions 2022\n\u2022 Complete the cycle of the integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS process.\n\u2022 Continue to enhance the e\"ectiveness of local compliance organizations by enriching our compliance reviews, to bolster further the governance and processes of underlying compliance organizations across our OEs.\n\u2022 Completed the 2022 integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS.\n\u2022 2022 Compliance Review Plan executed.\n\nOur success is built on the trust that our customers, investors, employees and the public have in our performance and integrity.

Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to fulfill scope coverage and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities.\nThe changes also reinforce a compliance- by-default and by-design mindset through an evaluation of the status (e.g., standing) of a compliance function within the enterprise (e.g., the compliance function has a role/voice in major strategic and operational considerations).\nAllianz maintains appropriate,\nrisk-based processes for the identification, mitigation and management of the\nTrade Sanctions risk posed by specific transactions. Allianz respects the Trade Sanctions restrictions imposed under\nthe laws applicable to the businesses. Trade Sanctions review processes\ninclude identifying, analyzing and taking appropriate actions in respect of any payments or transactions (including contractual arrangements, financial services or any types of insurance business, amendments, extensions, or renewals) that are related to a Sanctioned Country.\nFair competition\nWe believe fair competition and access to the market drives innovation, stimulates growth and benefits\nthe consumer.\nAs a global player and a leading provider in our sector, we have a responsibility to act in compliance with competition law.\nTo meet this responsibility, the global Allianz Antitrust Program consists of the Allianz Antitrust Standard and the Antitrust Code.\nThe Standard lays out core principles and measures to be adopted across the Group to ensure compliance with antitrust law. The Code provides a set of core behavioral\n\n 01 Introduction and strategy\n04.3 Compliance\nThis holistic approach was initiated in 2021 through the Compliance Assurance of Risks and E!ectiveness (CARE) program.\nWhile CARE is primarily a self- assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. From 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three-yearly cycle.\nThe program is aligned to the CARE program so that operating entities are encouraged to exercise more rigor in the assessment of control e!ectiveness against the background of anticipated confirmation activities.\nGroup Compliance is itself subject to external, independent evaluation by one of the four largest accounting firms. It is evaluated based upon CARE elaborated criteria which have been certified as being compliant with regulations which define requirements for compliance organizations.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\n128\n02 Measuring and 03 Climate change managing sustainability related disclosure\n04 Strengthening our foundation\n05 Our universal principles\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and e!ectiveness of individual programs such as Anti-Trust, Sales Compliance, etc.\nThe benefit of this multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit\nis the ability to learn from local and group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview\nof issues detected in the course of the above activities.

The regulation came into effect last year and Allianz is reporting the eligibility (described subsequently) for the second time.\nEU Taxonomy recognizes as \u2018\u201cgreen\u2019\u201d, or \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d economic activities that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards. It is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some undertakings (namely, the ones in scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) prospectively) for financial market participants. The disclosure of the proportion of taxonomy- aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions. However, the EU Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on environmental performance for companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in.\nEconomic activities that are not recognized by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives are not necessarily environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that could generally make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are already part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Rather, the first Delegated Act (namely, the Climate Delegated Act) under the EU taxonomy sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant for achieving climate neutrality and delivering on climate change objectives. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings.\nAt this stage, the regulation has only established \u2018\u201cTechnical Screening Criteria\u2019\u201d for (a) climate change mitigation and (b) climate change adaptation, which are laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives will follow in a future Delegated Act, in line with the mandates outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn addition, extensions of the Taxonomy Regulation with view to (a) economic activities that do not have a significant impact on environmental sustainability and economic activities that significantly harm environmental sustainability, as well as (b) regarding other sustainability objectives, such as social objectives, may follow at a later stage.\nFurthermore, the Disclosures Delegated Act requires the EU Commission to review the application of this regulation by 30 June 2024, and to assess in particular the need for any further amendments with regard to the inclusion of (a) exposures to central governments and central banks in the numerator and denominator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings, and (b) exposures to undertakings that do not publish a non-financial statement pursuant to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the numerator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings.\nOverall, this means that the Taxonomy Regulation will evolve further over coming years, translating into an extension of the expected screening and reporting scope alongside various dimensions.\nFor a transitional period of two years, a simplified approach applies for the financial sector. In this context, only eligibility has to be reported. This means that we only report on (investments into) economic activities which are in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation, i.e., described in the Climate Delegated Act! irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down therein.\nThus, taxonomy \u201celigibility\u201d of an economic activity implies that respective Technical Screening Criteria are available and the activity could generally make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives of the taxonomy. Whether an activity is taxonomy-eligible, or not, provides no indication about how green or environmentally sustainable that activity is. This will only be possible with the future alignment KPI.\nTaxonomy \u201calignment\u201d of an activity goes beyond taxonomy eligibility. It implies that an activity complies with the requirements defined specifically for this particular activity in the Technical Screening Criteria of the taxonomy. For example, to be \u201ctaxonomy- aligned\u201d under the current taxonomy, an activity has to fulfill the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a substantial contribution to the climate objectives as outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. For example, for an activity to be considered \u2018taxonomy-aligned\u2018 it must meet the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a significant contribution to the climate objectives set out in the delegated act on climate. In addition, the criterion of \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d and minimum social safeguards must be met. Allianz is reporting taxonomy eligibility for the second year. Taxonomy alignment will be reported from the financial year 2023 onwards.\nThe Disclosures Delegated Act specifies the disclosure obligations under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn order to ensure comparability of the taxonomy information with the Group's financial disclosure, we report for each of our material financial activities. Consequently, the Allianz Group will report on the following activities:\n\u2212 non-life insurance,\n\u2212 proprietary investments, and \u2212 third-party investments.\nNon-life insurance (and thereof eight Solvency II Lines of Business (LoBs)) is one economic activity in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation (\u201ctaxonomy-eligible\u201d), as it is generally deemed as able to have a positive enabling function with a view to climate change adaptation.\nIn the non-life insurance business, the Allianz Group is active in all the eight LoBs that can generally be considered as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation! the same applies for the AllianzGroup\u2019s reinsurance business accepted from external counterparties. Namely\nC _ Group Management Report\n     Annual Report 2022 ! Allianz Group\n73\n\nC _ Group Management Report\nreinsurance business of eligible insurance activities can be considered as taxonomy-eligible. The extent to which individual contracts include protection against climate-related perils (e.g., flood events or hail storms) depends on the individual demand and the requirements of the customer\u2019s typical situation or unique risk exposure. Risk analysis and product advice is an integral part of our sales process and we are pursuing the objective to close insurance coverage gaps as far as possible.\nWe integrate climate protection into our core business and we embed the management of risks and opportunities resulting from climate change in our overall business strategy. Measures include developing and adjusting financial products and services, updating policies and processes, setting targets and limits, managing our operational climate footprint, and engaging with internal and external stakeholders. As a treaty reinsurer of external clients, we consider the climate-related strategies of these insurance companies as part of our underwriting process in order to live up to our decarbonization commitments.\nThe information about taxonomy eligibility in our underwriting portfolio is an indication of the scope of our activities that can generally be assessed against the specific technical screening criteria for taxonomy-alignment applying to (re-)insurers, and therefore have the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation. A LoB must contain at least one policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils to be considered as taxonomy-eligible. On the one hand, the Allianz Group offers policies in the LoBs of \u201dother motor insurance\u201d, \u201cmarine, aviation and transport insurance\u201d and \u201cfire and damage to property insurance\u201d, where protection against climate perils is explicitly included. On the other hand, the Allianz Group offers policies that are based on a general protection approach, thus covering all risks, including (yet, not explicitly referring to) climate perils in the five remaining LoBs \u201cmedical expense insurance\u201d, \u201cincome protection insurance\u201d, \u201cworkers\u201d compensation insurance\u201d, \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d, and \u201cassistance\u201d. Allianz generally considers both types of LoBs as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation, as they all comprise policies that cover against climate perils. The most material eligible LoBs, in terms of gross written premiums, are \u201cfire and other damage to property insurance\u201d, \u201cother motor insurance\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d.\nsubstantial contribution to climate change adaptation at a broad level.\nFor investments, the Taxonomy Regulation currently limits the scope of which investments and non-financial investments, including real estate, that could generally be considered as \u201ctaxonomy-eligible\u201d to exposures to undertakings that are obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. This means that for taxonomy reporting as an investor, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe eligibility share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments. In addition, mortgages and real estate held for investment are considered 100% eligible and are included in the reported figures. In addition, Allianz considers investments in real estate funds (with non-controlling interest) to be eligible. However, for such investments we do not expect to be able to acquire the necessary information to assess their taxonomy-alignment, hence we expect to report them as non-aligned due to lack of data.\nAdditionally, several asset classes, which are material for the Allianz Group, cannot be considered taxonomy-eligible as of now, such as sovereign bonds or non-EEA investments (except for own investments, for example in real estate and mortgages). This applies for both proprietary and third-party assets.\nThe Allianz Group uses Moody\u2019s Analytics to source listed asset eligibility data, and uses only reported data (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at an issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent level data is sourced. And in case that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data of the ultimate entity. Taxonomy eligibility is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data.\nThe taxonomy eligibility share for the Allianz Group\u2019s proprietary investments is based on listed equities and corporate bonds from NFRD companies, where reported data is available. In addition, we assessed controlled listed or unlisted assets and debt instruments that are held by our (internal) asset managers, or other subsidiaries (e.g., real estate investments or mortgages) and where Allianz has control under IFRS.\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year of 2022 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level (see more detail in the \u201cLimitations of reported numbers\u201d section).\nIn order to provide transparency about the sustainability of our portfolio beyond what the taxonomy KPIs currently allow, we disclose additional voluntary information on the sustainability of our proprietary investments portfolio at Group-level, based on the definition of \u201cSustainable Investments\u201d as per the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group \u0301s activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by the Group Compliance team.\nOur Compliance Management System helps ensure compliance with internationally recognized laws, rules and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the German Institute for Compliance and the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\nCompliance risk is part of the operational risk category, as laid down in the Allianz Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). OEs in scope of IRCS are defined by Group Risk. They are required to conduct an annual compliance risk assessment based on Group-defined risk scenarios. Together with the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE), they form the annual cycle of our integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities.\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program was initiated. In 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, assure adequate skills to ensure complete and effective scope coverage, and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities. While CARE is primarily a self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five- yearly cycle. Starting 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three- year cycle\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust, Sales Compliance, etc. The benefit of this multi!faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, the frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit is the ability to learn from local and Group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nObjectives and actions: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\nTopic     Objectives\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview of issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow-up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\nThe gathered information provides the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the AllianzSE Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee, chaired by Group Compliance, reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\nAs part of our global compliance program, we follow international standards and applicable laws related to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz- specific rules.\nThe Allianz Group CoC outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. As part of a project led by Group Compliance, the CoC was fundamentally renewed in 2020 and approved by the Board of Management. The new CoC has since then been rolled out across the Group, along with training for operating entities to raise awareness about the principles established by the CoC, namely mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\nOur target is zero fraud and corruption across our business and our principle is zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption. We consider fraud and corruption as a serious offence. The aforementioned principle is of absolute and of a primary nature. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits from the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. This principle expresses Allianz\u2019s stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt offer, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving \u201cAnything of Value\u201d (defined broadly to include anything - monetary or non-monetary - that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\nProgress and actions 2022\n- Completed the 2022 integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS.\n- 2022 Compliance Review Plan executed.\n        Compliance\n- Complete the cycle of the integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS process.\n- Continue to enhance the effectiveness of local compliance organizations by enriching our compliance reviews, to bolster further the governance and processes of underlying compliance organizations across our OEs.\n      72\nAnnual Report 2022 !

Our target is to conduct a comprehensive update of the materiality analysis every three years in line with regulatory, reporting and rating agency guidelines.\nWe intend to undergo, latest for\nfiscal year 2024, a comprehensive materiality assessment process which will be in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) provisions, which will include identifying material sustainability matters from an impact perspective (our impact on the environment and people) and a financial\n1 CorporateSustainabilityReportingDirective.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\nperspective (risks and opportunities related 2. to sustainability matters).\nFor 2022, there were no significant changes to the process or list of material topics compared to the previous year.\nMateriality\nassessment process\nOur most recent assessment was carried out in 2021 in line with the 2016 GRI Standards requirements and is still applicable\nfor 2022.\nOur assessment approach used a variety of data sources and we improved our methodology in 2021 by increasing the number of data sources and the number of data points within these sources.\n1. Identification: We identified a list\nof sustainability topics that impact\nthe economy, environment and\nsociety. These were tailored to our business through a desk-based review of our own prior material topics,\npeers\u2019 materiality matrices, a media review using the HLG Brand Pressure Index and RepRisk data, NGO-relevant topics using SigWatch data and independent expert opinion from a specialist consultancy according to their significance.\n3. Analysis and validation: We aggregated and analyzed data, integrating the results into a materiality map, and presented results to the internal expert pool of representatives including Group Risk, Group Communications, Group Compliance, Group Legal, Group Accounting and Reporting, as well as Global Sustainability. This group also provided the final judgment of outcomes.\nFor a full description of the materiality assessment process we followed,\nrefer to page 101 of our 2021 Sustainability Report.\n05.7.1 Our material issues\nOur assessment in 2021 identified 19 material issues which were prioritized as either having high or medium importance.\nTopics are ranked and presented in\na materiality matrix along two axes according to stakeholder views on their importance to society and to our business.\n\n\n 01 Introduction 02 Measuring and 03 Climate change 04 Strengthening and strategy managing sustainability related disclosure our foundation\n05.8 Independent Practitioner\u2019s Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Sustainability Information\n05 Our universal principles\nIn a limited assurance engagement\nthe assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained.\nThe assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner\u2019s judgment.\nWithin the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed amongst others the following assurance procedures and further activities:\n\u2022 Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement\n\u2022 Assessment of the process for conducting the materiality analysis in accordance with the GRI criteria\n\u2022 Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Report regarding the preparation process, the internal control system relating to this process and selected disclosures in the Report\n\u2022 Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the Report under consideration of the GRI-Criteria\nTo Allianz SE, Munich\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures in the sustainability report of Allianz SE, Munich (hereinafter \u201cthe Company\u201d), for the period from January 1, 2022\nto December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the \u201cReport\u201d).\nResponsibilities of the\nExecutive Directors\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the \u201cGRI-Criteria\u201d).\nThis responsibility of Company\u2019s executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate methods of sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures,\nwhich are reasonable in the circumstances.

The aforementioned principle is of absolute and primary importance. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits\nfrom the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery, and corruption.\nThis principle expresses Allianz\u2019s stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt o#er, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited\nfrom directly or indirectly o#ering, requesting, accepting, providing,\npaying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving \u2018Anything of Value\u2019 (defined broadly to include anything \u2013 monetary or non-monetary \u2013 that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any Public O$cial or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\nAnti-money laundering\nWe follow international standards and applicable laws related to money laundering and terrorism financing.\nAllianz regularly assesses the obligations of all operating entities under applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Each entity in the Group is required to determine and document whether any of their legal entities and/or branches is an AML-Obliged Entity (i.e., an entity subject to local AML law) under applicable\nlocal law.\nEach relevant entity must define a reasonable AML Program Framework that describes the AML Program, documents and describes the processes, procedures and controls that constitute\n05 Our universal principles\nthe AML-Obliged Entity\u2019s methods to execute the Internal Safeguards as outlined in the Allianz Standard for the Prevention of Financial Crime and Functional Rule.\nAt a minimum the AML Framework Program usually include rules regarding:\n\u2022 Scope of application of AML law\"\n\u2022 The AML risk assessment\"\n\u2022 Customer due diligence and transaction monitoring\"\n\u2022 Reporting requirements for suspicious activity\"\n\u2022 Communication, training and awareness\"\n\u2022 Record retention and protection of personal data\"\n\u2022 Reliability screening of employees\"\n\u2022\n\u2022 Ensuring appropriate measures to prevent the abuse of new products and technologies\"\n\u2022 Information sharing (group-wide if applicable)\"\n\nRespecting economic sanctions and embargoes\nAllianz is strongly committed to conducting business in full compliance and accordance with all applicable Economic Sanctions.\nThis means taking all reasonable steps to identify and mitigate the sanctions risks relevant in the business, including risks arising under local law as well as under foreign law (such as in certain cross-border transactions or in cases where extra- territorial sanctions laws are relevant due to links to that foreign jurisdiction or for other reasons).\nAny ambiguity regarding economic sanctions risk or the applicability of sanctions laws should be addressed with regard to the intention of the relevant sanctions regime.\nAllianz identifies and addresses financial sanctions risks by using financial sanctions screening tools. All operating entities must, at a minimum, use the sanctions lists issued by the European Union, United Nations, the US O\"ce of Foreign Assets Control, the US Bureau\nof International Security and Non- Proliferation, the US Department of State, the US Treasury and the United Kingdom\u2019s HM Treasury, in addition to all other locally and regionally applicable lists.\nAllianz Group Sustainability Report 2022\n127\n02 Measuring and 03 Climate change managing sustainability related disclosure\n04 Strengthening our foundation\nrules that employees must observe when dealing with competitors, customers and business partners.\nAs in previous years, we provided regular classroom and online training in 2022\nto top management and exposed employees to refresh and develop their understanding of antitrust rules and how they a#ect their daily business.\nQuestions and feedback received on the application of training content, including in the context of sustainability initiatives, show the positive impact and e\"cacy of the training.\nVoicing concerns\nAllianz o#ers employees multiple channels for raising concerns.\nEmployees are encouraged to report breaches and misconduct.

Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to fulfill scope coverage and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities.\nThe changes also reinforce a compliance- by-default and by-design mindset through an evaluation of the status (e.g., standing) of a compliance function within the enterprise (e.g., the compliance function has a role/voice in major strategic and operational considerations).\nAllianz maintains appropriate,\nrisk-based processes for the identification, mitigation and management of the\nTrade Sanctions risk posed by specific transactions.

Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. From 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three-yearly cycle.\nThe program is aligned to the CARE program so that operating entities are encouraged to exercise more rigor in the assessment of control e!ectiveness against the background of anticipated confirmation activities.\nGroup Compliance is itself subject to external, independent evaluation by one of the four largest accounting firms. It is evaluated based upon CARE elaborated criteria which have been certified as being compliant with regulations which define requirements for compliance organizations.\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and e!ectiveness of individual programs such as Anti-Trust, Sales Compliance, etc.\nThe benefit of this multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit\nis the ability to learn from local and group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview\nof issues detected in the course of the above activities.

The regulation came into effect last year and Allianz is reporting the eligibility (described subsequently) for the second time.\nEU Taxonomy recognizes as \u2018\u201cgreen\u2019\u201d, or \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d economic activities that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards. It is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some undertakings (namely, the ones in scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) prospectively) for financial market participants. The disclosure of the proportion of taxonomy- aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions. However, the EU Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on environmental performance for companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in.\nEconomic activities that are not recognized by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives are not necessarily environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that could generally make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are already part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Rather, the first Delegated Act (namely, the Climate Delegated Act) under the EU taxonomy sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant for achieving climate neutrality and delivering on climate change objectives. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings.\nAt this stage, the regulation has only established \u2018\u201cTechnical Screening Criteria\u2019\u201d for (a) climate change mitigation and (b) climate change adaptation, which are laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives will follow in a future Delegated Act, in line with the mandates outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn addition, extensions of the Taxonomy Regulation with view to (a) economic activities that do not have a significant impact on environmental sustainability and economic activities that significantly harm environmental sustainability, as well as (b) regarding other sustainability objectives, such as social objectives, may follow at a later stage.\nFurthermore, the Disclosures Delegated Act requires the EU Commission to review the application of this regulation by 30 June 2024, and to assess in particular the need for any further amendments with regard to the inclusion of (a) exposures to central governments and central banks in the numerator and denominator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings, and (b) exposures to undertakings that do not publish a non-financial statement pursuant to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the numerator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings.\nOverall, this means that the Taxonomy Regulation will evolve further over coming years, translating into an extension of the expected screening and reporting scope alongside various dimensions.\nFor a transitional period of two years, a simplified approach applies for the financial sector. In this context, only eligibility has to be reported. This means that we only report on (investments into) economic activities which are in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation, i.e., described in the Climate Delegated Act! irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down therein.\nThus, taxonomy \u201celigibility\u201d of an economic activity implies that respective Technical Screening Criteria are available and the activity could generally make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives of the taxonomy. Whether an activity is taxonomy-eligible, or not, provides no indication about how green or environmentally sustainable that activity is. This will only be possible with the future alignment KPI.\nTaxonomy \u201calignment\u201d of an activity goes beyond taxonomy eligibility. It implies that an activity complies with the requirements defined specifically for this particular activity in the Technical Screening Criteria of the taxonomy. For example, to be \u201ctaxonomy- aligned\u201d under the current taxonomy, an activity has to fulfill the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a substantial contribution to the climate objectives as outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. For example, for an activity to be considered \u2018taxonomy-aligned\u2018 it must meet the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a significant contribution to the climate objectives set out in the delegated act on climate. In addition, the criterion of \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d and minimum social safeguards must be met. Allianz is reporting taxonomy eligibility for the second year. Taxonomy alignment will be reported from the financial year 2023 onwards.\nThe Disclosures Delegated Act specifies the disclosure obligations under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn order to ensure comparability of the taxonomy information with the Group's financial disclosure, we report for each of our material financial activities. Consequently, the Allianz Group will report on the following activities:\n\u2212 non-life insurance,\n\u2212 proprietary investments, and \u2212 third-party investments.\nNon-life insurance (and thereof eight Solvency II Lines of Business (LoBs)) is one economic activity in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation (\u201ctaxonomy-eligible\u201d), as it is generally deemed as able to have a positive enabling function with a view to climate change adaptation.\nIn the non-life insurance business, the Allianz Group is active in all the eight LoBs that can generally be considered as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation! the same applies for the AllianzGroup\u2019s reinsurance business accepted from external counterparties. Namely\nC _ Group Management Report\n     Annual Report 2022 ! Allianz Group\n73\n\nC _ Group Management Report\nreinsurance business of eligible insurance activities can be considered as taxonomy-eligible. The extent to which individual contracts include protection against climate-related perils (e.g., flood events or hail storms) depends on the individual demand and the requirements of the customer\u2019s typical situation or unique risk exposure. Risk analysis and product advice is an integral part of our sales process and we are pursuing the objective to close insurance coverage gaps as far as possible.\nWe integrate climate protection into our core business and we embed the management of risks and opportunities resulting from climate change in our overall business strategy. Measures include developing and adjusting financial products and services, updating policies and processes, setting targets and limits, managing our operational climate footprint, and engaging with internal and external stakeholders. As a treaty reinsurer of external clients, we consider the climate-related strategies of these insurance companies as part of our underwriting process in order to live up to our decarbonization commitments.\nThe information about taxonomy eligibility in our underwriting portfolio is an indication of the scope of our activities that can generally be assessed against the specific technical screening criteria for taxonomy-alignment applying to (re-)insurers, and therefore have the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation. A LoB must contain at least one policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils to be considered as taxonomy-eligible. On the one hand, the Allianz Group offers policies in the LoBs of \u201dother motor insurance\u201d, \u201cmarine, aviation and transport insurance\u201d and \u201cfire and damage to property insurance\u201d, where protection against climate perils is explicitly included. On the other hand, the Allianz Group offers policies that are based on a general protection approach, thus covering all risks, including (yet, not explicitly referring to) climate perils in the five remaining LoBs \u201cmedical expense insurance\u201d, \u201cincome protection insurance\u201d, \u201cworkers\u201d compensation insurance\u201d, \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d, and \u201cassistance\u201d. Allianz generally considers both types of LoBs as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation, as they all comprise policies that cover against climate perils. The most material eligible LoBs, in terms of gross written premiums, are \u201cfire and other damage to property insurance\u201d, \u201cother motor insurance\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d.\nsubstantial contribution to climate change adaptation at a broad level.\nFor investments, the Taxonomy Regulation currently limits the scope of which investments and non-financial investments, including real estate, that could generally be considered as \u201ctaxonomy-eligible\u201d to exposures to undertakings that are obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. This means that for taxonomy reporting as an investor, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe eligibility share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments. In addition, mortgages and real estate held for investment are considered 100% eligible and are included in the reported figures. In addition, Allianz considers investments in real estate funds (with non-controlling interest) to be eligible. However, for such investments we do not expect to be able to acquire the necessary information to assess their taxonomy-alignment, hence we expect to report them as non-aligned due to lack of data.\nAdditionally, several asset classes, which are material for the Allianz Group, cannot be considered taxonomy-eligible as of now, such as sovereign bonds or non-EEA investments (except for own investments, for example in real estate and mortgages). This applies for both proprietary and third-party assets.\nThe Allianz Group uses Moody\u2019s Analytics to source listed asset eligibility data, and uses only reported data (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at an issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent level data is sourced. And in case that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data of the ultimate entity. Taxonomy eligibility is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data.\nThe taxonomy eligibility share for the Allianz Group\u2019s proprietary investments is based on listed equities and corporate bonds from NFRD companies, where reported data is available. In addition, we assessed controlled listed or unlisted assets and debt instruments that are held by our (internal) asset managers, or other subsidiaries (e.g., real estate investments or mortgages) and where Allianz has control under IFRS.\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year of 2022 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level (see more detail in the \u201cLimitations of reported numbers\u201d section).\nIn order to provide transparency about the sustainability of our portfolio beyond what the taxonomy KPIs currently allow, we disclose additional voluntary information on the sustainability of our proprietary investments portfolio at Group-level, based on the definition of \u201cSustainable Investments\u201d as per the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group \u0301s activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by the Group Compliance team.\nOur Compliance Management System helps ensure compliance with internationally recognized laws, rules and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the German Institute for Compliance and the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\nCompliance risk is part of the operational risk category, as laid down in the Allianz Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). OEs in scope of IRCS are defined by Group Risk. They are required to conduct an annual compliance risk assessment based on Group-defined risk scenarios. Together with the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE), they form the annual cycle of our integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities.\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program was initiated. In 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, assure adequate skills to ensure complete and effective scope coverage, and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities. While CARE is primarily a self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five- yearly cycle. Starting 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three- year cycle\nCompliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews. These assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust, Sales Compliance, etc. The benefit of this multi!faceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, the frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit is the ability to learn from local and Group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\nObjectives and actions: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\nTopic     Objectives\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview of issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow-up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\nThe gathered information provides the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the AllianzSE Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee, chaired by Group Compliance, reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\nAs part of our global compliance program, we follow international standards and applicable laws related to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz- specific rules.\nThe Allianz Group CoC outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. As part of a project led by Group Compliance, the CoC was fundamentally renewed in 2020 and approved by the Board of Management. The new CoC has since then been rolled out across the Group, along with training for operating entities to raise awareness about the principles established by the CoC, namely mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\nOur target is zero fraud and corruption across our business and our principle is zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption. We consider fraud and corruption as a serious offence. The aforementioned principle is of absolute and of a primary nature. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits from the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. This principle expresses Allianz\u2019s stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt offer, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving \u201cAnything of Value\u201d (defined broadly to include anything - monetary or non-monetary - that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\nAnti-corruption training must be provided at least once every three years to all employees.\nProgress and actions 2022\n- Completed the 2022 integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS.\n- 2022 Compliance Review Plan executed.\n        Compliance\n- Complete the cycle of the integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities as part of the company\u2019s IRCS process.\n- Continue to enhance the effectiveness of local compliance organizations by enriching our compliance reviews, to bolster further the governance and processes of underlying compliance organizations across our OEs.\n      72\nAnnual Report 2022 !

For business transactions located in these countries,\nwe carry out explicit due diligence in accordance with our Human Rights Guideline that covers various human rights violations.\nAdditional details on these human rights assessments can be found in section 02.1, table ESG-3.\nIn 2022, we carried out a review of the uman ights uideline and sensitive countries approach across all business lines and\n05 Our universal principles\ncore processes dealing with insurance, investment and procurement decisions.\nWe engaged with NGOs and consulting companies specialized in human rights\nto understand external stakeholder expectations and perspectives. The work is still on-going and our updated approach to human rights is expected to be finalized in 2023.\nIn terms of our investments, if we identify an issuer in our listed investment portfolio that is flagged for human rights issues\nby our external sustainability data provider, we prioritize this issuer in our engagement process.\n> See section 02.2. Data privacy\nAllianz is committed to the highest standards of data protection and privacy compliance by handling personal data responsibly, transparently, with due care, and in a fair and lawful manner.

These were tailored to our business through a desk-based review of our own prior material topics,\npeers\u2019 materiality matrices, a media review using the HLG Brand Pressure Index and RepRisk data, NGO-relevant topics using SigWatch data and independent expert opinion from a specialist consultancy according to their significance.\n3. Analysis and validation: We aggregated and analyzed data, integrating the results into a materiality map, and presented results to the internal expert pool of representatives including Group Risk, Group Communications, Group Compliance, Group Legal, Group Accounting and Reporting, as well as Global Sustainability. This group also provided the final judgment of outcomes.\nFor a full description of the materiality assessment process we followed,\nrefer to page 101 of our 2021 Sustainability Report.\n05.7.1 Our material issues\nOur assessment in 2021 identified 19 material issues which were prioritized as either having high or medium importance.\nTopics are ranked and presented in\na materiality matrix along two axes according to stakeholder views on their importance to society and to our business.\n\n\n 01 Introduction 02 Measuring and 03 Climate change 04 Strengthening and strategy managing sustainability related disclosure our foundation\n05.8 Independent Practitioner\u2019s Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Sustainability Information\n05 Our universal principles\nIn a limited assurance engagement\nthe assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained.\nThe assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner\u2019s judgment.\nWithin the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed amongst others the following assurance procedures and further activities:\n\u2022 Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement\n\u2022 Assessment of the process for conducting the materiality analysis in accordance with the GRI criteria\n\u2022 Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Report regarding the preparation process, the internal control system relating to this process and selected disclosures in the Report\n\u2022 Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the Report under consideration of the GRI-Criteria\nTo Allianz SE, Munich\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures in the sustainability report of Allianz SE, Munich (hereinafter \u201cthe Company\u201d), for the period from January 1, 2022\nto December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the \u201cReport\u201d).\nResponsibilities of the\nExecutive Directors\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the \u201cGRI-Criteria\u201d).\nThis responsibility of Company\u2019s executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate methods of sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures,\nwhich are reasonable in the circumstances.

Our aim is to prevent\ncompliance violations from the outset through compulsory training\nfor all employees and special training for leaders. The Corporate\nAudit department continuously monitors compliance with require-\nments. We regularly assess our performance in environmental\nprotection, health and safety as part of our Responsible Care\nManagement System. We realize our responsibility to behave in\naccordance with international and social standards largely in three\nways: through our Compliance Program, including our Code of\nConduct and compliance hotlines, through close dialog with stake-\nholders and through the global management process to respect\ninternational labor norms. We pursue sustainability-oriented supply\nchain management and expect our business partners to comply\nwith prevailing laws, regulations and internationally recognized\nprinciples. Here, too, we have established appropriate monitoring\nsystems.\nFor more information on human and labor rights, see page 109 onward\nFor more information on compliance, see page 179 onward\nFor more information on responsible procurement and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\nsee page 114 onward\nFor more information on the Responsible Care Management System, see page 123 onward\no other environmental objectives were reviewed in a three-step\nprocess. The first step involved a two-part analysis based on\nBASF\u2019s internal product databases:\n\u2013 The manufacture of products is analyzed with respect to the\nuse of critical substances in accordance with Annex C1 of the\nE.U. Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 to ensure\nsignificant pollution prevention or control according to the E.U.\ntaxonomy. This also includes use in the production process. An\nassessment of the \u201cessential use\u201d of the critical substances used\nin the sense of the opening clauses according to Annex C,\nletters f) and g) has not been performed. The E.U. Commission\nannounced further regulations on this in 2023.\n\u2013 Plastics in primary form are analyzed with respect to the share of\nrenewable raw materials in the product. They are only considered\nfurther if this share is at least 5% and thus potentially make a\nsubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation through\npartial or complete production from renewable raw materials.\nShares allocated using mass balance approaches (see page 121)\nare not taken into account here because their acceptance under\nthe E.U. taxonomy has not yet been definitively clarified. For this\nreason, BASF products based on chemically recycled raw mate-\nrials are not considered further in the assessment at present\neither. Mechanical recycling does not play any role for BASF here.\nIn the second step, it was assessed whether the potentially tax-\nonomy-aligned products make a substantial contribution to climate\nchange mitigation in accordance with the activity-specific criteria.\nAmong other things, the greenhouse gas emissions of European\nand non-European plants to produce soda ash, organic basic\nchemicals and nitric acid were compared with the average values of\nthe most efficient plants under the E.U. emissions trading system.\nFor the production of hydrogen, chlorine, ammonia and plastics in\nprimary form, the comparison was against activity-specific quantita-\ntive criteria, such as the energy or emission intensity of a product.\nThis was based on a digital solution developed by BASF to deter-\nmine product-specific carbon emissions (see page 140).\n1 Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals\n2 Protection of water and marine resources is taken as given at sites that do not use or treat water.\n3 A radius of 3 km around production sites was defined for the analysis of biodiversity-sensitive areas.\nFinally, in the third step of the process, it was assessed whether the\nproducts identified cause significant harm to the other environmental\nobjectives. This included an analysis of risks arising from climate\nchange using climate risk and vulnerability assessments. At sites\nwith material climate risk, the existence of adaptation solutions was\nadditionally analyzed and evaluated. The avoidance of significant\nharm to water and marine resources,2 biodiversity and ecosystems,3\nand pollution prevention and control were taken as given for produc-\ntion plants in Europe based on comprehensive and uniform regula-\ntory requirements and additionally ensured through data queries.\nThe conformity of non-European plants was assessed on a case-\nby-case basis. This was based on joint assessments by local and\ncentral experts using the evidence of local production requirements\nsubmitted.\nThe criteria for the minimum social safeguards as a further pillar\nof taxonomy alignment in accordance with Article 18 of the E.U.\nTaxonomy Regulation were reviewed for all activities across the\nBASF Group, independent of the step-by-step process for the\n\u201ccontribution to climate change mitigation\u201d and \u201charm to other\nenvironmental objectives\u201d criteria.\nThe recommendations of the E.U. Platform on Sustainable Finance\nof October 2022 on the four core topics of human rights (including\nlabor rights), corruption/bribery, taxation and fair competition were\ntaken into account here. Minimum social safeguards are to be\nensured by a systematic, integrated and risk-based approach\nto safeguarding our human rights due diligence obligations (see\npage 109), by global labor and social standards (see page 110), and\nby the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 115), among other things.\nTaxonomy-aligned turnover accounted for 0.4% of the total sales\nrevenue defined and reported in the BASF Group\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in 2022. The \u201cmanufacture of organic basic\nchemicals\u201d made the largest contribution (0.3%). Taxonomy-aligned\ncapital expenditures (including acquisitions and excluding goodwill\nin accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted for 0.5% of the\n96\ntotal investments reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe \u201cmanufacture of soda ash\u201d contributed significantly here with\n0.3%. Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures accounted for\n0.9% of total operating expenditures, with the largest contribution\nfrom the economic activity \u201cmanufacture of plastics in primary form\u201d\n(0.5%). It is not possible to provide information on changes\nin taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures and operating\nexpenditures as these are being reported for the first time in 2022.\nThe taxonomy-aligned figure is significantly lower than the tax-\nonomy-eligible figure due to various factors. Only a small proportion\nof plastics in primary form contain a share of renewable raw materials\nabove the threshold value. In many production processes, sub-\nstances that fall within Annex C1 are used to prevent or reduce\npollution. As a result, these processes are no longer taxonomy-\naligned, even if the substances are not released into the environment\n(for example, because they are exclusively used in a closed system\nin the production plant) and are used in accordance with existing\nchemicals legislation. This means, for example, that all production\nprocesses for the manufacture of battery materials must be\nassessed as not taxonomy-aligned. The proportion of taxonomy-\naligned activities is also reduced by the fact that many plants\nexceed the benchmarks used by the E.U. taxonomy, such as the\nE.U. emissions trading scheme. In addition, plants that are not\nsubject to emissions trading and thus cannot be assessed using the\nspecified criteria were generally classified as not taxonomy-aligned.\nFor more information on sales revenue, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from\npage 227 onward\nFor more information on investments, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfrom page 242 onward.\nGRI 2, 3, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 413\nSUPPLIERS BASF CUSTOMERS\nBASF acknowledges its responsibility to respect internationally recognized human rights.

The expert working group provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. In this way, we want to ensure that we approach our human rights responsibility holistically and that we can continually improve our performance.\nnternational labor and social standards\nOur aim of acting responsibly toward our employees is embedded in\nour global Code of Conduct through our voluntary commitment to\nrespecting international labor and social standards. This encom-\npasses internationally recognized labor norms as stipulated in the\nUnited Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD\nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declara-\ntion of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social\nPolicy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In order to\nmeet the requirement to comply with these standards worldwide,\nwe mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social\nstandards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including\ncompliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as\nwith employee representatives or international organizations) and\nthe BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms,\nwhich applies Group-wide. This guideline concretizes the topics in\nour global Code of Conduct under \u201cHuman rights, labor and social\nstandards\u201d as these relate to our employees.

We work to ensure that our partners meet their respective responsibilities.\nWe established a Human Rights Advisory Council in 2020 to integrate external expertise. Its members include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human rights topics helos us to better understand different perspectives and to deal more openly with critical situations.\nThe meetings held in 2022, which were chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer. were attended by representatives from the Corporate Compliance and Corporate Strategv & Sustainability departments as well as other experts from the operating divisions or procurement as required.

We use recognized assessments and audits to verify this. In 2022, we continued our work with our upstream supply chain, where we usually have no direct contractual relationships, less transparency and less influence. Here, we seek to increase our influence through collaboration with partners and stakeholders, and place importance on certifications such as the LBMA certificate for gold, the LPPM certificate for platinum group metals, and the Responsible Minerals Initiative's Responsible Minerals Assurance Process.\ne work together with partners, civil society and in cross-sector\ninitiatives.

These measures are also\nimportant against the background of new regulations, especially the\nGerman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCA). These include the\nappointment of BASF\u2019s Chief Human Rights Officer and the further\ndevelopment of our Policy Statement on Human Rights, including\nfurther explanations of our approach to human rights due diligence\nand priority risks for our company. Both of these measures were\napproved by the Board of Executive Directors in November 2022.\nTo strengthen due diligence in the supply chain, we have also\nenhanced and refined a range of measures, including supplier risk\nanalysis as well as preventive measures such as the systematic\nbusiness partner due diligence for new suppliers, our Supplier Code\nof Conduct, and the requirements to be embedded in suppliers\u2019\ncontracts. We continue to expect our suppliers to enforce our\nstandards at their suppliers and subcontractors, too. Furthermore,\nthe rights of third-party workers in high-risk countries will be even\nbetter protected in the future through additional due diligence steps.\nThese include risk-based controls and measures that promote\ntransparency and awareness of human rights issues.\nWe have also been able to analyze and confirm BASF\u2019s compliance\nwith the specific environmental treaties covered by the SCA\n(Minamata, Stockholm, Basel) in countries that have not yet ratified\nthese conventions. Promoting awareness of human rights was again a focus topic\nin 2022. Workshop programs on this were held in our operating\ndivisions. In addition, employees in all regions were informed about\nand sensitized to human rights topics through presentations and\ndiscussion formats for specific target groups.\nOur grievance mechanisms, which we already improved in 2021\nwith the introduction of a standardized global hotline and reporting\nsystem, were also used in 2022. A total of 151 human rights-related\ncomplaints were received by phone as well as by post and e-mail\n(2021: 206). All complaints were reviewed and forwarded to the\nrelevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appro-\npriate measures were taken. The 65 closed and justified cases were\nprimarily harassment cases, followed by cases of discrimination.\nOur grievance channels did not identify any instances of child labor\nor forced labor.\nWe report on our global targets, monitoring systems and measures\nto integrate human rights topics into our business activities in publi-\ncations such as this report and online.\nFor more information on our production standards, see page 125 onward\nSee basf.com/humanrights for more information on the Policy Statement on Human Rights and a\ncomprehensive report on the implementation of due diligence in accordance with the requirements\nof the National Action Plan developed by the German government, and in accordance with the\nU.N.

Again in\n2022, none of our audits identified any instances of forced labor,\nout at Nornickel\u2019s site in Polar, Russia, in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe results of these audits were discussed with Nornickel and\nfollow-up measures were evaluated. Nornickel continues to seek\nmembership in internationally recognized industry initiatives that\nprovide third-party verification of mining and responsible procurement\nstandards, such as IRMA or the International Council on Mining and\nMetals (ICMM). However, this is only possible to a limited extent in\nthe current environment.\nTogether for Sustainability (TfS)\nchild labor or dangerous work and overtime performed by persons\nSupplier development\nBASF is a founding member of Together for Sustainability. The\ninitiative was established in 2011 to improve sustainability in the\nsupply chain. The focus is on the standardization, simplification\nand mutual recognition of supplier audits and assessments.\nSuppliers are evaluated by independent experts either in on-site\naudits or online assessments. The latter are conducted by\nEcoVadis, a ratings agency specialized in sustainability\nevaluations. At the end of 2022, TfS had 40 members with a\ncombined procurement spend of around \u20ac400 billion. A total of\n378 audits and 8,386 online assessments were performed in\n2022. As a TfS member, BASF itself is assessed and in 2022\nwas again ranked among the top 1% companies worldwide in\nthe sustainable procurement category. BASF is involved in the\nfurther development of TfS, for example, in activities to standardize\nthe calculation of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in the\nsupply chain (see page 139).\nunder 18.\nWe maintained close dialog with our South African platinum supplier\nSibanye-Stillwater1 in 2022 on the results of the audit from 2020,\nthe implementation of the resulting action plan, and other relevant\ntopics. This includes working with stakeholders to take a unified\napproach to local community development. All the needs for\nadjustment identified in the 2020 audit had been addressed by the\nend of 2022. BASF and Sibanye-Stillwater have agreed that future\naudits will follow the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance\n(IRMA) mining standard. Sustainability topics are discussed on a\nquarterly basis. Sibanye-Stillwater is a member and supporter of the\nInternational Platinum Group Metals Association (IPA) sustainability\ninitiative that was co-founded by BASF. Measures include conducting\ncomprehensive sustainability audits and sharing factors for success.\nThe regular dialog with stakeholders continued in 2022. In addition,\nSibanye-Stillwater has directly involved relevant stakeholders in\nGermany and South Africa in its own stakeholder dialog.\nIn 2022, the war of aggression in Ukraine also impacted the\nbusiness relationship with our Russian raw materials supplier\nNornickel. This could not be continued to the extent planned. We\nnevertheless maintain regular dialog with Nornickel, are monitoring\nthe situation and events from a sustainability perspective, and are in\ncontact with civil society groups. Topics addressed include the\nfindings from the mining-specific TfS audits. TfS audits were carried\nIf supplier assessments identify deviations from standards, we ask\nsuppliers to develop and implement corrective measures within a\nreasonable time frame in a clearly defined follow-up process. We\nsupport them in their efforts. In South America, for example, over\n300 employees of suppliers participated in a webinar on compliance\nand human rights in the supply chain. Together with Mercedes-Benz,\nwe also organized a workshop in the region focusing on gender\nequality, which was attended by 22 logistics service providers. An\nimportant part of supplier development in 2022 was also the\nsustainability webinars held by TfS together with EcoVadis in various\nlanguages, with a total of over 1,900 participants. In addition, the\nnew TfS Academy online learning platform is aimed at buyers and\nsuppliers. It covers the entire spectrum of ESG topics. There are\ncurrently over 335 courses available in 10 different languages.\nWe review our suppliers\u2019 progress according to a defined time frame\nbased on the sustainability risk identified, or after five years at the\nlatest. In the case of serious violations of the standards defined in\nour Supplier Code of Conduct or international principles, we reserve\nthe right to impose commercial sanctions. These can go as far as\ntermination of the business relationship. In 2022, this happened in\none case.\nGood to know\n1 In 2012, an extended strike at a platinum mine in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police.

Ownership \nCorporate Governance Report\nGRI 2,3,405\nCorporate governance refers to the entire system for managing and supervising a company. This includes its organization, values,\ncorporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms. Effective and transparent\ncorporate governance ensures that BASF is managed and supervised responsibly with a focus on value creation and sustainability.\nIt fosters the confidence of our investors, the financial markets, our customers  and other business partners, employees, other\ngroups affiliated with our company (stakeholders) as well as the public in BASF\nThe fundamental elements of BAS SE's corporate governance system are: its two-tier management system, with a transparent and effective separation of company management and supervision between BASF's Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board; the equal representation of shareholders and employee representatives on the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders' rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\nBoard of Executive Directors\nAt a glance\n\u2022 Responsible for company management and represents\nBASF SE in business with third parties\n\u2022 Sets goals and strategic direction\n\u2022 Strictly separate from the Supervisory Board\nDirection and management by the Board of Executive\nDirectors\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for managing the company and represents BASF SE in business undertakings with third parties. BAS's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive Directors' activities and decides on its composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously\nbe a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors defines the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas, including the sustainability strategy. In doing so, the Board ensures that the risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental factors for our company as well as the ecological and societal impacts of BASF's activities are systematically identified and evaluated. In addition to long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy appropriately takes environmental and social objectives into account, too. The corporate planning defined on this basis comprises financial and sustainability-related goals.\nFurthermore, the Board of Executive Directors determines the company's internal organization and decides on the composition of management positions on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value and developing the company over the long term, taking into account environmental and social goals as well as economic targets. The Board's responsibilities include the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of BASF SE and reporting on the company's financial and nonfinancial performance as well as half-year and quarterly reporting. It must\nalso ensure that the company's activities comply with the applicable legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as internal corporate directives (compliance). This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management as well as embedding a company-wide compliance culture with undisputed standards.\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made and all important matters of the company are discussed at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors.\nBoard decisions are based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. The chair of the Board of Executive Directors leads the Board meetings. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors gives the casting vote.\nHowever, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors cannot enforce a decision against the Board of Executive Directors' majority vote. The chair of the Board also does not have the right to veto.\nOutside of matters that are assigned to the entire Board for consultation and decision-making, all members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their designated areas of responsibility.\nThe Board of Executive Directors can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual issues such as proposed material acquisition or divestiture prolects or to prepare decisions to be\nmade by the entire Board. These must include at least three\nmembers of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of\nimportant decisions, such as those on acquisitions, divestitures,\ninvestments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at\nthe level below the Board. Independently of the affected business\narea, these committees thoroughly assess the planned measures\nand evaluate the associated opportunities and risks. Based on this\ninformation, they report and make recommendations to the Board.\nThe Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board\nregularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important\nto the company with regard to planning, business development, risk\nsituation, risk management and compliance. Furthermore, the\nBoard of Executive Directors coordinates the company\u2019s strategic\norientation with the Supervisory Board.\nThe Statutes of BASF SE and the Supervisory Board have defined\ncertain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to\nobtain the Supervisory Board\u2019s approval prior to their conclusion.\nSuch cases that require approval include the acquisition and\ndisposal of enterprises and parts of enterprises, as well as the issue\nof bonds or comparable financial instruments. However, this is only\nnecessary if the acquisition or disposal price or the amount of the\nissue in an individual case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in the\nmost recent approved Consolidated Financial Statements of the\nBASF Group.\nCompetence profile, diversity concept and succession\nplanning for the Board of Executive Directors\nThe Supervisory Board works hand in hand with the Board of\nExecutive Directors to ensure long-term succession planning for the\ncomposition of the Board of Executive Directors.

There are neither different classes of shares\nnor shares with preferential voting rights.\nAppointment and dismissal of members of the Board of\nExecutive Directors\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Execu-\ntive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article 39 of\nthe SE Council Regulation, section 16 of the SE Implementation Act\nand sections 84 and 85 AktG as well as Article 7 of the Statutes of\nBASF SE. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the\nnumber of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least\ntwo), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors,\nand can nominate a chair, as well as one or more vice chairs. The\nmembers of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a\nmaximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is\nthree years. Reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory\nBoard can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if\nthere is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular,\na gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive\nDirectors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and\ndismissals according to its own best judgment.\nCompliance culture at BASF\nFor corporate compliance to be a success, there must be an active\nculture of living these values and commitments within the company.\nThe principles embedded in our Code of Conduct are established\nand recognized in our day-to-day business. We expect all employees\nto act in line with these principles. Our leaders play a key role here \u2013\nthey serve as an example of and communicate our values and\nculture both internally and externally. That is why special workshops\non integrity as a leadership task were again held in 2022 for newly\nappointed senior executives.\nMonitoring adherence to our compliance principles\nBASF\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the\nChairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the\nfurther development of our global compliance organization and our\nCompliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this\ntask by the Corporate Compliance department and more than\n100 compliance officers worldwide in the regions and countries as\nwell as in the divisions, service units and in the Corporate Center.\nMaterial compliance topics are regularly discussed in the compliance\ncommittees established at global and regional level. The compliance\norganization reports to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee in\nat least one of its meetings each year on the status of the Compliance\nProgram as well as any major developments. In the event of signifi-\ncant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the\nBoard of Executive Directors.\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly\nseek guidance if in doubt. They can consult their supervisors,\nspecialist departments, such as the Legal department, and company\ncompliance officers. The internal platform and the corresponding\napp also help employees to access advice by enabling direct\ncontact. In addition, our employees can contact our compliance\nhotline \u2013 including anonymously \u2013 to report potential violations of\nlaws or company guidelines. An independent external company has\nbeen contracted to manage this global hotline so that reported\ncases are recorded and processed worldwide through one system.\nThe central point of contact is a website that informs all employees\nworldwide about the hotline and the grievance procedure in their\nnational language. In addition to local phone numbers, the website\nalso offers an online contact option, which is available via PC or\nsmartphone. The website is also available to the public. Each\nconcern is documented according to specific criteria, properly\ninvestigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered\nas quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as\nany measures taken are documented accordingly and included in\ninternal reports.\nIn 2022, 453 reports were received by our external hotlines (2021:\n277). The information received related to all categories of our Code\nof Conduct, including respect in the workplace, corruption, handling\nof company property and environmental, health and safety issues.\nWe carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that\ncame to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures\non a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved\ncontrol mechanisms, additional informational and training measures,\nclarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as\nwell as disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified\ncases related to violations of our principles on respect in the work-\nplace and personal misconduct in connection with the protection of\ncompany property or inappropriate handling of conflicts of interests.\nIn such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance\nwith uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for damages\nwhere there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2022, violations\nof our Code of Conduct led to termination of employment in a total\nof 34 cases (2021: 32). This relates to diverse employee groups,\nincluding executives.\nBASF\u2019s Corporate Audit department monitors adherence to\ncompliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance\nviolations could occur. They check that employees uphold regu-\nlations and make sure that the established processes, procedures\nand monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize\npotential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2022,\n47 audits of this kind were performed Group-wide (2021: 77). Our\n180\ncompliance management system itself is also regularly audited by\nthe internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in December\n2022. Overall, the audit results speak for the effectiveness of the\ncompliance management system. As part of the comprehensive\naction plan developed last year for the continuous, systematic\noptimization of our compliance management system, we worked on\nstrengthening key processes in 2022 and described the principles,\ncore processes and roles in our system in detail in a revised\ninternal policy, Compliance Management System (CMS), which\nwas approved by the Board of Executive Directors in August 2022.\nA particular focus of our compliance activities in 2022 was the\nfurther development of our internal systems and processes in light\nof changes to supply chain law, including the German Supply Chain\nDue Diligence Act (SCA) (see page 111).\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance\nrisks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due\nDiligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based\nanalysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are\nnot prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a\nbusiness relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code\nof Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance standards, among\nother requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also\ncheck whether persons, companies or organizations appear on\nsanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities and whether there\nare business processes with business partners from or in countries\nunder embargo. One focus of our activities in 2022 was on the\ncontinuous monitoring and implementation of the dynamically evolv-\ning sanctions law requirements in light of the war in Ukraine.\nWe support the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and\nHuman Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal\nguidelines and processes in keeping with these principles. For\nexample, there is an internal guideline to respect international\nlabor and social standards that is applicable throughout the\nGroup. Outside of our company, too, we support respect for human\nrights and the fight against corruption. We are a founding member\nof the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of Transparency\nBASF Report 2022 Corporate Governance \u2013 Compliance 181\nInternational Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption\nInitiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in the\nimplementation of these organizations\u2019 objectives.\nWe are committed to adhering to uniformly high standards and\nintegrity regarding tax-related issues, as embedded in BASF\u2019s Code\nof Conduct and corporate values. To aid in the achievement of the\nU.N. SDGs and to meet our own standards for the creation of\neconomic and social value, we contribute to public finances in\naccordance with legal requirements and our corporate values. In\n2020, we developed and published the BASF tax principles, which\nare binding for all Group entities.\nFor more information on the Supplier Code of Conduct and supplier assessments,\nsee page 114 onward\nFor more information on the Code of Conduct, see basf.com/code-of-conduct\nFor more information on human rights and labor and social standards, see\nbasf.com/human_rights\nFor more information on tax principles, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\nBASF's Compliance Program is based on our corporate values and voluntary commitments, as well as international standards. It describes our commitment to responsible conduct and expectations around how all BAS employees interact with business partners, officials, coworkers and the community. At the core of our Compliance Program is the global, standardized Code of Conduct. All employees and leaders are obligated to adhere to its guidelines, which cover topics ranging from corruption and antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy.\nThe online version of our Code of Conduct is aimed at our emplovees and also offers user-friendly features such as case studies, FAQs and additional references. The internal online platform and the corresponding app provide our employees worldwide with up-to-date content such as videos and links to specialist units and guidelines as well as direct contact to subject specialists.\nOther binding governance documents (policies, corporate require-ments) are published on a digital platform that offers our employees an effective search function and context-based links to further information. The managing directors of BAS Group companies can find important information and assistance on ensuring compliance in their Group companies on an intranet page set up especially for them.\nAbiding by compliance standards is the foundation of responsible leadership. This has also been embedded in our values. We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a key role in securing our company's long-term success. Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset.\nWe perform a systematic risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance violations, including corruption risks. These are conducted at divisional and Group company level. The regular compliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are another source of information for the systematic identification of risks. These risks are documented in the relevant risk or audit report.\nThe same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the time frame for their implementation.\nOne key element in violation prevention is compulsory training and workshops held as classroom or online courses. All employees are required within a prescribed time frame to take part in basic training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations. Newly appointed senior executives also receive special training on leading with integrity. Course materials and formats are constantly updated, taking into account the specific risks of individual target groups and business areas. In total, more than 30,000 participants worldwide received over 50,000 hours of compliance training in 2022.\nThe image is an infographic titled \"Compliance,\" which describes the company's Compliance Program and Code of Conduct. Here is a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Compliance\nThe main aim of the Group-wide Compliance Program is to ensure adherence to legal regulations, the company\u2019s internal guidelines, and ethical business practices.

This is why we embrace bold ideas and give them\nspace to grow. We act with optimism and inspire one another.\n\u2013 O \u2013 open: We value diversity, in people, opinions and experience.\nThis is why we foster feedback based on honesty, respect and\nmutual trust.

We seize opportunities and think ahead. We\ntake ownership and embrace personal accountability.\nOur standards are based on, and in some cases, exceed existing\nlaws and regulations and take internationally recognized principles\ninto account. We respect and promote:\n\u2013 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two U.N.\nHuman Rights Covenants\n\u2013 The 10 principles of the U.N.

Our aim is to prevent\ncompliance violations from the outset through compulsory training\nfor all employees and special training for leaders. The Corporate\nAudit department continuously monitors compliance with require-\nments. We regularly assess our performance in environmental\nprotection, health and safety as part of our Responsible Care\nManagement System. We realize our responsibility to behave in\naccordance with international and social standards largely in three\nways: through our Compliance Program, including our Code of\nConduct and compliance hotlines, through close dialog with stake-\nholders and through the global management process to respect\ninternational labor norms. We pursue sustainability-oriented supply\nchain management and expect our business partners to comply\nwith prevailing laws, regulations and internationally recognized\nprinciples. Here, too, we have established appropriate monitoring\nsystems.\nFor more information on human and labor rights, see page 109 onward\nFor more information on compliance, see page 179 onward\nFor more information on responsible procurement and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\nsee page 114 onward\nFor more information on the Responsible Care Management System, see page 123 onward\no other environmental objectives were reviewed in a three-step\nprocess. The first step involved a two-part analysis based on\nBASF\u2019s internal product databases:\n\u2013 The manufacture of products is analyzed with respect to the\nuse of critical substances in accordance with Annex C1 of the\nE.U. Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 to ensure\nsignificant pollution prevention or control according to the E.U.\ntaxonomy. This also includes use in the production process. An\nassessment of the \u201cessential use\u201d of the critical substances used\nin the sense of the opening clauses according to Annex C,\nletters f) and g) has not been performed. The E.U. Commission\nannounced further regulations on this in 2023.\n\u2013 Plastics in primary form are analyzed with respect to the share of\nrenewable raw materials in the product. They are only considered\nfurther if this share is at least 5% and thus potentially make a\nsubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation through\npartial or complete production from renewable raw materials.\nShares allocated using mass balance approaches (see page 121)\nare not taken into account here because their acceptance under\nthe E.U. taxonomy has not yet been definitively clarified. For this\nreason, BASF products based on chemically recycled raw mate-\nrials are not considered further in the assessment at present\neither. Mechanical recycling does not play any role for BASF here.\nIn the second step, it was assessed whether the potentially tax-\nonomy-aligned products make a substantial contribution to climate\nchange mitigation in accordance with the activity-specific criteria.\nAmong other things, the greenhouse gas emissions of European\nand non-European plants to produce soda ash, organic basic\nchemicals and nitric acid were compared with the average values of\nthe most efficient plants under the E.U. emissions trading system.\nFor the production of hydrogen, chlorine, ammonia and plastics in\nprimary form, the comparison was against activity-specific quantita-\ntive criteria, such as the energy or emission intensity of a product.\nThis was based on a digital solution developed by BASF to deter-\nmine product-specific carbon emissions (see page 140).\n1 Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals\n2 Protection of water and marine resources is taken as given at sites that do not use or treat water.\n3 A radius of 3 km around production sites was defined for the analysis of biodiversity-sensitive areas.\nFinally, in the third step of the process, it was assessed whether the\nproducts identified cause significant harm to the other environmental\nobjectives. This included an analysis of risks arising from climate\nchange using climate risk and vulnerability assessments. At sites\nwith material climate risk, the existence of adaptation solutions was\nadditionally analyzed and evaluated. The avoidance of significant\nharm to water and marine resources,2 biodiversity and ecosystems,3\nand pollution prevention and control were taken as given for produc-\ntion plants in Europe based on comprehensive and uniform regula-\ntory requirements and additionally ensured through data queries.\nThe conformity of non-European plants was assessed on a case-\nby-case basis. This was based on joint assessments by local and\ncentral experts using the evidence of local production requirements\nsubmitted.\nThe criteria for the minimum social safeguards as a further pillar\nof taxonomy alignment in accordance with Article 18 of the E.U.\nTaxonomy Regulation were reviewed for all activities across the\nBASF Group, independent of the step-by-step process for the\n\u201ccontribution to climate change mitigation\u201d and \u201charm to other\nenvironmental objectives\u201d criteria.\nThe recommendations of the E.U. Platform on Sustainable Finance\nof October 2022 on the four core topics of human rights (including\nlabor rights), corruption/bribery, taxation and fair competition were\ntaken into account here. Minimum social safeguards are to be\nensured by a systematic, integrated and risk-based approach\nto safeguarding our human rights due diligence obligations (see\npage 109), by global labor and social standards (see page 110), and\nby the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 115), among other things.\nTaxonomy-aligned turnover accounted for 0.4% of the total sales\nrevenue defined and reported in the BASF Group\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in 2022. The \u201cmanufacture of organic basic\nchemicals\u201d made the largest contribution (0.3%). Taxonomy-aligned\ncapital expenditures (including acquisitions and excluding goodwill\nin accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted for 0.5% of the\n96\ntotal investments reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe \u201cmanufacture of soda ash\u201d contributed significantly here with\n0.3%. Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures accounted for\n0.9% of total operating expenditures, with the largest contribution\nfrom the economic activity \u201cmanufacture of plastics in primary form\u201d\n(0.5%). It is not possible to provide information on changes\nin taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures and operating\nexpenditures as these are being reported for the first time in 2022.\nThe taxonomy-aligned figure is significantly lower than the tax-\nonomy-eligible figure due to various factors. Only a small proportion\nof plastics in primary form contain a share of renewable raw materials\nabove the threshold value. In many production processes, sub-\nstances that fall within Annex C1 are used to prevent or reduce\npollution. As a result, these processes are no longer taxonomy-\naligned, even if the substances are not released into the environment\n(for example, because they are exclusively used in a closed system\nin the production plant) and are used in accordance with existing\nchemicals legislation. This means, for example, that all production\nprocesses for the manufacture of battery materials must be\nassessed as not taxonomy-aligned. The proportion of taxonomy-\naligned activities is also reduced by the fact that many plants\nexceed the benchmarks used by the E.U. taxonomy, such as the\nE.U. emissions trading scheme. In addition, plants that are not\nsubject to emissions trading and thus cannot be assessed using the\nspecified criteria were generally classified as not taxonomy-aligned.\nFor more information on sales revenue, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from\npage 227 onward\nFor more information on investments, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfrom page 242 onward.\nGRI 2, 3, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 413\nSUPPLIERS BASF CUSTOMERS\nBASF acknowledges its responsibility to respect internationally recognized human rights.

The expert working group provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. In this way, we want to ensure that we approach our human rights responsibility holistically and that we can continually improve our performance.\nnternational labor and social standards\nOur aim of acting responsibly toward our employees is embedded in\nour global Code of Conduct through our voluntary commitment to\nrespecting international labor and social standards.

In order to\nmeet the requirement to comply with these standards worldwide,\nwe mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social\nstandards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including\ncompliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as\nwith employee representatives or international organizations) and\nthe BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms,\nwhich applies Group-wide. This guideline concretizes the topics in\nour global Code of Conduct under \u201cHuman rights, labor and social\nstandards\u201d as these relate to our employees.

We work to ensure that our partners meet their respective responsibilities.\nWe established a Human Rights Advisory Council in 2020 to integrate external expertise. Its members include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human rights topics helos us to better understand different perspectives and to deal more openly with critical situations.\nThe meetings held in 2022, which were chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer. were attended by representatives from the Corporate Compliance and Corporate Strategv & Sustainability departments as well as other experts from the operating divisions or procurement as required.

We use recognized assessments and audits to verify this. In 2022, we continued our work with our upstream supply chain, where we usually have no direct contractual relationships, less transparency and less influence.

In 2022,\nBASF, Syngenta and Arisa also worked together on a multi-stake-\nholder initiative in the vegetable seeds business in India.

These measures are also\nimportant against the background of new regulations, especially the\nGerman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCA). These include the\nappointment of BASF\u2019s Chief Human Rights Officer and the further\ndevelopment of our Policy Statement on Human Rights, including\nfurther explanations of our approach to human rights due diligence\nand priority risks for our company. Both of these measures were\napproved by the Board of Executive Directors in November 2022.\nTo strengthen due diligence in the supply chain, we have also\nenhanced and refined a range of measures, including supplier risk\nanalysis as well as preventive measures such as the systematic\nbusiness partner due diligence for new suppliers, our Supplier Code\nof Conduct, and the requirements to be embedded in suppliers\u2019\ncontracts. We continue to expect our suppliers to enforce our\nstandards at their suppliers and subcontractors, too. Furthermore,\nthe rights of third-party workers in high-risk countries will be even\nbetter protected in the future through additional due diligence steps.\nThese include risk-based controls and measures that promote\ntransparency and awareness of human rights issues.\nWe have also been able to analyze and confirm BASF\u2019s compliance\nwith the specific environmental treaties covered by the SCA\n(Minamata, Stockholm, Basel) in countries that have not yet ratified\nthese conventions. Promoting awareness of human rights was again a focus topic\nin 2022. Workshop programs on this were held in our operating\ndivisions. In addition, employees in all regions were informed about\nand sensitized to human rights topics through presentations and\ndiscussion formats for specific target groups.\nOur grievance mechanisms, which we already improved in 2021\nwith the introduction of a standardized global hotline and reporting\nsystem, were also used in 2022. A total of 151 human rights-related\ncomplaints were received by phone as well as by post and e-mail\n(2021: 206). All complaints were reviewed and forwarded to the\nrelevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appro-\npriate measures were taken.

BAS's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive Directors' activities and decides on its composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously\nbe a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors defines the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas, including the sustainability strategy. In doing so, the Board ensures that the risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental factors for our company as well as the ecological and societal impacts of BASF's activities are systematically identified and evaluated. In addition to long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy appropriately takes environmental and social objectives into account, too. The corporate planning defined on this basis comprises financial and sustainability-related goals.\nFurthermore, the Board of Executive Directors determines the company's internal organization and decides on the composition of management positions on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value and developing the company over the long term, taking into account environmental and social goals as well as economic targets. The Board's responsibilities include the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of BASF SE and reporting on the company's financial and nonfinancial performance as well as half-year and quarterly reporting. It must\nalso ensure that the company's activities comply with the applicable legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as internal corporate directives (compliance). This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management as well as embedding a company-wide compliance culture with undisputed standards.\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made and all important matters of the company are discussed at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors.\nBoard decisions are based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. The chair of the Board of Executive Directors leads the Board meetings. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors gives the casting vote.\nHowever, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors cannot enforce a decision against the Board of Executive Directors' majority vote. The chair of the Board also does not have the right to veto.\nOutside of matters that are assigned to the entire Board for consultation and decision-making, all members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their designated areas of responsibility.\nThe Board of Executive Directors can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual issues such as proposed material acquisition or divestiture prolects or to prepare decisions to be\nmade by the entire Board. These must include at least three\nmembers of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of\nimportant decisions, such as those on acquisitions, divestitures,\ninvestments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at\nthe level below the Board. Independently of the affected business\narea, these committees thoroughly assess the planned measures\nand evaluate the associated opportunities and risks. Based on this\ninformation, they report and make recommendations to the Board.\nThe Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board\nregularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important\nto the company with regard to planning, business development, risk\nsituation, risk management and compliance.

All of BASF SE\u2019s shares\nare registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have themselves\nentered with their shares into the company share register and to\nprovide the information necessary for registration in the share regis-\nter according to the German Stock Corporation Act. There are no\nregistration restrictions and there is no limit to the number of shares\nthat can be registered to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in\nthe share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed share-\nholders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting either personally, through a representative of their choice or\nthrough a company-appointed proxy authorized by the shareholders\nto vote according to their instructions. Individual instructions are only\nforwarded to the company on the morning of the day of the Annual\nShareholders\u2019 Meeting. Voting rights can be exercised according to\nshareholders\u2019 instructions by company-appointed proxies until the\nbeginning of the voting process during the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes\na shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully\nimplemented the principle of \u201cone share, one vote.\u201d All shareholders\nentered in the share register are entitled to participate in the Annual\nShareholders\u2019 Meetings, to have their say concerning any item on\nthe agenda and to request information about company issues\ninsofar as this is necessary to make an informed judgment about the\nitem on the agenda under discussion. Registered shareholders are\nalso entitled to file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions\nmade by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at\nthe Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting and to contest resolutions of the\nMeeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in court.\nShareholders who hold at least \u20ac500,000 of the company\u2019s share\ncapital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, are furthermore\nentitled to request that additional items be added to the agenda of\nthe Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\nGiven the particular circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the\n2022 Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting was again held as a virtual\nevent without the physical presence of shareholders in accordance\nwith the specific legal framework of the statutory provisions on\nthe holding of a virtual Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting pursuant to\nArticle 2 Section 1(1) and (2) of the COVID-19 Act in the version\namended by the Gesetz zur weiteren Verk\u00fcrzung des Restschuld-\nbefreiungsverfahrens und zur Anpassung pandemiebedingter\nVorschriften im Gesellschafts-, Genossenschafts-, Vereins- und\nStiftungsrecht sowie im Miet- und Pachtrecht [\u201cAct to further shorten\nthe residual debt discharge process and to adapt pandemic-related\nprovisions in corporate, cooperative, association and foundation\nlegislation as well as in tenancy and lease legislation\u201d] of Decem-\nber 22, 2020. To ensure legally compliant execution of this special\nAnnual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting format, whereby shareholders\nparticipated solely via electronic communication, some of the\naforementioned shareholder rights and options for action were\nlimited or handled in an exceptional manner at this virtual meeting.\nIn contrast, the 2023 Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting is planned to\nbe held again as an in-person meeting, i.e., with the shareholders\nphysically present at the meeting venue.\nImplementation of the German Corporate\nGovernance Code (GCGC)\nBASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on\nsustainably increasing the value of the company. BASF SE follows\nall of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance\nCode in the version dated April 28, 2022 (Code 2022), the version in\nforce at the time of submitting the Declaration of Conformity on\nDecember 15, 2022. Until then, BASF has complied with all recom-\nmendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the\nversion dated December 16, 2019 (Code 2020). In the same\nmanner, BASF follows all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the\nGerman Corporate Governance Code.\nThe joint Declaration of Conformity 2022 by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of\nBASF SE is rendered on page 193\nFor more information on the Declaration of Conformity 2022, the implementation of the Code\u2019s\nsuggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance. Disclosures according to section 315a of the\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory\nreport of the Board of Executive Directors\naccording to section 176(1) sentence 1 of the\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\nShare capital and shares\nAs of December 31, 2022, BASF SE\u2019s subscribed capital was\n\u20ac1,144,134,309.12 after the redemption of 24,623,765 repurchased\nown company shares in December 2022 (December 31, 2021:\n\u20ac1,175,652,728.23), divided into 893,854,929 registered shares\nwith no par value (December 31, 2021: 918,478,694). Each share\nentitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\nRestrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The\nsame rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes,\nshareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates (issuance\nof share certificates). There are neither different classes of shares\nnor shares with preferential voting rights.\nAppointment and dismissal of members of the Board of\nExecutive Directors\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Execu-\ntive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article 39 of\nthe SE Council Regulation, section 16 of the SE Implementation Act\nand sections 84 and 85 AktG as well as Article 7 of the Statutes of\nBASF SE. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the\nnumber of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least\ntwo), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors,\nand can nominate a chair, as well as one or more vice chairs. The\nmembers of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a\nmaximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is\nthree years. Reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory\nBoard can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if\nthere is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular,\na gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive\nDirectors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and\ndismissals according to its own best judgment.\nCompliance culture at BASF\nFor corporate compliance to be a success, there must be an active\nculture of living these values and commitments within the company.\nThe principles embedded in our Code of Conduct are established\nand recognized in our day-to-day business. We expect all employees\nto act in line with these principles. Our leaders play a key role here \u2013\nthey serve as an example of and communicate our values and\nculture both internally and externally. That is why special workshops\non integrity as a leadership task were again held in 2022 for newly\nappointed senior executives.\nMonitoring adherence to our compliance principles\nBASF\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the\nChairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the\nfurther development of our global compliance organization and our\nCompliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this\ntask by the Corporate Compliance department and more than\n100 compliance officers worldwide in the regions and countries as\nwell as in the divisions, service units and in the Corporate Center.\nMaterial compliance topics are regularly discussed in the compliance\ncommittees established at global and regional level. The compliance\norganization reports to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee in\nat least one of its meetings each year on the status of the Compliance\nProgram as well as any major developments. In the event of signifi-\ncant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the\nBoard of Executive Directors.\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly\nseek guidance if in doubt. They can consult their supervisors,\nspecialist departments, such as the Legal department, and company\ncompliance officers. The internal platform and the corresponding\napp also help employees to access advice by enabling direct\ncontact. In addition, our employees can contact our compliance\nhotline \u2013 including anonymously \u2013 to report potential violations of\nlaws or company guidelines. An independent external company has\nbeen contracted to manage this global hotline so that reported\ncases are recorded and processed worldwide through one system.\nThe central point of contact is a website that informs all employees\nworldwide about the hotline and the grievance procedure in their\nnational language. In addition to local phone numbers, the website\nalso offers an online contact option, which is available via PC or\nsmartphone. The website is also available to the public. Each\nconcern is documented according to specific criteria, properly\ninvestigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered\nas quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as\nany measures taken are documented accordingly and included in\ninternal reports.\nIn 2022, 453 reports were received by our external hotlines (2021:\n277). The information received related to all categories of our Code\nof Conduct, including respect in the workplace, corruption, handling\nof company property and environmental, health and safety issues.\nWe carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that\ncame to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures\non a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved\ncontrol mechanisms, additional informational and training measures,\nclarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as\nwell as disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified\ncases related to violations of our principles on respect in the work-\nplace and personal misconduct in connection with the protection of\ncompany property or inappropriate handling of conflicts of interests.\nIn such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance\nwith uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for damages\nwhere there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2022, violations\nof our Code of Conduct led to termination of employment in a total\nof 34 cases (2021: 32). This relates to diverse employee groups,\nincluding executives.\nBASF\u2019s Corporate Audit department monitors adherence to\ncompliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance\nviolations could occur. They check that employees uphold regu-\nlations and make sure that the established processes, procedures\nand monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize\npotential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2022,\n47 audits of this kind were performed Group-wide (2021: 77). Our\n180\ncompliance management system itself is also regularly audited by\nthe internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in December\n2022. Overall, the audit results speak for the effectiveness of the\ncompliance management system. As part of the comprehensive\naction plan developed last year for the continuous, systematic\noptimization of our compliance management system, we worked on\nstrengthening key processes in 2022 and described the principles,\ncore processes and roles in our system in detail in a revised\ninternal policy, Compliance Management System (CMS), which\nwas approved by the Board of Executive Directors in August 2022.\nA particular focus of our compliance activities in 2022 was the\nfurther development of our internal systems and processes in light\nof changes to supply chain law, including the German Supply Chain\nDue Diligence Act (SCA) (see page 111).\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance\nrisks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due\nDiligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based\nanalysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are\nnot prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a\nbusiness relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code\nof Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance standards, among\nother requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also\ncheck whether persons, companies or organizations appear on\nsanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities and whether there\nare business processes with business partners from or in countries\nunder embargo. One focus of our activities in 2022 was on the\ncontinuous monitoring and implementation of the dynamically evolv-\ning sanctions law requirements in light of the war in Ukraine.\nWe support the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and\nHuman Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal\nguidelines and processes in keeping with these principles. For\nexample, there is an internal guideline to respect international\nlabor and social standards that is applicable throughout the\nGroup. Outside of our company, too, we support respect for human\nrights and the fight against corruption. We are a founding member\nof the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of Transparency\nBASF Report 2022 Corporate Governance \u2013 Compliance 181\nInternational Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption\nInitiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in the\nimplementation of these organizations\u2019 objectives.\nWe are committed to adhering to uniformly high standards and\nintegrity regarding tax-related issues, as embedded in BASF\u2019s Code\nof Conduct and corporate values. To aid in the achievement of the\nU.N. SDGs and to meet our own standards for the creation of\neconomic and social value, we contribute to public finances in\naccordance with legal requirements and our corporate values. In\n2020, we developed and published the BASF tax principles, which\nare binding for all Group entities.\nFor more information on the Supplier Code of Conduct and supplier assessments,\nsee page 114 onward\nFor more information on the Code of Conduct, see basf.com/code-of-conduct\nFor more information on human rights and labor and social standards, see\nbasf.com/human_rights\nFor more information on tax principles, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\nBASF's Compliance Program is based on our corporate values and voluntary commitments, as well as international standards. It describes our commitment to responsible conduct and expectations around how all BAS employees interact with business partners, officials, coworkers and the community. At the core of our Compliance Program is the global, standardized Code of Conduct. All employees and leaders are obligated to adhere to its guidelines, which cover topics ranging from corruption and antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy.\nThe online version of our Code of Conduct is aimed at our emplovees and also offers user-friendly features such as case studies, FAQs and additional references. The internal online platform and the corresponding app provide our employees worldwide with up-to-date content such as videos and links to specialist units and guidelines as well as direct contact to subject specialists.\nOther binding governance documents (policies, corporate require-ments) are published on a digital platform that offers our employees an effective search function and context-based links to further information. The managing directors of BAS Group companies can find important information and assistance on ensuring compliance in their Group companies on an intranet page set up especially for them.\nAbiding by compliance standards is the foundation of responsible leadership. This has also been embedded in our values. We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a key role in securing our company's long-term success. Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset.\nWe perform a systematic risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance violations, including corruption risks. These are conducted at divisional and Group company level. The regular compliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are another source of information for the systematic identification of risks. These risks are documented in the relevant risk or audit report.\nThe same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the time frame for their implementation.\nOne key element in violation prevention is compulsory training and workshops held as classroom or online courses. All employees are required within a prescribed time frame to take part in basic training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations. Newly appointed senior executives also receive special training on leading with integrity. Course materials and formats are constantly updated, taking into account the specific risks of individual target groups and business areas. In total, more than 30,000 participants worldwide received over 50,000 hours of compliance training in 2022.\nThe image is an infographic titled \"Compliance,\" which describes the company's Compliance Program and Code of Conduct. Here is a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Compliance\nThe main aim of the Group-wide Compliance Program is to ensure adherence to legal regulations, the company\u2019s internal guidelines, and ethical business practices. The Code of Conduct embeds these mandatory standards into employees\u2019 day-to-day business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are expressly obligated to follow these principles.\n\n#### At a Glance\n- **>30,000 participants in compliance training**\n- **47 internal audits on adherence to our compliance standards**\n\n#### Key Components\n- **Code of Conduct:** Central to the Compliance Program\n- **Systematic development:** Continuous improvement of the compliance management system\n\n#### Compliance Focus Areas\n\n1. **We Care**\n   - Our Code of Conduct\n   - How We Make Decisions\n   - We Always Speak Up\n   - We Lead Integrity\n\n2. **We Earn Trust**\n   - Anti-Corruption\n   - Trade Control\n   - Anti-Money Laundering\n\n3. **We Play Fair**\n   - Antitrust Laws\n   - Gifts and Entertainment\n   - Conflicts of Interest\n\n4. **We Respect**\n   - Human Rights, Labor and Social Standards\n   - Environmental Protection, Health and Safety\n\n5. **We Protect**\n   - Sensitive Company Information\n   - Personal Data\n   - Digital Responsibility\n   - Company Property\n   - Accurate Books and Records\n\nThe infographic emphasizes the company's commitment to maintaining high standards of compliance through extensive training, regular audits, and a robust Code of Conduct.

They define how we want\nto work together \u2013 as a team, with our customers and our partners:\n\u2013 C \u2013 creative: We make great products and solutions for our\ncustomers. This is why we embrace bold ideas and give them\nspace to grow. We act with optimism and inspire one another.\n\u2013 O \u2013 open: We value diversity, in people, opinions and experience.\nThis is why we foster feedback based on honesty, respect and\nmutual trust. We learn from setbacks.\n\u2013 R \u2013 responsible: We value the health and safety of people above\nall else. We make sustainability part of every decision. We are\ncommitted to strict compliance and environmental standards.\n\u2013 E \u2013 entrepreneurial: We focus on our customers, as individuals\nand as a company. We seize opportunities and think ahead. We\ntake ownership and embrace personal accountability.\nOur standards are based on, and in some cases, exceed existing\nlaws and regulations and take internationally recognized principles\ninto account. We respect and promote:\n\u2013 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two U.N.\nHuman Rights Covenants\n\u2013 The 10 principles of the U.N.

Our aim is to prevent\ncompliance violations from the outset through compulsory training\nfor all employees and special training for leaders. The Corporate\nAudit department continuously monitors compliance with require-\nments. We regularly assess our performance in environmental\nprotection, health and safety as part of our Responsible Care\nManagement System. We realize our responsibility to behave in\naccordance with international and social standards largely in three\nways: through our Compliance Program, including our Code of\nConduct and compliance hotlines, through close dialog with stake-\nholders and through the global management process to respect\ninternational labor norms. We pursue sustainability-oriented supply\nchain management and expect our business partners to comply\nwith prevailing laws, regulations and internationally recognized\nprinciples. Here, too, we have established appropriate monitoring\nsystems.\nFor more information on human and labor rights, see page 109 onward\nFor more information on compliance, see page 179 onward\nFor more information on responsible procurement and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\nsee page 114 onward\nFor more information on the Responsible Care Management System, see page 123 onward\no other environmental objectives were reviewed in a three-step\nprocess. The first step involved a two-part analysis based on\nBASF\u2019s internal product databases:\n\u2013 The manufacture of products is analyzed with respect to the\nuse of critical substances in accordance with Annex C1 of the\nE.U. Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 to ensure\nsignificant pollution prevention or control according to the E.U.\ntaxonomy. This also includes use in the production process. An\nassessment of the \u201cessential use\u201d of the critical substances used\nin the sense of the opening clauses according to Annex C,\nletters f) and g) has not been performed. The E.U. Commission\nannounced further regulations on this in 2023.\n\u2013 Plastics in primary form are analyzed with respect to the share of\nrenewable raw materials in the product.

For this\nreason, BASF products based on chemically recycled raw mate-\nrials are not considered further in the assessment at present\neither. Mechanical recycling does not play any role for BASF here.\nIn the second step, it was assessed whether the potentially tax-\nonomy-aligned products make a substantial contribution to climate\nchange mitigation in accordance with the activity-specific criteria.\nAmong other things, the greenhouse gas emissions of European\nand non-European plants to produce soda ash, organic basic\nchemicals and nitric acid were compared with the average values of\nthe most efficient plants under the E.U. emissions trading system.\nFor the production of hydrogen, chlorine, ammonia and plastics in\nprimary form, the comparison was against activity-specific quantita-\ntive criteria, such as the energy or emission intensity of a product.\nThis was based on a digital solution developed by BASF to deter-\nmine product-specific carbon emissions (see page 140).\n1 Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals\n2 Protection of water and marine resources is taken as given at sites that do not use or treat water.\n3 A radius of 3 km around production sites was defined for the analysis of biodiversity-sensitive areas.\nFinally, in the third step of the process, it was assessed whether the\nproducts identified cause significant harm to the other environmental\nobjectives. This included an analysis of risks arising from climate\nchange using climate risk and vulnerability assessments. At sites\nwith material climate risk, the existence of adaptation solutions was\nadditionally analyzed and evaluated. The avoidance of significant\nharm to water and marine resources,2 biodiversity and ecosystems,3\nand pollution prevention and control were taken as given for produc-\ntion plants in Europe based on comprehensive and uniform regula-\ntory requirements and additionally ensured through data queries.\nThe conformity of non-European plants was assessed on a case-\nby-case basis. This was based on joint assessments by local and\ncentral experts using the evidence of local production requirements\nsubmitted.\nThe criteria for the minimum social safeguards as a further pillar\nof taxonomy alignment in accordance with Article 18 of the E.U.\nTaxonomy Regulation were reviewed for all activities across the\nBASF Group, independent of the step-by-step process for the\n\u201ccontribution to climate change mitigation\u201d and \u201charm to other\nenvironmental objectives\u201d criteria.\nThe recommendations of the E.U. Platform on Sustainable Finance\nof October 2022 on the four core topics of human rights (including\nlabor rights), corruption/bribery, taxation and fair competition were\ntaken into account here. Minimum social safeguards are to be\nensured by a systematic, integrated and risk-based approach\nto safeguarding our human rights due diligence obligations (see\npage 109), by global labor and social standards (see page 110), and\nby the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 115), among other things.\nTaxonomy-aligned turnover accounted for 0.4% of the total sales\nrevenue defined and reported in the BASF Group\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in 2022. The \u201cmanufacture of organic basic\nchemicals\u201d made the largest contribution (0.3%).

It is not possible to provide information on changes\nin taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures and operating\nexpenditures as these are being reported for the first time in 2022.\nThe taxonomy-aligned figure is significantly lower than the tax-\nonomy-eligible figure due to various factors. Only a small proportion\nof plastics in primary form contain a share of renewable raw materials\nabove the threshold value. In many production processes, sub-\nstances that fall within Annex C1 are used to prevent or reduce\npollution. As a result, these processes are no longer taxonomy-\naligned, even if the substances are not released into the environment\n(for example, because they are exclusively used in a closed system\nin the production plant) and are used in accordance with existing\nchemicals legislation. This means, for example, that all production\nprocesses for the manufacture of battery materials must be\nassessed as not taxonomy-aligned. The proportion of taxonomy-\naligned activities is also reduced by the fact that many plants\nexceed the benchmarks used by the E.U. taxonomy, such as the\nE.U. emissions trading scheme. In addition, plants that are not\nsubject to emissions trading and thus cannot be assessed using the\nspecified criteria were generally classified as not taxonomy-aligned.\nFor more information on sales revenue, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from\npage 227 onward\nFor more information on investments, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfrom page 242 onward.\nGRI 2, 3, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 413\nSUPPLIERS BASF CUSTOMERS\nBASF acknowledges its responsibility to respect internationally recognized human rights.

The expert working group provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. In this way, we want to ensure that we approach our human rights responsibility holistically and that we can continually improve our performance.\nnternational labor and social standards\nOur aim of acting responsibly toward our employees is embedded in\nour global Code of Conduct through our voluntary commitment to\nrespecting international labor and social standards.

In order to\nmeet the requirement to comply with these standards worldwide,\nwe mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social\nstandards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including\ncompliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as\nwith employee representatives or international organizations) and\nthe BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms,\nwhich applies Group-wide. This guideline concretizes the topics in\nour global Code of Conduct under \u201cHuman rights, labor and social\nstandards\u201d as these relate to our employees.

We work to ensure that our partners meet their respective responsibilities.\nWe established a Human Rights Advisory Council in 2020 to integrate external expertise. Its members include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human rights topics helos us to better understand different perspectives and to deal more openly with critical situations.\nThe meetings held in 2022, which were chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer. were attended by representatives from the Corporate Compliance and Corporate Strategv & Sustainability departments as well as other experts from the operating divisions or procurement as required.

We use recognized assessments and audits to verify this. In 2022, we continued our work with our upstream supply chain, where we usually have no direct contractual relationships, less transparency and less influence.

These measures are also\nimportant against the background of new regulations, especially the\nGerman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCA). These include the\nappointment of BASF\u2019s Chief Human Rights Officer and the further\ndevelopment of our Policy Statement on Human Rights, including\nfurther explanations of our approach to human rights due diligence\nand priority risks for our company. Both of these measures were\napproved by the Board of Executive Directors in November 2022.\nTo strengthen due diligence in the supply chain, we have also\nenhanced and refined a range of measures, including supplier risk\nanalysis as well as preventive measures such as the systematic\nbusiness partner due diligence for new suppliers, our Supplier Code\nof Conduct, and the requirements to be embedded in suppliers\u2019\ncontracts. We continue to expect our suppliers to enforce our\nstandards at their suppliers and subcontractors, too. Furthermore,\nthe rights of third-party workers in high-risk countries will be even\nbetter protected in the future through additional due diligence steps.\nThese include risk-based controls and measures that promote\ntransparency and awareness of human rights issues.\nWe have also been able to analyze and confirm BASF\u2019s compliance\nwith the specific environmental treaties covered by the SCA\n(Minamata, Stockholm, Basel) in countries that have not yet ratified\nthese conventions. Promoting awareness of human rights was again a focus topic\nin 2022. Workshop programs on this were held in our operating\ndivisions. In addition, employees in all regions were informed about\nand sensitized to human rights topics through presentations and\ndiscussion formats for specific target groups.\nOur grievance mechanisms, which we already improved in 2021\nwith the introduction of a standardized global hotline and reporting\nsystem, were also used in 2022. A total of 151 human rights-related\ncomplaints were received by phone as well as by post and e-mail\n(2021: 206). All complaints were reviewed and forwarded to the\nrelevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appro-\npriate measures were taken.

BAS's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive Directors' activities and decides on its composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously\nbe a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors defines the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas, including the sustainability strategy. In doing so, the Board ensures that the risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental factors for our company as well as the ecological and societal impacts of BASF's activities are systematically identified and evaluated. In addition to long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy appropriately takes environmental and social objectives into account, too. The corporate planning defined on this basis comprises financial and sustainability-related goals.\nFurthermore, the Board of Executive Directors determines the company's internal organization and decides on the composition of management positions on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value and developing the company over the long term, taking into account environmental and social goals as well as economic targets. The Board's responsibilities include the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of BASF SE and reporting on the company's financial and nonfinancial performance as well as half-year and quarterly reporting. It must\nalso ensure that the company's activities comply with the applicable legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as internal corporate directives (compliance). This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management as well as embedding a company-wide compliance culture with undisputed standards.\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made and all important matters of the company are discussed at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors.\nBoard decisions are based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. The chair of the Board of Executive Directors leads the Board meetings. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors gives the casting vote.\nHowever, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors cannot enforce a decision against the Board of Executive Directors' majority vote. The chair of the Board also does not have the right to veto.\nOutside of matters that are assigned to the entire Board for consultation and decision-making, all members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their designated areas of responsibility.\nThe Board of Executive Directors can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual issues such as proposed material acquisition or divestiture prolects or to prepare decisions to be\nmade by the entire Board. These must include at least three\nmembers of the Board of Executive Directors.

All of BASF SE\u2019s shares\nare registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have themselves\nentered with their shares into the company share register and to\nprovide the information necessary for registration in the share regis-\nter according to the German Stock Corporation Act. There are no\nregistration restrictions and there is no limit to the number of shares\nthat can be registered to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in\nthe share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed share-\nholders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting either personally, through a representative of their choice or\nthrough a company-appointed proxy authorized by the shareholders\nto vote according to their instructions. Individual instructions are only\nforwarded to the company on the morning of the day of the Annual\nShareholders\u2019 Meeting. Voting rights can be exercised according to\nshareholders\u2019 instructions by company-appointed proxies until the\nbeginning of the voting process during the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes\na shareholder may cast nor special voting rights.

BASF SE follows\nall of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance\nCode in the version dated April 28, 2022 (Code 2022), the version in\nforce at the time of submitting the Declaration of Conformity on\nDecember 15, 2022. Until then, BASF has complied with all recom-\nmendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the\nversion dated December 16, 2019 (Code 2020). In the same\nmanner, BASF follows all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the\nGerman Corporate Governance Code.\nThe joint Declaration of Conformity 2022 by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of\nBASF SE is rendered on page 193\nFor more information on the Declaration of Conformity 2022, the implementation of the Code\u2019s\nsuggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance.

Each share\nentitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\nRestrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The\nsame rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes,\nshareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates (issuance\nof share certificates). There are neither different classes of shares\nnor shares with preferential voting rights.\nAppointment and dismissal of members of the Board of\nExecutive Directors\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Execu-\ntive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article 39 of\nthe SE Council Regulation, section 16 of the SE Implementation Act\nand sections 84 and 85 AktG as well as Article 7 of the Statutes of\nBASF SE. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the\nnumber of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least\ntwo), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors,\nand can nominate a chair, as well as one or more vice chairs. The\nmembers of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a\nmaximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is\nthree years. Reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory\nBoard can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if\nthere is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular,\na gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive\nDirectors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders\u2019\nMeeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and\ndismissals according to its own best judgment.\nCompliance culture at BASF\nFor corporate compliance to be a success, there must be an active\nculture of living these values and commitments within the company.\nThe principles embedded in our Code of Conduct are established\nand recognized in our day-to-day business. We expect all employees\nto act in line with these principles. Our leaders play a key role here \u2013\nthey serve as an example of and communicate our values and\nculture both internally and externally. That is why special workshops\non integrity as a leadership task were again held in 2022 for newly\nappointed senior executives.\nMonitoring adherence to our compliance principles\nBASF\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the\nChairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the\nfurther development of our global compliance organization and our\nCompliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this\ntask by the Corporate Compliance department and more than\n100 compliance officers worldwide in the regions and countries as\nwell as in the divisions, service units and in the Corporate Center.\nMaterial compliance topics are regularly discussed in the compliance\ncommittees established at global and regional level. The compliance\norganization reports to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee in\nat least one of its meetings each year on the status of the Compliance\nProgram as well as any major developments. In the event of signifi-\ncant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the\nBoard of Executive Directors.\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly\nseek guidance if in doubt. They can consult their supervisors,\nspecialist departments, such as the Legal department, and company\ncompliance officers. The internal platform and the corresponding\napp also help employees to access advice by enabling direct\ncontact. In addition, our employees can contact our compliance\nhotline \u2013 including anonymously \u2013 to report potential violations of\nlaws or company guidelines. An independent external company has\nbeen contracted to manage this global hotline so that reported\ncases are recorded and processed worldwide through one system.\nThe central point of contact is a website that informs all employees\nworldwide about the hotline and the grievance procedure in their\nnational language. In addition to local phone numbers, the website\nalso offers an online contact option, which is available via PC or\nsmartphone. The website is also available to the public. Each\nconcern is documented according to specific criteria, properly\ninvestigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered\nas quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as\nany measures taken are documented accordingly and included in\ninternal reports.\nIn 2022, 453 reports were received by our external hotlines (2021:\n277). The information received related to all categories of our Code\nof Conduct, including respect in the workplace, corruption, handling\nof company property and environmental, health and safety issues.\nWe carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that\ncame to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures\non a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved\ncontrol mechanisms, additional informational and training measures,\nclarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as\nwell as disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified\ncases related to violations of our principles on respect in the work-\nplace and personal misconduct in connection with the protection of\ncompany property or inappropriate handling of conflicts of interests.\nIn such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance\nwith uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for damages\nwhere there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2022, violations\nof our Code of Conduct led to termination of employment in a total\nof 34 cases (2021: 32). This relates to diverse employee groups,\nincluding executives.\nBASF\u2019s Corporate Audit department monitors adherence to\ncompliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance\nviolations could occur. They check that employees uphold regu-\nlations and make sure that the established processes, procedures\nand monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize\npotential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2022,\n47 audits of this kind were performed Group-wide (2021: 77). Our\n180\ncompliance management system itself is also regularly audited by\nthe internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in December\n2022. Overall, the audit results speak for the effectiveness of the\ncompliance management system. As part of the comprehensive\naction plan developed last year for the continuous, systematic\noptimization of our compliance management system, we worked on\nstrengthening key processes in 2022 and described the principles,\ncore processes and roles in our system in detail in a revised\ninternal policy, Compliance Management System (CMS), which\nwas approved by the Board of Executive Directors in August 2022.\nA particular focus of our compliance activities in 2022 was the\nfurther development of our internal systems and processes in light\nof changes to supply chain law, including the German Supply Chain\nDue Diligence Act (SCA) (see page 111).\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance\nrisks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due\nDiligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based\nanalysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are\nnot prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a\nbusiness relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code\nof Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance standards, among\nother requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also\ncheck whether persons, companies or organizations appear on\nsanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities and whether there\nare business processes with business partners from or in countries\nunder embargo. One focus of our activities in 2022 was on the\ncontinuous monitoring and implementation of the dynamically evolv-\ning sanctions law requirements in light of the war in Ukraine.\nWe support the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and\nHuman Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal\nguidelines and processes in keeping with these principles. For\nexample, there is an internal guideline to respect international\nlabor and social standards that is applicable throughout the\nGroup. Outside of our company, too, we support respect for human\nrights and the fight against corruption. We are a founding member\nof the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of Transparency\nBASF Report 2022 Corporate Governance \u2013 Compliance 181\nInternational Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption\nInitiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in the\nimplementation of these organizations\u2019 objectives.\nWe are committed to adhering to uniformly high standards and\nintegrity regarding tax-related issues, as embedded in BASF\u2019s Code\nof Conduct and corporate values. To aid in the achievement of the\nU.N. SDGs and to meet our own standards for the creation of\neconomic and social value, we contribute to public finances in\naccordance with legal requirements and our corporate values. In\n2020, we developed and published the BASF tax principles, which\nare binding for all Group entities.\nFor more information on the Supplier Code of Conduct and supplier assessments,\nsee page 114 onward\nFor more information on the Code of Conduct, see basf.com/code-of-conduct\nFor more information on human rights and labor and social standards, see\nbasf.com/human_rights\nFor more information on tax principles, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\nBASF's Compliance Program is based on our corporate values and voluntary commitments, as well as international standards. It describes our commitment to responsible conduct and expectations around how all BAS employees interact with business partners, officials, coworkers and the community. At the core of our Compliance Program is the global, standardized Code of Conduct. All employees and leaders are obligated to adhere to its guidelines, which cover topics ranging from corruption and antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy.\nThe online version of our Code of Conduct is aimed at our emplovees and also offers user-friendly features such as case studies, FAQs and additional references. The internal online platform and the corresponding app provide our employees worldwide with up-to-date content such as videos and links to specialist units and guidelines as well as direct contact to subject specialists.\nOther binding governance documents (policies, corporate require-ments) are published on a digital platform that offers our employees an effective search function and context-based links to further information. The managing directors of BAS Group companies can find important information and assistance on ensuring compliance in their Group companies on an intranet page set up especially for them.\nAbiding by compliance standards is the foundation of responsible leadership. This has also been embedded in our values. We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a key role in securing our company's long-term success. Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset.\nWe perform a systematic risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance violations, including corruption risks. These are conducted at divisional and Group company level. The regular compliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are another source of information for the systematic identification of risks. These risks are documented in the relevant risk or audit report.\nThe same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the time frame for their implementation.\nOne key element in violation prevention is compulsory training and workshops held as classroom or online courses. All employees are required within a prescribed time frame to take part in basic training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations. Newly appointed senior executives also receive special training on leading with integrity. Course materials and formats are constantly updated, taking into account the specific risks of individual target groups and business areas. In total, more than 30,000 participants worldwide received over 50,000 hours of compliance training in 2022.\nThe image is an infographic titled \"Compliance,\" which describes the company's Compliance Program and Code of Conduct. Here is a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Compliance\nThe main aim of the Group-wide Compliance Program is to ensure adherence to legal regulations, the company\u2019s internal guidelines, and ethical business practices. The Code of Conduct embeds these mandatory standards into employees\u2019 day-to-day business.

It suggests suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting for election . The committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , who serves as its chairman , and three further stockholder representatives . The Nominations Committee convened twice in 2022 . At a meeting in January , it resolved \u2013 without the members in question voting on the resolution \u2013 to recommend to the Supervisory Board that Dr. Paul Achleitner , Dr. Norbert Bischofberger , and Colleen A. Goggins be proposed to the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting for reelection to the Supervisory Board . At a meeting in August , the committee resolved to recommend to the competent court that Kimberly Mathisen be appointed to succeed Dr. Fei-Fei Li , who stepped down from the Supervisory Board for medical reasons . Innovation Committee : The Innovation Committee is primarily concerned with the innovation strategy and innovation management , the strategy for the protection of intellectual property , and major research and development programs at Bayer . Within its area of responsibility , the committee advises and oversees management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions to be made . The Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven other members of the Supervisory Board , with parity of representation between stockholder and employee representatives . The meetings of the Innovation Committee are regularly attended by the Chairman of the Board of Management , as well as by further members of the Board of Management depending on the topics for discussion . Bayer Annual Report 2022 To our Stockholders Report of the Supervisory Board 20The Innovation Committee convened twice in 2022 . 1 . At its meeting in February , it dealt with the outlook for research , development and innovation in the Pharmaceuticals Division . 2 . At its meeting in May , the Innovation Committee dealt with transformative RNA-based strategies and discussed their significance for the individual divisions and for Leaps by Bayer . ESG Committee : Established at the beginning of 2022 , the ESG Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven other members , with parity of representation between stockholders and employees . It deals with sustainable corporate governance and the company \u2019 s business activities in the areas of environmental protection , social issues and corporate governance ( ESG ) . This mainly pertains to the way sustainability is incorporated into the business strategy ; the establishment of sustainability targets ; nonmandatory ESG reporting and the auditing thereof , if applicable ; opportunities and risks ; and organizational structures and processes in ESG areas , provided the Audit Committee is not already responsible for these matters . Within its area of responsibility , the committee advises and oversees the management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions to be made . The ESG Committee convened twice in 2022 : 1 . At its first meeting in February , the committee initially dealt with how it would go about its duties in the future . It then discussed Bayer \u2019 s sustainability performance in 2021 , as well as ESG benchmarks and controversies , and looked ahead to the ESG priorities for 2022 . 2 . At its meeting in August , the committee discussed the Bayer Sustainability Council \u2019 s focal topics for 2022 with the Co-Chairs of that body . The committee discussed the status of the sustainability targets , benchmarks and strategies , and dealt in depth with Bayer \u2019 s contribution to climate protection . In June , the Supervisory Board conducted a training session focused on digitalization and its impact on Bayer . This was the first of a three-part series of training sessions dealing with these issues . Corporate governance The Supervisory Board considered the principles of corporate governance at Bayer . In particular , at its December meeting , it dealt with the declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code and resolved to amend its rules of procedure . During Supervisory Board meetings , the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also summarized the dialogue he had engaged in with investors during investor discussions in September and October concerning Board of Management compensation and compensation reporting , as well as during a number of individual conversations . Disclosure of meeting participation on an individual basis The members \u2019 attendance rate in the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and the committees was 92 % . This was largely attributable to the long-term illness of one member of the Supervisory Board . The attendance rate of the other Supervisory Board members was just under 95 % . In view of the special circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of an endeavor to hold the meetings in more contemporary and sustainable formats , the meetings in 2022 took place not only as in-person meetings , but also as virtual meetings via video-conferencing or as in-person meetings with the option of participation in virtual form ( hybrid meetings ) . None of the meetings took place as a telephone conference call . The participation of the individual Supervisory Board members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is shown below : Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 41All major projects relating to tangible and intangible assets were analyzed to ascertain their taxonomy eligibility and classified in accordance with the activities of the EU taxonomy . The taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure was then reviewed using technical screening criteria for each activity to determine its taxonomy alignment . The detailed analyses were conducted by the departments of the respective business units to ensure correct allocation . Our relevant economic activities in 2022 can contribute to both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation . To avoid double counting within an indicator , taxonomy alignment was reviewed under the environmental objective climate change mitigation . We examined whether or not an economic activity contributes substantially to climate change mitigation based on the individual asset . To rule out significant harm being caused to other environmental objectives , we assessed the respective criteria at various levels . The criteria for climate change adaptation were assessed at site level , while the in some cases highly granular requirements for the other environmental objectives were examined at the individual asset level . Compliance with the minimum safeguards was examined at Group level , taking into account existing corporate policies and risk management processes with respect to human rights , compliance , anticorruption and other aspects . Following detailed analysis , we classified the noncapitalizable expenditure within the capital expenditure projects as immaterial . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 46// Innovation // Access to healthcare // Sustainable food supply // Product stewardship // Climate and environmental protection // Business ethics As part of our stakeholder engagement process , which is underpinned by a dedicated guideline , we approach key social and political players and seek dialogue from the outset in strategic decision-making processes regarding new projects such as investment projects and launches of new products . Respect for human rights Observing human rights is fundamental to the way we operate . We have documented our stance in a globally binding corporate policy entitled the Bayer Human Rights Policy . We further developed our corresponding strategy in 2022 and are currently updating our human rights policy . Human rights due diligence is a continuous process that we constantly adapt and improve . To specifically ensure respect for human rights in the value chain , we employ a due diligence approach based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises . We take steps to ensure human rights are respected both within our own company and along our entire value chain . Corporate policies , processes , and management and monitoring systems are in place to govern the implementation of human rights standards . We offer special training programs to continuously enhance employees \u2019 awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day activities . We launched a specific human rights training program in English in 2021 , and added an additional eight languages in 2022 . We also demand that our business partners , particularly our suppliers , fully observe human rights . We are a founding member of the UN Global Compact and respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the UN International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the UNGPs and a range of globally recognized declarations applicable to multinational corporations , including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy , and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) . As part of our risk management process , we conduct a risk analysis of the potentially adverse consequences of our operating activities for human rights . See the Opportunity and Risk Report for the risk status identified for this area in 2022 . We did not identify any potentially negative effects that were reportable under the CSR Directive Implementation Act . Donations and foundations Together with our network of leading partners , such as the Bayer foundations and other non-profits , we support social impact projects in the areas of health , nutrition , science and environment , and community engagement . Responding to disasters by providing humanitarian aid also plays a crucial role in our social commitment . Through our disaster relief programs , we support communities affected by natural disasters and public health crises . In 2022 , we provided around \u20ac37 million in charitable donations and social impact programs worldwide . In addition to the financial contributions , products costing around \u20ac16 million were donated to organizations in countries and communities in need . 66 % of our contributions ( cash and products ) went to low- and middle-income countries . In 2022 , we conducted more than 400 social projects worldwide with partner organizations , including the Bayer foundations ( Bayer Cares Foundation , Bayer Science & Education Foundation , Bayer Fund ( US ) and Bayer Foundation India ) , which generate an important impact for society in line with our vision and Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 47corporate purpose . Our donation activities in 2022 were mainly focused on humanitarian support in Ukraine and eastern European countries , as well as on our commitment to water access and the promotion of social innovations in agriculture . The contributions we make to support social causes \u2013 in the form of monetary , product or other in-kind donations \u2013 are governed by our global \u201c Corporate Charitable Giving Procedure , \u201d which was revised in late 2020 . It establishes clear criteria for recipient eligibility and project selection , and also sets forth the strategy we follow to generate long-term impact for society in line with our sustainability goals . Our charitable donations are recorded and approved centrally , which provides a transparent overview of our contributions to supporting social causes around the world . 1.2.3 Management Systems Planning and steering Economic planning and steering are conducted in line with the frameworks that are set for the Group and the divisions by the Board of Management in the course of the strategic planning process , and are translated into specific targets during operational planning . The planning and steering process is complemented by the continuous monitoring of business developments , with key financial and nonfinancial management and performance indicators being updated regularly . The following financial and nonfinancial indicators are employed to plan , steer and monitor the development of our business : Operational management indicators The main parameters in performance management at the operational level are sales growth , earnings and cash flow data , which also form the basis of short-term variable compensation ( STI ) . Sales growth is measured in terms of the change in sales after adjusting for currency and portfolio effects ( Fx & portfolio adj . ) in order to reflect the operational business development of the Group and the divisions . A key measure of profitability is the EBITDA margin before special items , which is the ratio of EBITDA before special items to sales . Another important profitability indicator for the Bayer Group is core earnings per share , which is the core net income divided by the weighted average number of shares . The free cash flow \u2013 an absolute indicator \u2013 shows the generation of freely available financial resources and also reflects the company \u2019 s financial strength and earning power . Strategic value management indicator : ROCE Return on capital employed ( ROCE ) is used as a strategic metric to measure the company \u2019 s operating profit after taxes in relation to the average capital employed . Comparing ROCE against the weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) on an annual basis illustrates the level of value creation . It also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) . Total shareholder return We aim to create shareholder value and thus deliver attractive returns for our stockholders . Total shareholder return , which is determined based on the change in the share price over the measurement period plus any dividends paid in the interim , also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.3 Focus on Innovation 48Sustainability We aim to improve people \u2019 s lives through our products . At the same time , we also endeavor to reduce our ecological footprint . We regulate and measure the attainment of our sustainability targets with the aid of nonfinancial key performance indicators ( KPIs ) . We take into account the number of people reached in the \u201c 100 million \u201d divisional targets and our greenhouse gas emissions as indicators for tracking the sustainable steering of our business and the reduction of our ecological footprint ( see A 1.2.1/2 ) . Our sustainability KPIs are also reflected in our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) program . Integrated management system We maintain a Group-wide integrated management system ( IMS ) , which is detailed in a corporate policy . The IMS provides a framework for all management systems at Bayer , ensuring compliance with the law and with internal and external requirements while also ensuring efficient ways of working . This is achieved through internal regulations and applicable processes involving clear roles and responsibilities . The IMS therefore plays a key role in safeguarding our company \u2019 s license to operate . 1.3 Focus on Innovation Our new solutions generate added value for our customers and society . Our activities focus on innovative products based on our research and development ( R & D ) competencies supplemented with new approaches in our process , service and business models . We also focus on social innovation to improve living conditions for people in developing countries and disadvantaged individuals in our society . The results of our research and development help us contribute to solving global challenges in medical care and agriculture . In addition to the strong innovative capabilities of our employees throughout the company , our efforts are driven by a broad open innovation network and the use of new , groundbreaking technologies with a particular focus on data science insights . Partnerships are integral to our innovation strategy , ensuring access to complementary technologies and expertise . We enter into strategic alliances with various partners such as universities , governmental agencies , start-ups , suppliers and other industrial companies . We maintain a global network of R & D locations , which employ roughly 16,200 Bayer employees . In 2022 , our research and development spend before special items amounted to \u20ac6,168 million ( 2021 : \u20ac5,326 million ) . Excellence in research and development The activities we pursue are aligned with the innovation strategies of our divisions and are aimed at improving human and plant health and sustainably safeguarding stable harvests in agriculture in step with our vision \u201c Health for all , hunger for none. \u201d We are increasingly employing data science methods in the R & D projects of our three divisions , strategically coordinated by the cross-divisional Digital Transformation Board ( DTB ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.4 Commitment to Employees 69In the Asia/Pacific region , we expanded our range of Redoxon\u2122 supplements in our Nutritionals category with the launch of Redoxon\u2122 Immunity+ product to strengthen the immune system and bone development for adults and children . We also expanded our Elevit\u2122 range in China , with the launch of an infant line containing calcium and vitamin D. In India , we extended our Supradyn\u2122 portfolio in the Nutritionals category with the launch of Supradyn\u2122 Immuno+ in a film-coated tablet format . In the United States , we launched Astepro\u2122 as an OTC product , following the FDA \u2019 s approval of the switch from Rx status in 2021 . Astepro\u2122 relieves nasal congestion , sneezing and a runny or itchy nose due to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies . It is the first and only steroid-free antihistamine nasal spray on the US market that is available over-the-counter for adults and children aged six and above that works in 30 minutes and lasts 24 hours . 1.4 Commitment to Employees Bayer \u2019 s business success is essentially built on the knowledge and commitment of our workforce . As an employer , we offer our employees attractive conditions and wide-ranging individual development opportunities . Alongside professional training , we focus on promoting a dialogue- and feedback-oriented culture based on trust , intentional inclusion , and respect for diversity and equality of opportunity , which is also summarized in our corporate policy entitled \u201c Fairness and Respect at Work. \u201d Our employees worldwide are trained to comply with these guidelines . We measure the engagement and satisfaction of our employees by means of systematic feedback discussions and regular employee surveys . Responsibility for the human resources strategy of the Bayer Group lies with the Board of Management , supported by Bayer \u2019 s Human Resources enabling function . The strategy is globally implemented within the scope of binding policies . For more than 10 years , Bayer \u2019 s LIFE values ( Leadership , Integrity , Flexibility and Efficiency ) have guided us in our activities . These stand for our values and leadership principles . Attributes define each value \u2019 s practical meaning and behaviors , serving as the sole reference for how employees work at Bayer . Employees at all Bayer sites around the world have the right to elect their own representatives . In 2022 , the working conditions for around 53 % ( 2021 : 54 % ) of our employees worldwide were governed by collective or company agreements . Employee data On December 31 , 2022 , we employed 101,369 people ( 2021 : 99,637 ) worldwide . In Germany , we had 22,569 ( 2021 : 23,116 ) employees , representing 22.3 % of the total Group workforce ( 2021 : 23.2 % ) . In 2022 , the Bayer Group hired 12,433 new employees ( accounting for 12.3 % of our workforce ) . On the reporting date , our employees had worked for the Bayer Group for an average of 11.0 years ( 2021 : 11.2 ) . Our workforce includes only a small number of employees on temporary contracts ( 3.4 % ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 115 results of internal and external assessments carried out at least once every five years by a qualified independent assessor . The most recent assessment was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2022 , yielding the best results possible . In addition , the fundamental suitability of the early warning system is assessed by the external auditor as an independent external body as part of its audit of the annual financial statements . Basic elements of the Bayer risk management system Risk culture and objectives of the risk management system All levels of the company are included in risk management in order to heighten the awareness and understanding of risks . This lays the foundation for a risk culture with independent , proactive and systematic risk management involving clearly defined roles and responsibilities , principles , standards , methods , tools and training measures . The aims of the risk management system are to achieve risk transparency , which also encompasses the early detection of risks , to support risk-based ( treatment ) decisions and to ensure compliance with legal requirements . ERM : risk management process Identification : Risks are identified by risk owners in the divisions and enabling functions . To help ensure we identify risks as comprehensively as possible , we maintain a risk universe that reflects the company \u2019 s potential risk categories . The Bayer Risk Universe , which is regularly updated , also expressly accounts for risks of a nonfinancial nature that are linked to our business activity or to our business relationships , products and services . Risks pursuant to the Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) Directive Implementation Act that relate to environmental , employee and social issues , human rights , corruption and bribery ( compliance ) are included as well . Further information on the nonfinancial statement can be found in the \u201c About this Report \u201d section . Assessment : Where possible , the identified risks are evaluated with regard to their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence using the following matrix . Risks are assessed on a net basis , taking into account the risk control measures in place to mitigate the potential impact and/or likelihood of occurrence .

See Note [ 30 ] to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group under \u201c Legal risks. \u201d The legal proceedings outlined there are those currently considered to involve material risks and do not represent an exhaustive list . The general risks to which we are potentially exposed include those in the areas of product liability , competition and antitrust law , anti-corruption law , patent law , tax law , data privacy and environmental protection , for example . Investigations of possible legal or regulatory violations may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties \u2013 including substantial monetary fines \u2013 and/or other adverse financial consequences . Payments may also need to be made under out-of-court settlements . These risks may harm our reputation and hamper our commercial success . We have established a global compliance management system to ensure the observance of laws and regulations . Glyphosate matter A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer \u2019 s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon Monsanto in the United States . Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto \u2019 s herbicides , including Roundup\u2122-branded products . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) and multiple myeloma , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Plaintiffs claim , inter alia , that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew , or should have known , of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users . Additional lawsuits are anticipated . The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and California . Cases pending in US federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) in the Northern District of California for common pre-trial management . In 2020 , Monsanto reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs , without admission of liability , to settle most of the current Roundup\u2122 litigation . As of February 1 , 2023 , Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial number of claims . As we now have greater visibility regarding the number and quality of claims made , we consider that , of the approximately 154,000 claims in total , approximately 109,000 have been settled or are not eligible for various reasons . The three adverse verdicts \u2013 Johnson , Hardeman and Pilliod \u2013 were not covered by the settlement . In both the Hardeman and Pilliod cases , following unsuccessful appeal procedures , the Company petitioned the Supreme Court for review . In June 2022 , the Supreme Court denied review of both Hardeman and Pilliod . There may be future cases in the Roundup\u2122 litigation ( or other unrelated actions ) that present the Supreme Court with preemption questions , and the Company will continue to review its legal options regarding further proceedings . Currently , in the Carson case , the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals \u2019 en banc full panel is considering plaintiff \u2019 s appeal of a Georgia federal district court \u2019 s grant of preemption in Monsanto \u2019 s favor . Oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for June 2023 . In the Schaffner case , the 3rd Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is considering Monsanto \u2019 s appeal of the MDL court \u2019 s denial of preemption . Briefing in the appeal is ongoing . In November 2022 , the jury in the Ferro ( St. Louis County , Missouri ) case issued a verdict in Monsanto \u2019 s favor , determining that Roundup\u2122 did not cause the plaintiff \u2019 s cancer . This is the sixth consecutive trial win for the Company . For costs to resolve potential future claims , Bayer has implemented corresponding accounting measures . As of December 31 , 2022 , Bayer had a provision of US $ 6.4 billion for the aforementioned settlements to resolve existing and future glyphosate claims . Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with these products . As of February 1 , 2023 , a total of 31 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup\u2122 had been served upon Bayer , including 11 seeking class action certification . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 132 Implementation status of the objectives The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience or an international background . The ages of the members of the Supervisory Board were relatively evenly spread across a range of 41 to 68 years as of December 31 , 2022 . One member of the Supervisory Board , Dr. Paul Achleitner , has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years . As such , the Supervisory Board does not consider him to be independent as defined in Section C.7 of the German Corporate Governance Code . However , the Supervisory Board does not harbor any concerns about Dr. Achleitner \u2019 s impartiality or any potential conflicts of interest . The Supervisory Board considers the stockholder representatives Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah , Horst Baier , Dr. Norbert Bischofberger , Ertharin Cousin , Colleen A. Goggins , Kimberly Mathisen , Alberto Weisser , Prof. Dr. Otmar Wiestler and Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann to be independent . The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is currently 45 % for the full Supervisory Board , 50 % for the employee representatives and 40 % for the stockholder representatives . Seven of the 20 members of the Supervisory Board are citizens of a country other than Germany . Numerous other members have many years of international business experience . The members of the Supervisory Board have also completed a whole range of vocational training and study courses . For the purposes of the qualification matrices below , the Supervisory Board primarily considers its members to possess expertise and experience in the corresponding areas if they have completed professional training in that field or have amassed many years of professional experience ( including several years as a member of the Supervisory Board or one of its respective committees ) . In the opinion of the Supervisory Board , the stockholder representatives have the following special expertise and experience , as well as the following independence status : A 4.1/1 Expertise and Experience of Shareholder Representatives on the Supervisory Board Interna-tionalbusinessexperience R & DAgri-culture/ foodHealth-care FinanceControlling/risk manage-ment HRGovern-ance/ compli-ance DigitalSustain-ability/ climate protec-tionIndepen-denceDr .

Norbert Winkeljohann , Chairman of the Supervisory Board and a member of the Audit Committee , has special expertise in the field of auditing . This expertise is based on his training as an auditor , academic work in this field and longstanding experience as an external auditor for publicly listed companies and as a Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.2 Compliance 134 Further information Securities transactions by members of governance bodies Members of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board and persons with whom they have close relationships are legally obligated to report own-account transactions in shares or debt securities of Bayer AG , associated derivatives or other associated financial instruments to Bayer AG and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) as soon as the total volume of transactions made by a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board , or a person with whom they have a close relationship , has reached the \u20ac20,000 threshold within a calendar year . The transactions reported to Bayer AG in 2022 were duly published and can be viewed on the company \u2019 s website . 4.2 Compliance We define compliance as legally impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work , because the way they carry out their duties affects our company \u2019 s reputation . We do not tolerate any violation of applicable laws , codes of conduct or internal regulations . Compliance is essential for our long-term economic success . The following compliance principles apply throughout the Bayer Group : // We compete fairly in every market . // We act with integrity in all our business dealings . // We balance economic growth with ecological and social responsibility . // We observe trade controls that regulate our global business . // We safeguard equal opportunity in securities trading . // We keep accurate books and records . // We treat each other with fairness and respect . // We protect and respect intellectual property rights . // We act in Bayer \u2019 s best interest . // We protect and secure personal data . All employees are required to observe the compliance principles and to immediately report any violation of the Corporate Compliance Policy . Infringements are sanctioned . This applies in particular to managerial employees , who , for example , may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be subject to further disciplinary measures if violations have occurred in their sphere of responsibility that they could have prevented . Compliant and lawful conduct also factors into the performance evaluations of all managerial employees . The global compliance management system is steered by a central compliance organization within the Bayer Group that reports to the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board . The CFO is responsible for the compliance organization , while the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board oversees the effectiveness and further development of compliance within the Group . Potential compliance risks ( such as corruption ) are identified together with the operational units to ensure the systematic and preventive detection and assessment of risks . Potential risks are then entered into global databases that we use to develop suitable measures for specific processes , business activities or countries , for example . In addition , we assess our business partners according to risk criteria as we look to identify potential compliance risks . Adherence to the corporate compliance principles is among the subjects covered in audits conducted by Bayer \u2019 s Internal Audit and in the analyses and investigations by the legal and compliance organization . The heads of these organizations provide regular reports on the findings of the audits and analyses to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board , while summary reports are presented at least once a year . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.2 Compliance 135 Handling of suspected and actual compliance violations Suspected compliance violations can be reported \u2013 anonymously if desired and if permitted by respective national law \u2013 to a globally accessible compliance hotline that is operated by an independent service provider . Reports can be submitted either online or by telephone , with calls answered by trained , independent specialists . Those submitting reports can do so in their preferred language . The hotline is also accessible to the general public . In 2022 , the compliance organization received a total of 372 compliance reports in this way . In addition , there is a so-called \u201c speak-up inbox \u201d at Bayer for the submission of suspected compliance violations . Alternatively , suspected violations may also be reported to the local compliance function , Internal Audit , Human Resources or directly to the supervisor . Suspected compliance violations may also be reported by logging a so-called incident request on a platform . Moreover , the compliance function records and processes compliance violations discovered as part of monitoring activities . Compliance violations include all possible types of infringements of internal and external requirements and are systematically sanctioned . The action taken depends on factors including the gravity of the compliance violation and applicable law . Compliance training and communications activities We support all employees in acting with integrity and proactively avoiding potential violations by implementing Bayer-wide training measures that are tailored to target groups and based on identified needs and are flanked by communication campaigns . Supervisors and/or compliance managers can be consulted if there are any questions about lawful behavior . In 2022 , some 96.5 % of Bayer \u2019 s managerial employees worldwide completed at least one compliance training program . Overall , around 85.1 % of employees took part in the global web-based training program on conflicts of interest . Training measures on anti-corruption , the importance of openly expressing concerns ( \u201c speak up \u201d ) , antitrust law , conflicts of interest , fairness and respect in the workplace , foreign trade law compliance , product-related communication and data protection are fundamental elements of our compliance management system . Marketing compliance and applicability of accepted standards We are committed to responsible marketing practices . Our efforts in this regard are guided by our Corporate Compliance Policy , Anti-Corruption Policy and rules of conduct for responsible marketing , for example . We have also put in place directives and corporate policies that are designed to prevent price fixing and ensure data protection . Various industry codes such as those of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations ( IFPMA ) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ( EFPIA ) also apply in marketing and distribution . As regards the advertising of human pharmaceutical products , we comply with the IFPMA Code of Practice as the minimum global standard , along with the regulations set out in the applicable regional and national codes . Pharmaceuticals observes the applicable transparency rules ( e.g. , the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the United States ) and participates in voluntary programs such as the EFPIA Disclosure Code . Crop Science \u2019 s Product Stewardship Commitment applies to all products , services and technologies and is in alignment with the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations and the Code of Conduct on Plant Biotechnology issued by CropLife International , for example . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code 136 Lobbying Forming part of our commitment to ensuring transparent lobbying , our corporate policy entitled \u201c Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying \u201d sets out binding rules for our involvement in political matters and creates transparency in our interactions with the representatives of political institutions . As set out in this code of conduct , our company did not make any donations to political parties , politicians or candidates for political office in 2022 . Effective January 1 , 2022 , we abolished our applicable exemption for the United States meaning that we no longer donate directly as a company . However , one special aspect continues to apply : employees can make private donations in support of political nominees at the federal level through so-called \u201c political action committees. \u201d These voluntary donations are made only by employees , not the company . Decisions on how the donations made through Bayer \u2019 s political action committee , BAYERPAC , are allocated are made by an independent committee made up of employees . The allocation criteria it applies reflect societal challenges , among other factors . These donations are subject to narrow conditions and mandatory transparency measures . We also apply the Bayer Societal Engagement ( BASE ) principles , which are afforded the status of a corporate policy and serve to codify our standards and values to an even greater degree . 4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code The Bayer Group meets the requirements for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 289 b through e and 315 b and c of the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) . The relevant disclosures pertaining to the nonfinancial statement in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive Implementation Act ( CSR-RUG ) are integrated into the management report , with the GRI standards ( Section 289d HGB ) serving as a framework . The Supervisory Board fulfilled its auditing duty for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Section 170 , Paragraph 1 and Section 171 , Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 B Consolidated Financial StatementsNotes to the Statements of Financial Position 22630 . Legal risks As a global company with extensive business activities , the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks , particularly in the areas of product liability , competition and antitrust law , anticorruption , patent disputes , tax assessments and environmental matters . The outcome of any current or future proceedings can not normally be predicted . It is therefore possible that legal or regulatory judgments or future settlements could give rise to expenses that are not covered , or not fully covered , by insurers \u2019 compensation payments and could significantly affect our sales and earnings . Legal proceedings we currently consider to be material are outlined below . The legal proceedings referred to do not represent an exhaustive list . Product-related litigation Essure\u2122 : In the United States , a large number of lawsuits by users of Essure\u2122 , a medical device offering permanent birth control with a nonsurgical procedure , had been served upon Bayer . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries from the use of Essure\u2122 , including hysterectomy , perforation , pain , bleeding , weight gain , nickel sensitivity , depression and unwanted pregnancy , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Bayer reached agreements in principle with plaintiff law firms to resolve approximately 99 % of the nearly 40,000 total filed and unfiled US Essure\u2122 claims involving women who allege device-related injuries . The settlements include all of the jurisdictions with significant volumes of Essure\u2122 cases , including the state of California Joint Council Coordinated Proceedings ( JCCP ) and the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ( EDPA ) . Taking into account the payments already made , the remaining provision for settlements amounts to US $ 0.1 billion as of December 31 , 2022 . This includes an allowance for outstanding claims , and the company is in resolution discussions with counsel for the remaining plaintiffs . At the same time , we continue to support the safety and efficacy of the Essure\u2122 device and are prepared to vigorously defend it in litigation where no amicable resolution can be achieved . As of February 1 , 2023 , two Canadian lawsuits relating to Essure\u2122 seeking class action certification had been served upon Bayer . One of the proposed class actions has been certified . Certification in the other class action has been denied ; the decision has been appealed by plaintiffs . In addition , approximately 160 single-plaintiff claims have been served on Bayer . Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously . Class actions over neonicotinoids in Canada : Proposed class actions against Bayer were filed in Quebec and Ontario ( Canada ) concerning crop protection products containing the active substances imidacloprid and clothianidin ( neonicotinoids ) . The plaintiffs are honey producers , who have filed a proposed nationwide class action in Ontario and a Quebec-only class action in Quebec . Plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages and punitive damages and allege Bayer and another crop protection company were negligent in the design , development , marketing and sale of neonicotinoid pesticides . The proposed Ontario class action is in a very early procedural phase . In Quebec , a court certified a class proposed by plaintiffs in 2018 . Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously . Roundup\u2122 ( glyphosate ) : A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer \u2019 s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon Monsanto in the United States . Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto \u2019 s herbicides , including Roundup\u2122-branded products . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) and multiple myeloma , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Plaintiffs claim , inter alia , that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew , or should have known , of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users . Additional lawsuits are anticipated . The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and California . Cases pending in US federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) in the Northern District of California for common pre-trial management . In 2020 , Monsanto reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs , without admission of liability , to settle most of the current Roundup\u2122 litigation . As of February 1 , 2023 , Monsanto had reached settlements"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

At the beginning of the year , it consisted of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and three other Supervisory Board members . In December , the Supervisory Board expanded this committee to six members while maintaining parity of representation and changed its name to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee ( previously : Human Resources Committee ) . In December , the Vice Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee were elected as additional members of this committee . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee prepares the personnel decisions of the full Supervisory Board , which resolves on appointments or dismissals of members of the Board of Management , and monitors the development of Board of Management compensation on an ongoing basis . The committee resolves on behalf of the Supervisory Board on the service contracts of the members of the Board of Management . However , it is the task of the full Supervisory Board to resolve on the total compensation of the individual members of the Board of Management , the respective compensation components and the compensation system , as well as to regularly review the compensation system on the basis of recommendations submitted by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee also discusses the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management . The Chairman of the Board of Management regularly attended the meetings of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee where the matters discussed did not relate to him personally ( including the succession planning for the CEO position ) . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee convened for four meetings . In each case , the meetings involved deliberations and the adoption of resolutions relating to the compensation of the Board of Management and the service contracts of Board of Management members , as well as compensation reporting . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee also dealt in depth with the succession planning for the CEO position and the conclusions drawn from the Compensation Report having been rejected by the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting , the target-setting and performance evaluation processes , and the Board of Management compensation system . Nominations Committee : This committee carries out preparatory work when an election of stockholder representatives to the Supervisory Board is to be held . It suggests suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting for election . The committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , who serves as its chairman , and three further stockholder representatives . The Nominations Committee convened twice in 2022 . At a meeting in January , it resolved \u2013 without the members in question voting on the resolution \u2013 to recommend to the Supervisory Board that Dr. Paul Achleitner , Dr. Norbert Bischofberger , and Colleen A. Goggins be proposed to the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting for reelection to the Supervisory Board . At a meeting in August , the committee resolved to recommend to the competent court that Kimberly Mathisen be appointed to succeed Dr. Fei-Fei Li , who stepped down from the Supervisory Board for medical reasons . Innovation Committee : The Innovation Committee is primarily concerned with the innovation strategy and innovation management , the strategy for the protection of intellectual property , and major research and development programs at Bayer . Within its area of responsibility , the committee advises and oversees management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions to be made . The Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven other members of the Supervisory Board , with parity of representation between stockholder and employee representatives . The meetings of the Innovation Committee are regularly attended by the Chairman of the Board of Management , as well as by further members of the Board of Management depending on the topics for discussion . Bayer Annual Report 2022 To our Stockholders Report of the Supervisory Board 20The Innovation Committee convened twice in 2022 . 1 . At its meeting in February , it dealt with the outlook for research , development and innovation in the Pharmaceuticals Division . 2 . At its meeting in May , the Innovation Committee dealt with transformative RNA-based strategies and discussed their significance for the individual divisions and for Leaps by Bayer . ESG Committee : Established at the beginning of 2022 , the ESG Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven other members , with parity of representation between stockholders and employees . It deals with sustainable corporate governance and the company \u2019 s business activities in the areas of environmental protection , social issues and corporate governance ( ESG ) . This mainly pertains to the way sustainability is incorporated into the business strategy ; the establishment of sustainability targets ; nonmandatory ESG reporting and the auditing thereof , if applicable ; opportunities and risks ; and organizational structures and processes in ESG areas , provided the Audit Committee is not already responsible for these matters . Within its area of responsibility , the committee advises and oversees the management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions to be made . The ESG Committee convened twice in 2022 : 1 . At its first meeting in February , the committee initially dealt with how it would go about its duties in the future . It then discussed Bayer \u2019 s sustainability performance in 2021 , as well as ESG benchmarks and controversies , and looked ahead to the ESG priorities for 2022 . 2 . At its meeting in August , the committee discussed the Bayer Sustainability Council \u2019 s focal topics for 2022 with the Co-Chairs of that body . The committee discussed the status of the sustainability targets , benchmarks and strategies , and dealt in depth with Bayer \u2019 s contribution to climate protection . In June , the Supervisory Board conducted a training session focused on digitalization and its impact on Bayer . This was the first of a three-part series of training sessions dealing with these issues . Corporate governance The Supervisory Board considered the principles of corporate governance at Bayer . In particular , at its December meeting , it dealt with the declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code and resolved to amend its rules of procedure . During Supervisory Board meetings , the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also summarized the dialogue he had engaged in with investors during investor discussions in September and October concerning Board of Management compensation and compensation reporting , as well as during a number of individual conversations . Disclosure of meeting participation on an individual basis The members \u2019 attendance rate in the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and the committees was 92 % . This was largely attributable to the long-term illness of one member of the Supervisory Board . The attendance rate of the other Supervisory Board members was just under 95 % . In view of the special circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of an endeavor to hold the meetings in more contemporary and sustainable formats , the meetings in 2022 took place not only as in-person meetings , but also as virtual meetings via video-conferencing or as in-person meetings with the option of participation in virtual form ( hybrid meetings ) . None of the meetings took place as a telephone conference call . The participation of the individual Supervisory Board members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is shown below : Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 41All major projects relating to tangible and intangible assets were analyzed to ascertain their taxonomy eligibility and classified in accordance with the activities of the EU taxonomy . The taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure was then reviewed using technical screening criteria for each activity to determine its taxonomy alignment . The detailed analyses were conducted by the departments of the respective business units to ensure correct allocation . Our relevant economic activities in 2022 can contribute to both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation . To avoid double counting within an indicator , taxonomy alignment was reviewed under the environmental objective climate change mitigation . We examined whether or not an economic activity contributes substantially to climate change mitigation based on the individual asset . To rule out significant harm being caused to other environmental objectives , we assessed the respective criteria at various levels . The criteria for climate change adaptation were assessed at site level , while the in some cases highly granular requirements for the other environmental objectives were examined at the individual asset level . Compliance with the minimum safeguards was examined at Group level , taking into account existing corporate policies and risk management processes with respect to human rights , compliance , anticorruption and other aspects . Following detailed analysis , we classified the noncapitalizable expenditure within the capital expenditure projects as immaterial . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 46// Innovation // Access to healthcare // Sustainable food supply // Product stewardship // Climate and environmental protection // Business ethics As part of our stakeholder engagement process , which is underpinned by a dedicated guideline , we approach key social and political players and seek dialogue from the outset in strategic decision-making processes regarding new projects such as investment projects and launches of new products . Respect for human rights Observing human rights is fundamental to the way we operate . We have documented our stance in a globally binding corporate policy entitled the Bayer Human Rights Policy . We further developed our corresponding strategy in 2022 and are currently updating our human rights policy . Human rights due diligence is a continuous process that we constantly adapt and improve . To specifically ensure respect for human rights in the value chain , we employ a due diligence approach based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises . We take steps to ensure human rights are respected both within our own company and along our entire value chain . Corporate policies , processes , and management and monitoring systems are in place to govern the implementation of human rights standards . We offer special training programs to continuously enhance employees \u2019 awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day activities . We launched a specific human rights training program in English in 2021 , and added an additional eight languages in 2022 . We also demand that our business partners , particularly our suppliers , fully observe human rights . We are a founding member of the UN Global Compact and respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the UN International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the UNGPs and a range of globally recognized declarations applicable to multinational corporations , including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy , and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) . As part of our risk management process , we conduct a risk analysis of the potentially adverse consequences of our operating activities for human rights . See the Opportunity and Risk Report for the risk status identified for this area in 2022 . We did not identify any potentially negative effects that were reportable under the CSR Directive Implementation Act . Donations and foundations Together with our network of leading partners , such as the Bayer foundations and other non-profits , we support social impact projects in the areas of health , nutrition , science and environment , and community engagement . Responding to disasters by providing humanitarian aid also plays a crucial role in our social commitment . Through our disaster relief programs , we support communities affected by natural disasters and public health crises . In 2022 , we provided around \u20ac37 million in charitable donations and social impact programs worldwide . In addition to the financial contributions , products costing around \u20ac16 million were donated to organizations in countries and communities in need . 66 % of our contributions ( cash and products ) went to low- and middle-income countries . In 2022 , we conducted more than 400 social projects worldwide with partner organizations , including the Bayer foundations ( Bayer Cares Foundation , Bayer Science & Education Foundation , Bayer Fund ( US ) and Bayer Foundation India ) , which generate an important impact for society in line with our vision and Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 47corporate purpose . Our donation activities in 2022 were mainly focused on humanitarian support in Ukraine and eastern European countries , as well as on our commitment to water access and the promotion of social innovations in agriculture . The contributions we make to support social causes \u2013 in the form of monetary , product or other in-kind donations \u2013 are governed by our global \u201c Corporate Charitable Giving Procedure , \u201d which was revised in late 2020 . It establishes clear criteria for recipient eligibility and project selection , and also sets forth the strategy we follow to generate long-term impact for society in line with our sustainability goals . Our charitable donations are recorded and approved centrally , which provides a transparent overview of our contributions to supporting social causes around the world . 1.2.3 Management Systems Planning and steering Economic planning and steering are conducted in line with the frameworks that are set for the Group and the divisions by the Board of Management in the course of the strategic planning process , and are translated into specific targets during operational planning . The planning and steering process is complemented by the continuous monitoring of business developments , with key financial and nonfinancial management and performance indicators being updated regularly . The following financial and nonfinancial indicators are employed to plan , steer and monitor the development of our business : Operational management indicators The main parameters in performance management at the operational level are sales growth , earnings and cash flow data , which also form the basis of short-term variable compensation ( STI ) . Sales growth is measured in terms of the change in sales after adjusting for currency and portfolio effects ( Fx & portfolio adj . ) in order to reflect the operational business development of the Group and the divisions . A key measure of profitability is the EBITDA margin before special items , which is the ratio of EBITDA before special items to sales . Another important profitability indicator for the Bayer Group is core earnings per share , which is the core net income divided by the weighted average number of shares . The free cash flow \u2013 an absolute indicator \u2013 shows the generation of freely available financial resources and also reflects the company \u2019 s financial strength and earning power . Strategic value management indicator : ROCE Return on capital employed ( ROCE ) is used as a strategic metric to measure the company \u2019 s operating profit after taxes in relation to the average capital employed . Comparing ROCE against the weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) on an annual basis illustrates the level of value creation . It also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) . Total shareholder return We aim to create shareholder value and thus deliver attractive returns for our stockholders . Total shareholder return , which is determined based on the change in the share price over the measurement period plus any dividends paid in the interim , also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.3 Focus on Innovation 48Sustainability We aim to improve people \u2019 s lives through our products . At the same time , we also endeavor to reduce our ecological footprint . We regulate and measure the attainment of our sustainability targets with the aid of nonfinancial key performance indicators ( KPIs ) . We take into account the number of people reached in the \u201c 100 million \u201d divisional targets and our greenhouse gas emissions as indicators for tracking the sustainable steering of our business and the reduction of our ecological footprint ( see A 1.2.1/2 ) . Our sustainability KPIs are also reflected in our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) program . Integrated management system We maintain a Group-wide integrated management system ( IMS ) , which is detailed in a corporate policy . The IMS provides a framework for all management systems at Bayer , ensuring compliance with the law and with internal and external requirements while also ensuring efficient ways of working . This is achieved through internal regulations and applicable processes involving clear roles and responsibilities . The IMS therefore plays a key role in safeguarding our company \u2019 s license to operate . 1.3 Focus on Innovation Our new solutions generate added value for our customers and society . Our activities focus on innovative products based on our research and development ( R & D ) competencies supplemented with new approaches in our process , service and business models . We also focus on social innovation to improve living conditions for people in developing countries and disadvantaged individuals in our society . The results of our research and development help us contribute to solving global challenges in medical care and agriculture . In addition to the strong innovative capabilities of our employees throughout the company , our efforts are driven by a broad open innovation network and the use of new , groundbreaking technologies with a particular focus on data science insights . Partnerships are integral to our innovation strategy , ensuring access to complementary technologies and expertise . We enter into strategic alliances with various partners such as universities , governmental agencies , start-ups , suppliers and other industrial companies . We maintain a global network of R & D locations , which employ roughly 16,200 Bayer employees . In 2022 , our research and development spend before special items amounted to \u20ac6,168 million ( 2021 : \u20ac5,326 million ) . Excellence in research and development The activities we pursue are aligned with the innovation strategies of our divisions and are aimed at improving human and plant health and sustainably safeguarding stable harvests in agriculture in step with our vision \u201c Health for all , hunger for none. \u201d We are increasingly employing data science methods in the R & D projects of our three divisions , strategically coordinated by the cross-divisional Digital Transformation Board ( DTB ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.4 Commitment to Employees 69In the Asia/Pacific region , we expanded our range of Redoxon\u2122 supplements in our Nutritionals category with the launch of Redoxon\u2122 Immunity+ product to strengthen the immune system and bone development for adults and children . We also expanded our Elevit\u2122 range in China , with the launch of an infant line containing calcium and vitamin D. In India , we extended our Supradyn\u2122 portfolio in the Nutritionals category with the launch of Supradyn\u2122 Immuno+ in a film-coated tablet format . In the United States , we launched Astepro\u2122 as an OTC product , following the FDA \u2019 s approval of the switch from Rx status in 2021 . Astepro\u2122 relieves nasal congestion , sneezing and a runny or itchy nose due to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies . It is the first and only steroid-free antihistamine nasal spray on the US market that is available over-the-counter for adults and children aged six and above that works in 30 minutes and lasts 24 hours . 1.4 Commitment to Employees Bayer \u2019 s business success is essentially built on the knowledge and commitment of our workforce . As an employer , we offer our employees attractive conditions and wide-ranging individual development opportunities . Alongside professional training , we focus on promoting a dialogue- and feedback-oriented culture based on trust , intentional inclusion , and respect for diversity and equality of opportunity , which is also summarized in our corporate policy entitled \u201c Fairness and Respect at Work. \u201d Our employees worldwide are trained to comply with these guidelines . We measure the engagement and satisfaction of our employees by means of systematic feedback discussions and regular employee surveys . Responsibility for the human resources strategy of the Bayer Group lies with the Board of Management , supported by Bayer \u2019 s Human Resources enabling function . The strategy is globally implemented within the scope of binding policies . For more than 10 years , Bayer \u2019 s LIFE values ( Leadership , Integrity , Flexibility and Efficiency ) have guided us in our activities . These stand for our values and leadership principles . Attributes define each value \u2019 s practical meaning and behaviors , serving as the sole reference for how employees work at Bayer . Employees at all Bayer sites around the world have the right to elect their own representatives . In 2022 , the working conditions for around 53 % ( 2021 : 54 % ) of our employees worldwide were governed by collective or company agreements . Employee data On December 31 , 2022 , we employed 101,369 people ( 2021 : 99,637 ) worldwide . In Germany , we had 22,569 ( 2021 : 23,116 ) employees , representing 22.3 % of the total Group workforce ( 2021 : 23.2 % ) . In 2022 , the Bayer Group hired 12,433 new employees ( accounting for 12.3 % of our workforce ) . On the reporting date , our employees had worked for the Bayer Group for an average of 11.0 years ( 2021 : 11.2 ) . Our workforce includes only a small number of employees on temporary contracts ( 3.4 % ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 115 results of internal and external assessments carried out at least once every five years by a qualified independent assessor . The most recent assessment was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2022 , yielding the best results possible . In addition , the fundamental suitability of the early warning system is assessed by the external auditor as an independent external body as part of its audit of the annual financial statements . Basic elements of the Bayer risk management system Risk culture and objectives of the risk management system All levels of the company are included in risk management in order to heighten the awareness and understanding of risks . This lays the foundation for a risk culture with independent , proactive and systematic risk management involving clearly defined roles and responsibilities , principles , standards , methods , tools and training measures . The aims of the risk management system are to achieve risk transparency , which also encompasses the early detection of risks , to support risk-based ( treatment ) decisions and to ensure compliance with legal requirements . ERM : risk management process Identification : Risks are identified by risk owners in the divisions and enabling functions . To help ensure we identify risks as comprehensively as possible , we maintain a risk universe that reflects the company \u2019 s potential risk categories . The Bayer Risk Universe , which is regularly updated , also expressly accounts for risks of a nonfinancial nature that are linked to our business activity or to our business relationships , products and services . Risks pursuant to the Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) Directive Implementation Act that relate to environmental , employee and social issues , human rights , corruption and bribery ( compliance ) are included as well . Further information on the nonfinancial statement can be found in the \u201c About this Report \u201d section . Assessment : Where possible , the identified risks are evaluated with regard to their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence using the following matrix . Risks are assessed on a net basis , taking into account the risk control measures in place to mitigate the potential impact and/or likelihood of occurrence .

See Note [ 30 ] to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group under \u201c Legal risks. \u201d The legal proceedings outlined there are those currently considered to involve material risks and do not represent an exhaustive list . The general risks to which we are potentially exposed include those in the areas of product liability , competition and antitrust law , anti-corruption law , patent law , tax law , data privacy and environmental protection , for example . Investigations of possible legal or regulatory violations may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties \u2013 including substantial monetary fines \u2013 and/or other adverse financial consequences . Payments may also need to be made under out-of-court settlements . These risks may harm our reputation and hamper our commercial success . We have established a global compliance management system to ensure the observance of laws and regulations . Glyphosate matter A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer \u2019 s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon Monsanto in the United States . Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto \u2019 s herbicides , including Roundup\u2122-branded products . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) and multiple myeloma , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Plaintiffs claim , inter alia , that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew , or should have known , of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users . Additional lawsuits are anticipated . The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and California . Cases pending in US federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) in the Northern District of California for common pre-trial management . In 2020 , Monsanto reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs , without admission of liability , to settle most of the current Roundup\u2122 litigation . As of February 1 , 2023 , Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial number of claims . As we now have greater visibility regarding the number and quality of claims made , we consider that , of the approximately 154,000 claims in total , approximately 109,000 have been settled or are not eligible for various reasons . The three adverse verdicts \u2013 Johnson , Hardeman and Pilliod \u2013 were not covered by the settlement . In both the Hardeman and Pilliod cases , following unsuccessful appeal procedures , the Company petitioned the Supreme Court for review . In June 2022 , the Supreme Court denied review of both Hardeman and Pilliod . There may be future cases in the Roundup\u2122 litigation ( or other unrelated actions ) that present the Supreme Court with preemption questions , and the Company will continue to review its legal options regarding further proceedings . Currently , in the Carson case , the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals \u2019 en banc full panel is considering plaintiff \u2019 s appeal of a Georgia federal district court \u2019 s grant of preemption in Monsanto \u2019 s favor . Oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for June 2023 . In the Schaffner case , the 3rd Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is considering Monsanto \u2019 s appeal of the MDL court \u2019 s denial of preemption . Briefing in the appeal is ongoing . In November 2022 , the jury in the Ferro ( St. Louis County , Missouri ) case issued a verdict in Monsanto \u2019 s favor , determining that Roundup\u2122 did not cause the plaintiff \u2019 s cancer . This is the sixth consecutive trial win for the Company . For costs to resolve potential future claims , Bayer has implemented corresponding accounting measures . As of December 31 , 2022 , Bayer had a provision of US $ 6.4 billion for the aforementioned settlements to resolve existing and future glyphosate claims . Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with these products . As of February 1 , 2023 , a total of 31 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup\u2122 had been served upon Bayer , including 11 seeking class action certification . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 132 Implementation status of the objectives The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience or an international background . The ages of the members of the Supervisory Board were relatively evenly spread across a range of 41 to 68 years as of December 31 , 2022 . One member of the Supervisory Board , Dr. Paul Achleitner , has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years . As such , the Supervisory Board does not consider him to be independent as defined in Section C.7 of the German Corporate Governance Code . However , the Supervisory Board does not harbor any concerns about Dr. Achleitner \u2019 s impartiality or any potential conflicts of interest . The Supervisory Board considers the stockholder representatives Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah , Horst Baier , Dr. Norbert Bischofberger , Ertharin Cousin , Colleen A. Goggins , Kimberly Mathisen , Alberto Weisser , Prof. Dr. Otmar Wiestler and Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann to be independent . The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is currently 45 % for the full Supervisory Board , 50 % for the employee representatives and 40 % for the stockholder representatives . Seven of the 20 members of the Supervisory Board are citizens of a country other than Germany . Numerous other members have many years of international business experience . The members of the Supervisory Board have also completed a whole range of vocational training and study courses . For the purposes of the qualification matrices below , the Supervisory Board primarily considers its members to possess expertise and experience in the corresponding areas if they have completed professional training in that field or have amassed many years of professional experience ( including several years as a member of the Supervisory Board or one of its respective committees ) . In the opinion of the Supervisory Board , the stockholder representatives have the following special expertise and experience , as well as the following independence status : A 4.1/1 Expertise and Experience of Shareholder Representatives on the Supervisory Board Interna-tionalbusinessexperience R & DAgri-culture/ foodHealth-care FinanceControlling/risk manage-ment HRGovern-ance/ compli-ance DigitalSustain-ability/ climate protec-tionIndepen-denceDr .

The transactions reported to Bayer AG in 2022 were duly published and can be viewed on the company \u2019 s website . 4.2 Compliance We define compliance as legally impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work , because the way they carry out their duties affects our company \u2019 s reputation . We do not tolerate any violation of applicable laws , codes of conduct or internal regulations . Compliance is essential for our long-term economic success . The following compliance principles apply throughout the Bayer Group : // We compete fairly in every market . // We act with integrity in all our business dealings . // We balance economic growth with ecological and social responsibility . // We observe trade controls that regulate our global business . // We safeguard equal opportunity in securities trading . // We keep accurate books and records . // We treat each other with fairness and respect . // We protect and respect intellectual property rights . // We act in Bayer \u2019 s best interest . // We protect and secure personal data . All employees are required to observe the compliance principles and to immediately report any violation of the Corporate Compliance Policy . Infringements are sanctioned . This applies in particular to managerial employees , who , for example , may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be subject to further disciplinary measures if violations have occurred in their sphere of responsibility that they could have prevented . Compliant and lawful conduct also factors into the performance evaluations of all managerial employees . The global compliance management system is steered by a central compliance organization within the Bayer Group that reports to the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board . The CFO is responsible for the compliance organization , while the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board oversees the effectiveness and further development of compliance within the Group . Potential compliance risks ( such as corruption ) are identified together with the operational units to ensure the systematic and preventive detection and assessment of risks . Potential risks are then entered into global databases that we use to develop suitable measures for specific processes , business activities or countries , for example . In addition , we assess our business partners according to risk criteria as we look to identify potential compliance risks . Adherence to the corporate compliance principles is among the subjects covered in audits conducted by Bayer \u2019 s Internal Audit and in the analyses and investigations by the legal and compliance organization . The heads of these organizations provide regular reports on the findings of the audits and analyses to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board , while summary reports are presented at least once a year . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.2 Compliance 135 Handling of suspected and actual compliance violations Suspected compliance violations can be reported \u2013 anonymously if desired and if permitted by respective national law \u2013 to a globally accessible compliance hotline that is operated by an independent service provider . Reports can be submitted either online or by telephone , with calls answered by trained , independent specialists . Those submitting reports can do so in their preferred language . The hotline is also accessible to the general public . In 2022 , the compliance organization received a total of 372 compliance reports in this way . In addition , there is a so-called \u201c speak-up inbox \u201d at Bayer for the submission of suspected compliance violations . Alternatively , suspected violations may also be reported to the local compliance function , Internal Audit , Human Resources or directly to the supervisor . Suspected compliance violations may also be reported by logging a so-called incident request on a platform . Moreover , the compliance function records and processes compliance violations discovered as part of monitoring activities . Compliance violations include all possible types of infringements of internal and external requirements and are systematically sanctioned . The action taken depends on factors including the gravity of the compliance violation and applicable law . Compliance training and communications activities We support all employees in acting with integrity and proactively avoiding potential violations by implementing Bayer-wide training measures that are tailored to target groups and based on identified needs and are flanked by communication campaigns . Supervisors and/or compliance managers can be consulted if there are any questions about lawful behavior . In 2022 , some 96.5 % of Bayer \u2019 s managerial employees worldwide completed at least one compliance training program . Overall , around 85.1 % of employees took part in the global web-based training program on conflicts of interest . Training measures on anti-corruption , the importance of openly expressing concerns ( \u201c speak up \u201d ) , antitrust law , conflicts of interest , fairness and respect in the workplace , foreign trade law compliance , product-related communication and data protection are fundamental elements of our compliance management system . Marketing compliance and applicability of accepted standards We are committed to responsible marketing practices . Our efforts in this regard are guided by our Corporate Compliance Policy , Anti-Corruption Policy and rules of conduct for responsible marketing , for example . We have also put in place directives and corporate policies that are designed to prevent price fixing and ensure data protection . Various industry codes such as those of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations ( IFPMA ) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ( EFPIA ) also apply in marketing and distribution . As regards the advertising of human pharmaceutical products , we comply with the IFPMA Code of Practice as the minimum global standard , along with the regulations set out in the applicable regional and national codes . Pharmaceuticals observes the applicable transparency rules ( e.g. , the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the United States ) and participates in voluntary programs such as the EFPIA Disclosure Code . Crop Science \u2019 s Product Stewardship Commitment applies to all products , services and technologies and is in alignment with the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations and the Code of Conduct on Plant Biotechnology issued by CropLife International , for example . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code 136 Lobbying Forming part of our commitment to ensuring transparent lobbying , our corporate policy entitled \u201c Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying \u201d sets out binding rules for our involvement in political matters and creates transparency in our interactions with the representatives of political institutions . As set out in this code of conduct , our company did not make any donations to political parties , politicians or candidates for political office in 2022 . Effective January 1 , 2022 , we abolished our applicable exemption for the United States meaning that we no longer donate directly as a company . However , one special aspect continues to apply : employees can make private donations in support of political nominees at the federal level through so-called \u201c political action committees. \u201d These voluntary donations are made only by employees , not the company . Decisions on how the donations made through Bayer \u2019 s political action committee , BAYERPAC , are allocated are made by an independent committee made up of employees . The allocation criteria it applies reflect societal challenges , among other factors . These donations are subject to narrow conditions and mandatory transparency measures . We also apply the Bayer Societal Engagement ( BASE ) principles , which are afforded the status of a corporate policy and serve to codify our standards and values to an even greater degree . 4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code The Bayer Group meets the requirements for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 289 b through e and 315 b and c of the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) . The relevant disclosures pertaining to the nonfinancial statement in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive Implementation Act ( CSR-RUG ) are integrated into the management report , with the GRI standards ( Section 289d HGB ) serving as a framework . The Supervisory Board fulfilled its auditing duty for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Section 170 , Paragraph 1 and Section 171 , Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 B Consolidated Financial StatementsNotes to the Statements of Financial Position 22630 . Legal risks As a global company with extensive business activities , the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks , particularly in the areas of product liability , competition and antitrust law , anticorruption , patent disputes , tax assessments and environmental matters . The outcome of any current or future proceedings can not normally be predicted . It is therefore possible that legal or regulatory judgments or future settlements could give rise to expenses that are not covered , or not fully covered , by insurers \u2019 compensation payments and could significantly affect our sales and earnings . Legal proceedings we currently consider to be material are outlined below . The legal proceedings referred to do not represent an exhaustive list . Product-related litigation Essure\u2122 : In the United States , a large number of lawsuits by users of Essure\u2122 , a medical device offering permanent birth control with a nonsurgical procedure , had been served upon Bayer . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries from the use of Essure\u2122 , including hysterectomy , perforation , pain , bleeding , weight gain , nickel sensitivity , depression and unwanted pregnancy , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Bayer reached agreements in principle with plaintiff law firms to resolve approximately 99 % of the nearly 40,000 total filed and unfiled US Essure\u2122 claims involving women who allege device-related injuries . The settlements include all of the jurisdictions with significant volumes of Essure\u2122 cases , including the state of California Joint Council Coordinated Proceedings ( JCCP ) and the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ( EDPA ) . Taking into account the payments already made , the remaining provision for settlements amounts to US $ 0.1 billion as of December 31 , 2022 . This includes an allowance for outstanding claims , and the company is in resolution discussions with counsel for the remaining plaintiffs . At the same time , we continue to support the safety and efficacy of the Essure\u2122 device and are prepared to vigorously defend it in litigation where no amicable resolution can be achieved . As of February 1 , 2023 , two Canadian lawsuits relating to Essure\u2122 seeking class action certification had been served upon Bayer . One of the proposed class actions has been certified . Certification in the other class action has been denied ; the decision has been appealed by plaintiffs . In addition , approximately 160 single-plaintiff claims have been served on Bayer . Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously . Class actions over neonicotinoids in Canada : Proposed class actions against Bayer were filed in Quebec and Ontario ( Canada ) concerning crop protection products containing the active substances imidacloprid and clothianidin ( neonicotinoids ) . The plaintiffs are honey producers , who have filed a proposed nationwide class action in Ontario and a Quebec-only class action in Quebec . Plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages and punitive damages and allege Bayer and another crop protection company were negligent in the design , development , marketing and sale of neonicotinoid pesticides . The proposed Ontario class action is in a very early procedural phase . In Quebec , a court certified a class proposed by plaintiffs in 2018 . Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously . Roundup\u2122 ( glyphosate ) : A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer \u2019 s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon Monsanto in the United States . Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto \u2019 s herbicides , including Roundup\u2122-branded products .

At the beginning of the year , it consisted of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and three other Supervisory Board members . In December , the Supervisory Board expanded this committee to six members while maintaining parity of representation and changed its name to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee ( previously : Human Resources Committee ) . In December , the Vice Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee were elected as additional members of this committee . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee prepares the personnel decisions of the full Supervisory Board , which resolves on appointments or dismissals of members of the Board of Management , and monitors the development of Board of Management compensation on an ongoing basis . The committee resolves on behalf of the Supervisory Board on the service contracts of the members of the Board of Management . However , it is the task of the full Supervisory Board to resolve on the total compensation of the individual members of the Board of Management , the respective compensation components and the compensation system , as well as to regularly review the compensation system on the basis of recommendations submitted by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee also discusses the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management . The Chairman of the Board of Management regularly attended the meetings of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee where the matters discussed did not relate to him personally ( including the succession planning for the CEO position ) . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee convened for four meetings . In each case , the meetings involved deliberations and the adoption of resolutions relating to the compensation of the Board of Management and the service contracts of Board of Management members , as well as compensation reporting . The Human Resources and Compensation Committee also dealt in depth with the succession planning for the CEO position and the conclusions drawn from the Compensation Report having been rejected by the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting , the target-setting and performance evaluation processes , and the Board of Management compensation system . Nominations Committee : This committee carries out preparatory work when an election of stockholder representatives to the Supervisory Board is to be held . It suggests suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting for election . The committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , who serves as its chairman , and three further stockholder representatives . The Nominations Committee convened twice in 2022 . At a meeting in January , it resolved \u2013 without the members in question voting on the resolution \u2013 to recommend to the Supervisory Board that Dr. Paul Achleitner , Dr. Norbert Bischofberger , and Colleen A. Goggins be proposed to the Annual Stockholders \u2019 Meeting for reelection to the Supervisory Board . At a meeting in August , the committee resolved to recommend to the competent court that Kimberly Mathisen be appointed to succeed Dr. Fei-Fei Li , who stepped down from the Supervisory Board for medical reasons . Innovation Committee : The Innovation Committee is primarily concerned with the innovation strategy and innovation management , the strategy for the protection of intellectual property , and major research and development programs at Bayer . Within its area of responsibility , the committee advises and oversees management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions to be made . The Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven other members of the Supervisory Board , with parity of representation between stockholder and employee representatives . The meetings of the Innovation Committee are regularly attended by the Chairman of the Board of Management , as well as by further members of the Board of Management depending on the topics for discussion . Bayer Annual Report 2022 To our Stockholders Report of the Supervisory Board 20The Innovation Committee convened twice in 2022 . 1 . At its meeting in February , it dealt with the outlook for research , development and innovation in the Pharmaceuticals Division . 2 . At its meeting in May , the Innovation Committee dealt with transformative RNA-based strategies and discussed their significance for the individual divisions and for Leaps by Bayer . ESG Committee : Established at the beginning of 2022 , the ESG Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and seven other members , with parity of representation between stockholders and employees . It deals with sustainable corporate governance and the company \u2019 s business activities in the areas of environmental protection , social issues and corporate governance ( ESG ) . This mainly pertains to the way sustainability is incorporated into the business strategy ; the establishment of sustainability targets ; nonmandatory ESG reporting and the auditing thereof , if applicable ; opportunities and risks ; and organizational structures and processes in ESG areas , provided the Audit Committee is not already responsible for these matters . Within its area of responsibility , the committee advises and oversees the management and prepares any Supervisory Board decisions to be made . The ESG Committee convened twice in 2022 : 1 . At its first meeting in February , the committee initially dealt with how it would go about its duties in the future . It then discussed Bayer \u2019 s sustainability performance in 2021 , as well as ESG benchmarks and controversies , and looked ahead to the ESG priorities for 2022 . 2 . At its meeting in August , the committee discussed the Bayer Sustainability Council \u2019 s focal topics for 2022 with the Co-Chairs of that body . The committee discussed the status of the sustainability targets , benchmarks and strategies , and dealt in depth with Bayer \u2019 s contribution to climate protection . In June , the Supervisory Board conducted a training session focused on digitalization and its impact on Bayer . This was the first of a three-part series of training sessions dealing with these issues . Corporate governance The Supervisory Board considered the principles of corporate governance at Bayer . In particular , at its December meeting , it dealt with the declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code and resolved to amend its rules of procedure . During Supervisory Board meetings , the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also summarized the dialogue he had engaged in with investors during investor discussions in September and October concerning Board of Management compensation and compensation reporting , as well as during a number of individual conversations . Disclosure of meeting participation on an individual basis The members \u2019 attendance rate in the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and the committees was 92 % . This was largely attributable to the long-term illness of one member of the Supervisory Board . The attendance rate of the other Supervisory Board members was just under 95 % . In view of the special circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of an endeavor to hold the meetings in more contemporary and sustainable formats , the meetings in 2022 took place not only as in-person meetings , but also as virtual meetings via video-conferencing or as in-person meetings with the option of participation in virtual form ( hybrid meetings ) . None of the meetings took place as a telephone conference call . The participation of the individual Supervisory Board members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is shown below : Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 41All major projects relating to tangible and intangible assets were analyzed to ascertain their taxonomy eligibility and classified in accordance with the activities of the EU taxonomy . The taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure was then reviewed using technical screening criteria for each activity to determine its taxonomy alignment . The detailed analyses were conducted by the departments of the respective business units to ensure correct allocation . Our relevant economic activities in 2022 can contribute to both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation . To avoid double counting within an indicator , taxonomy alignment was reviewed under the environmental objective climate change mitigation . We examined whether or not an economic activity contributes substantially to climate change mitigation based on the individual asset . To rule out significant harm being caused to other environmental objectives , we assessed the respective criteria at various levels . The criteria for climate change adaptation were assessed at site level , while the in some cases highly granular requirements for the other environmental objectives were examined at the individual asset level . Compliance with the minimum safeguards was examined at Group level , taking into account existing corporate policies and risk management processes with respect to human rights , compliance , anticorruption and other aspects . Following detailed analysis , we classified the noncapitalizable expenditure within the capital expenditure projects as immaterial . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 46// Innovation // Access to healthcare // Sustainable food supply // Product stewardship // Climate and environmental protection // Business ethics As part of our stakeholder engagement process , which is underpinned by a dedicated guideline , we approach key social and political players and seek dialogue from the outset in strategic decision-making processes regarding new projects such as investment projects and launches of new products . Respect for human rights Observing human rights is fundamental to the way we operate . We have documented our stance in a globally binding corporate policy entitled the Bayer Human Rights Policy . We further developed our corresponding strategy in 2022 and are currently updating our human rights policy . Human rights due diligence is a continuous process that we constantly adapt and improve . To specifically ensure respect for human rights in the value chain , we employ a due diligence approach based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises . We take steps to ensure human rights are respected both within our own company and along our entire value chain . Corporate policies , processes , and management and monitoring systems are in place to govern the implementation of human rights standards . We offer special training programs to continuously enhance employees \u2019 awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day activities . We launched a specific human rights training program in English in 2021 , and added an additional eight languages in 2022 . We also demand that our business partners , particularly our suppliers , fully observe human rights . We are a founding member of the UN Global Compact and respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the UN International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the UNGPs and a range of globally recognized declarations applicable to multinational corporations , including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy , and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) . As part of our risk management process , we conduct a risk analysis of the potentially adverse consequences of our operating activities for human rights . See the Opportunity and Risk Report for the risk status identified for this area in 2022 . We did not identify any potentially negative effects that were reportable under the CSR Directive Implementation Act . Donations and foundations Together with our network of leading partners , such as the Bayer foundations and other non-profits , we support social impact projects in the areas of health , nutrition , science and environment , and community engagement . Responding to disasters by providing humanitarian aid also plays a crucial role in our social commitment . Through our disaster relief programs , we support communities affected by natural disasters and public health crises . In 2022 , we provided around \u20ac37 million in charitable donations and social impact programs worldwide . In addition to the financial contributions , products costing around \u20ac16 million were donated to organizations in countries and communities in need . 66 % of our contributions ( cash and products ) went to low- and middle-income countries . In 2022 , we conducted more than 400 social projects worldwide with partner organizations , including the Bayer foundations ( Bayer Cares Foundation , Bayer Science & Education Foundation , Bayer Fund ( US ) and Bayer Foundation India ) , which generate an important impact for society in line with our vision and Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.2 Strategy and Management 47corporate purpose . Our donation activities in 2022 were mainly focused on humanitarian support in Ukraine and eastern European countries , as well as on our commitment to water access and the promotion of social innovations in agriculture . The contributions we make to support social causes \u2013 in the form of monetary , product or other in-kind donations \u2013 are governed by our global \u201c Corporate Charitable Giving Procedure , \u201d which was revised in late 2020 . It establishes clear criteria for recipient eligibility and project selection , and also sets forth the strategy we follow to generate long-term impact for society in line with our sustainability goals . Our charitable donations are recorded and approved centrally , which provides a transparent overview of our contributions to supporting social causes around the world . 1.2.3 Management Systems Planning and steering Economic planning and steering are conducted in line with the frameworks that are set for the Group and the divisions by the Board of Management in the course of the strategic planning process , and are translated into specific targets during operational planning . The planning and steering process is complemented by the continuous monitoring of business developments , with key financial and nonfinancial management and performance indicators being updated regularly . The following financial and nonfinancial indicators are employed to plan , steer and monitor the development of our business : Operational management indicators The main parameters in performance management at the operational level are sales growth , earnings and cash flow data , which also form the basis of short-term variable compensation ( STI ) . Sales growth is measured in terms of the change in sales after adjusting for currency and portfolio effects ( Fx & portfolio adj . ) in order to reflect the operational business development of the Group and the divisions . A key measure of profitability is the EBITDA margin before special items , which is the ratio of EBITDA before special items to sales . Another important profitability indicator for the Bayer Group is core earnings per share , which is the core net income divided by the weighted average number of shares . The free cash flow \u2013 an absolute indicator \u2013 shows the generation of freely available financial resources and also reflects the company \u2019 s financial strength and earning power . Strategic value management indicator : ROCE Return on capital employed ( ROCE ) is used as a strategic metric to measure the company \u2019 s operating profit after taxes in relation to the average capital employed . Comparing ROCE against the weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) on an annual basis illustrates the level of value creation . It also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) . Total shareholder return We aim to create shareholder value and thus deliver attractive returns for our stockholders . Total shareholder return , which is determined based on the change in the share price over the measurement period plus any dividends paid in the interim , also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.3 Focus on Innovation 48Sustainability We aim to improve people \u2019 s lives through our products . At the same time , we also endeavor to reduce our ecological footprint . We regulate and measure the attainment of our sustainability targets with the aid of nonfinancial key performance indicators ( KPIs ) . We take into account the number of people reached in the \u201c 100 million \u201d divisional targets and our greenhouse gas emissions as indicators for tracking the sustainable steering of our business and the reduction of our ecological footprint ( see A 1.2.1/2 ) . Our sustainability KPIs are also reflected in our long-term stock-based cash compensation ( LTI ) program . Integrated management system We maintain a Group-wide integrated management system ( IMS ) , which is detailed in a corporate policy . The IMS provides a framework for all management systems at Bayer , ensuring compliance with the law and with internal and external requirements while also ensuring efficient ways of working . This is achieved through internal regulations and applicable processes involving clear roles and responsibilities . The IMS therefore plays a key role in safeguarding our company \u2019 s license to operate . 1.3 Focus on Innovation Our new solutions generate added value for our customers and society . Our activities focus on innovative products based on our research and development ( R & D ) competencies supplemented with new approaches in our process , service and business models . We also focus on social innovation to improve living conditions for people in developing countries and disadvantaged individuals in our society . The results of our research and development help us contribute to solving global challenges in medical care and agriculture . In addition to the strong innovative capabilities of our employees throughout the company , our efforts are driven by a broad open innovation network and the use of new , groundbreaking technologies with a particular focus on data science insights . Partnerships are integral to our innovation strategy , ensuring access to complementary technologies and expertise . We enter into strategic alliances with various partners such as universities , governmental agencies , start-ups , suppliers and other industrial companies . We maintain a global network of R & D locations , which employ roughly 16,200 Bayer employees . In 2022 , our research and development spend before special items amounted to \u20ac6,168 million ( 2021 : \u20ac5,326 million ) . Excellence in research and development The activities we pursue are aligned with the innovation strategies of our divisions and are aimed at improving human and plant health and sustainably safeguarding stable harvests in agriculture in step with our vision \u201c Health for all , hunger for none. \u201d We are increasingly employing data science methods in the R & D projects of our three divisions , strategically coordinated by the cross-divisional Digital Transformation Board ( DTB ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report1.4 Commitment to Employees 69In the Asia/Pacific region , we expanded our range of Redoxon\u2122 supplements in our Nutritionals category with the launch of Redoxon\u2122 Immunity+ product to strengthen the immune system and bone development for adults and children . We also expanded our Elevit\u2122 range in China , with the launch of an infant line containing calcium and vitamin D. In India , we extended our Supradyn\u2122 portfolio in the Nutritionals category with the launch of Supradyn\u2122 Immuno+ in a film-coated tablet format . In the United States , we launched Astepro\u2122 as an OTC product , following the FDA \u2019 s approval of the switch from Rx status in 2021 . Astepro\u2122 relieves nasal congestion , sneezing and a runny or itchy nose due to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies . It is the first and only steroid-free antihistamine nasal spray on the US market that is available over-the-counter for adults and children aged six and above that works in 30 minutes and lasts 24 hours . 1.4 Commitment to Employees Bayer \u2019 s business success is essentially built on the knowledge and commitment of our workforce . As an employer , we offer our employees attractive conditions and wide-ranging individual development opportunities . Alongside professional training , we focus on promoting a dialogue- and feedback-oriented culture based on trust , intentional inclusion , and respect for diversity and equality of opportunity , which is also summarized in our corporate policy entitled \u201c Fairness and Respect at Work. \u201d Our employees worldwide are trained to comply with these guidelines . We measure the engagement and satisfaction of our employees by means of systematic feedback discussions and regular employee surveys . Responsibility for the human resources strategy of the Bayer Group lies with the Board of Management , supported by Bayer \u2019 s Human Resources enabling function . The strategy is globally implemented within the scope of binding policies . For more than 10 years , Bayer \u2019 s LIFE values ( Leadership , Integrity , Flexibility and Efficiency ) have guided us in our activities . These stand for our values and leadership principles . Attributes define each value \u2019 s practical meaning and behaviors , serving as the sole reference for how employees work at Bayer . Employees at all Bayer sites around the world have the right to elect their own representatives . In 2022 , the working conditions for around 53 % ( 2021 : 54 % ) of our employees worldwide were governed by collective or company agreements . Employee data On December 31 , 2022 , we employed 101,369 people ( 2021 : 99,637 ) worldwide . In Germany , we had 22,569 ( 2021 : 23,116 ) employees , representing 22.3 % of the total Group workforce ( 2021 : 23.2 % ) . In 2022 , the Bayer Group hired 12,433 new employees ( accounting for 12.3 % of our workforce ) . On the reporting date , our employees had worked for the Bayer Group for an average of 11.0 years ( 2021 : 11.2 ) . Our workforce includes only a small number of employees on temporary contracts ( 3.4 % ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 115 results of internal and external assessments carried out at least once every five years by a qualified independent assessor . The most recent assessment was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2022 , yielding the best results possible . In addition , the fundamental suitability of the early warning system is assessed by the external auditor as an independent external body as part of its audit of the annual financial statements . Basic elements of the Bayer risk management system Risk culture and objectives of the risk management system All levels of the company are included in risk management in order to heighten the awareness and understanding of risks . This lays the foundation for a risk culture with independent , proactive and systematic risk management involving clearly defined roles and responsibilities , principles , standards , methods , tools and training measures . The aims of the risk management system are to achieve risk transparency , which also encompasses the early detection of risks , to support risk-based ( treatment ) decisions and to ensure compliance with legal requirements . ERM : risk management process Identification : Risks are identified by risk owners in the divisions and enabling functions . To help ensure we identify risks as comprehensively as possible , we maintain a risk universe that reflects the company \u2019 s potential risk categories . The Bayer Risk Universe , which is regularly updated , also expressly accounts for risks of a nonfinancial nature that are linked to our business activity or to our business relationships , products and services . Risks pursuant to the Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) Directive Implementation Act that relate to environmental , employee and social issues , human rights , corruption and bribery ( compliance ) are included as well . Further information on the nonfinancial statement can be found in the \u201c About this Report \u201d section . Assessment : Where possible , the identified risks are evaluated with regard to their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence using the following matrix . Risks are assessed on a net basis , taking into account the risk control measures in place to mitigate the potential impact and/or likelihood of occurrence .

See Note [ 30 ] to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group under \u201c Legal risks. \u201d The legal proceedings outlined there are those currently considered to involve material risks and do not represent an exhaustive list . The general risks to which we are potentially exposed include those in the areas of product liability , competition and antitrust law , anti-corruption law , patent law , tax law , data privacy and environmental protection , for example . Investigations of possible legal or regulatory violations may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties \u2013 including substantial monetary fines \u2013 and/or other adverse financial consequences . Payments may also need to be made under out-of-court settlements . These risks may harm our reputation and hamper our commercial success . We have established a global compliance management system to ensure the observance of laws and regulations . Glyphosate matter A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer \u2019 s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon Monsanto in the United States . Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto \u2019 s herbicides , including Roundup\u2122-branded products . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) and multiple myeloma , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Plaintiffs claim , inter alia , that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew , or should have known , of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users . Additional lawsuits are anticipated . The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and California . Cases pending in US federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) in the Northern District of California for common pre-trial management . In 2020 , Monsanto reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs , without admission of liability , to settle most of the current Roundup\u2122 litigation . As of February 1 , 2023 , Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial number of claims . As we now have greater visibility regarding the number and quality of claims made , we consider that , of the approximately 154,000 claims in total , approximately 109,000 have been settled or are not eligible for various reasons . The three adverse verdicts \u2013 Johnson , Hardeman and Pilliod \u2013 were not covered by the settlement . In both the Hardeman and Pilliod cases , following unsuccessful appeal procedures , the Company petitioned the Supreme Court for review . In June 2022 , the Supreme Court denied review of both Hardeman and Pilliod . There may be future cases in the Roundup\u2122 litigation ( or other unrelated actions ) that present the Supreme Court with preemption questions , and the Company will continue to review its legal options regarding further proceedings . Currently , in the Carson case , the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals \u2019 en banc full panel is considering plaintiff \u2019 s appeal of a Georgia federal district court \u2019 s grant of preemption in Monsanto \u2019 s favor . Oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for June 2023 . In the Schaffner case , the 3rd Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is considering Monsanto \u2019 s appeal of the MDL court \u2019 s denial of preemption . Briefing in the appeal is ongoing . In November 2022 , the jury in the Ferro ( St. Louis County , Missouri ) case issued a verdict in Monsanto \u2019 s favor , determining that Roundup\u2122 did not cause the plaintiff \u2019 s cancer . This is the sixth consecutive trial win for the Company . For costs to resolve potential future claims , Bayer has implemented corresponding accounting measures . As of December 31 , 2022 , Bayer had a provision of US $ 6.4 billion for the aforementioned settlements to resolve existing and future glyphosate claims . Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with these products . As of February 1 , 2023 , a total of 31 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup\u2122 had been served upon Bayer , including 11 seeking class action certification . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 132 Implementation status of the objectives The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience or an international background . The ages of the members of the Supervisory Board were relatively evenly spread across a range of 41 to 68 years as of December 31 , 2022 . One member of the Supervisory Board , Dr. Paul Achleitner , has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years . As such , the Supervisory Board does not consider him to be independent as defined in Section C.7 of the German Corporate Governance Code . However , the Supervisory Board does not harbor any concerns about Dr. Achleitner \u2019 s impartiality or any potential conflicts of interest . The Supervisory Board considers the stockholder representatives Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah , Horst Baier , Dr. Norbert Bischofberger , Ertharin Cousin , Colleen A. Goggins , Kimberly Mathisen , Alberto Weisser , Prof. Dr. Otmar Wiestler and Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann to be independent . The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is currently 45 % for the full Supervisory Board , 50 % for the employee representatives and 40 % for the stockholder representatives . Seven of the 20 members of the Supervisory Board are citizens of a country other than Germany . Numerous other members have many years of international business experience . The members of the Supervisory Board have also completed a whole range of vocational training and study courses . For the purposes of the qualification matrices below , the Supervisory Board primarily considers its members to possess expertise and experience in the corresponding areas if they have completed professional training in that field or have amassed many years of professional experience ( including several years as a member of the Supervisory Board or one of its respective committees ) . In the opinion of the Supervisory Board , the stockholder representatives have the following special expertise and experience , as well as the following independence status : A 4.1/1 Expertise and Experience of Shareholder Representatives on the Supervisory Board Interna-tionalbusinessexperience R & DAgri-culture/ foodHealth-care FinanceControlling/risk manage-ment HRGovern-ance/ compli-ance DigitalSustain-ability/ climate protec-tionIndepen-denceDr .

Norbert Winkeljohann , Chairman of the Supervisory Board and a member of the Audit Committee , has special expertise in the field of auditing . This expertise is based on his training as an auditor , academic work in this field and longstanding experience as an external auditor for publicly listed companies and as a Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.2 Compliance 134 Further information Securities transactions by members of governance bodies Members of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board and persons with whom they have close relationships are legally obligated to report own-account transactions in shares or debt securities of Bayer AG , associated derivatives or other associated financial instruments to Bayer AG and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) as soon as the total volume of transactions made by a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board , or a person with whom they have a close relationship , has reached the \u20ac20,000 threshold within a calendar year . The transactions reported to Bayer AG in 2022 were duly published and can be viewed on the company \u2019 s website . 4.2 Compliance We define compliance as legally impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work , because the way they carry out their duties affects our company \u2019 s reputation . We do not tolerate any violation of applicable laws , codes of conduct or internal regulations . Compliance is essential for our long-term economic success . The following compliance principles apply throughout the Bayer Group : // We compete fairly in every market . // We act with integrity in all our business dealings . // We balance economic growth with ecological and social responsibility . // We observe trade controls that regulate our global business . // We safeguard equal opportunity in securities trading . // We keep accurate books and records . // We treat each other with fairness and respect . // We protect and respect intellectual property rights . // We act in Bayer \u2019 s best interest . // We protect and secure personal data . All employees are required to observe the compliance principles and to immediately report any violation of the Corporate Compliance Policy . Infringements are sanctioned . This applies in particular to managerial employees , who , for example , may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be subject to further disciplinary measures if violations have occurred in their sphere of responsibility that they could have prevented . Compliant and lawful conduct also factors into the performance evaluations of all managerial employees . The global compliance management system is steered by a central compliance organization within the Bayer Group that reports to the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board . The CFO is responsible for the compliance organization , while the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board oversees the effectiveness and further development of compliance within the Group . Potential compliance risks ( such as corruption ) are identified together with the operational units to ensure the systematic and preventive detection and assessment of risks . Potential risks are then entered into global databases that we use to develop suitable measures for specific processes , business activities or countries , for example . In addition , we assess our business partners according to risk criteria as we look to identify potential compliance risks . Adherence to the corporate compliance principles is among the subjects covered in audits conducted by Bayer \u2019 s Internal Audit and in the analyses and investigations by the legal and compliance organization . The heads of these organizations provide regular reports on the findings of the audits and analyses to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board , while summary reports are presented at least once a year . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.2 Compliance 135 Handling of suspected and actual compliance violations Suspected compliance violations can be reported \u2013 anonymously if desired and if permitted by respective national law \u2013 to a globally accessible compliance hotline that is operated by an independent service provider . Reports can be submitted either online or by telephone , with calls answered by trained , independent specialists . Those submitting reports can do so in their preferred language . The hotline is also accessible to the general public . In 2022 , the compliance organization received a total of 372 compliance reports in this way . In addition , there is a so-called \u201c speak-up inbox \u201d at Bayer for the submission of suspected compliance violations . Alternatively , suspected violations may also be reported to the local compliance function , Internal Audit , Human Resources or directly to the supervisor . Suspected compliance violations may also be reported by logging a so-called incident request on a platform . Moreover , the compliance function records and processes compliance violations discovered as part of monitoring activities . Compliance violations include all possible types of infringements of internal and external requirements and are systematically sanctioned . The action taken depends on factors including the gravity of the compliance violation and applicable law . Compliance training and communications activities We support all employees in acting with integrity and proactively avoiding potential violations by implementing Bayer-wide training measures that are tailored to target groups and based on identified needs and are flanked by communication campaigns . Supervisors and/or compliance managers can be consulted if there are any questions about lawful behavior . In 2022 , some 96.5 % of Bayer \u2019 s managerial employees worldwide completed at least one compliance training program . Overall , around 85.1 % of employees took part in the global web-based training program on conflicts of interest . Training measures on anti-corruption , the importance of openly expressing concerns ( \u201c speak up \u201d ) , antitrust law , conflicts of interest , fairness and respect in the workplace , foreign trade law compliance , product-related communication and data protection are fundamental elements of our compliance management system . Marketing compliance and applicability of accepted standards We are committed to responsible marketing practices . Our efforts in this regard are guided by our Corporate Compliance Policy , Anti-Corruption Policy and rules of conduct for responsible marketing , for example . We have also put in place directives and corporate policies that are designed to prevent price fixing and ensure data protection . Various industry codes such as those of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations ( IFPMA ) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ( EFPIA ) also apply in marketing and distribution . As regards the advertising of human pharmaceutical products , we comply with the IFPMA Code of Practice as the minimum global standard , along with the regulations set out in the applicable regional and national codes . Pharmaceuticals observes the applicable transparency rules ( e.g. , the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the United States ) and participates in voluntary programs such as the EFPIA Disclosure Code . Crop Science \u2019 s Product Stewardship Commitment applies to all products , services and technologies and is in alignment with the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations and the Code of Conduct on Plant Biotechnology issued by CropLife International , for example . Bayer Annual Report 2022 A Combined Management Report4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code 136 Lobbying Forming part of our commitment to ensuring transparent lobbying , our corporate policy entitled \u201c Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying \u201d sets out binding rules for our involvement in political matters and creates transparency in our interactions with the representatives of political institutions . As set out in this code of conduct , our company did not make any donations to political parties , politicians or candidates for political office in 2022 . Effective January 1 , 2022 , we abolished our applicable exemption for the United States meaning that we no longer donate directly as a company . However , one special aspect continues to apply : employees can make private donations in support of political nominees at the federal level through so-called \u201c political action committees. \u201d These voluntary donations are made only by employees , not the company . Decisions on how the donations made through Bayer \u2019 s political action committee , BAYERPAC , are allocated are made by an independent committee made up of employees . The allocation criteria it applies reflect societal challenges , among other factors . These donations are subject to narrow conditions and mandatory transparency measures . We also apply the Bayer Societal Engagement ( BASE ) principles , which are afforded the status of a corporate policy and serve to codify our standards and values to an even greater degree . 4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code The Bayer Group meets the requirements for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 289 b through e and 315 b and c of the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) . The relevant disclosures pertaining to the nonfinancial statement in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive Implementation Act ( CSR-RUG ) are integrated into the management report , with the GRI standards ( Section 289d HGB ) serving as a framework . The Supervisory Board fulfilled its auditing duty for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Section 170 , Paragraph 1 and Section 171 , Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) . Bayer Annual Report 2022 B Consolidated Financial StatementsNotes to the Statements of Financial Position 22630 . Legal risks As a global company with extensive business activities , the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks , particularly in the areas of product liability , competition and antitrust law , anticorruption , patent disputes , tax assessments and environmental matters . The outcome of any current or future proceedings can not normally be predicted . It is therefore possible that legal or regulatory judgments or future settlements could give rise to expenses that are not covered , or not fully covered , by insurers \u2019 compensation payments and could significantly affect our sales and earnings . Legal proceedings we currently consider to be material are outlined below . The legal proceedings referred to do not represent an exhaustive list . Product-related litigation Essure\u2122 : In the United States , a large number of lawsuits by users of Essure\u2122 , a medical device offering permanent birth control with a nonsurgical procedure , had been served upon Bayer . Plaintiffs allege personal injuries from the use of Essure\u2122 , including hysterectomy , perforation , pain , bleeding , weight gain , nickel sensitivity , depression and unwanted pregnancy , and seek compensatory and punitive damages . Bayer reached agreements in principle with plaintiff law firms to resolve approximately 99 % of the nearly 40,000 total filed and unfiled US Essure\u2122 claims involving women who allege device-related injuries . The settlements include all of the jurisdictions with significant volumes of Essure\u2122 cases , including the state of California Joint Council Coordinated Proceedings ( JCCP ) and the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ( EDPA ) . Taking into account the payments already made , the remaining provision for settlements amounts to US $ 0.1 billion as of December 31 , 2022 . This includes an allowance for outstanding claims , and the company is in resolution discussions with counsel for the remaining plaintiffs . At the same time , we continue to support the safety and efficacy of the Essure\u2122 device and are prepared to vigorously defend it in litigation where no amicable resolution can be achieved . As of February 1 , 2023 , two Canadian lawsuits relating to Essure\u2122 seeking class action certification had been served upon Bayer . One of the proposed class actions has been certified . Certification in the other class action has been denied ; the decision has been appealed by plaintiffs . In addition , approximately 160 single-plaintiff claims have been served on Bayer . Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously . Class actions over neonicotinoids in Canada : Proposed class actions against Bayer were filed in Quebec and Ontario ( Canada ) concerning crop protection products containing the active substances imidacloprid and clothianidin ( neonicotinoids ) . The plaintiffs are honey producers , who have filed a proposed nationwide class action in Ontario and a Quebec-only class action in Quebec . Plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages and punitive damages and allege Bayer and another crop protection company were negligent in the design , development , marketing and sale of neonicotinoid pesticides . The proposed Ontario class action is in a very early procedural phase . In Quebec , a court certified a class proposed by plaintiffs in 2018 . Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously . Roundup\u2122 ( glyphosate ) : A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer \u2019 s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon Monsanto in the United States . Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto \u2019 s herbicides , including Roundup\u2122-branded products .

Additional lawsuits are anticipated . The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and California . Cases pending in US federal courts have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) in the Northern District of California for common pre-trial management . In 2020 , Monsanto reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs , without admission of liability , to settle most of the current Roundup\u2122 litigation .

These include aspects\nregarding the environment, employees, society, human rights, and anti-corruption. The following\nsections of the Annual Report constitute the Combined Non-financial Statement (NFS) for the\nBeiersdorf Group (Consumer and tesa Business Segments) and Beiersdorf AG, as defined under\nsections 315b and 289b of the Handelsgesetzbuch (German Commercial Code, HGB).\nFurthermore, both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments publish separate sustainability reports\nwhich provide further information on their respective sustainability activities and projects.\nApplication of international reporting frameworks\nDue to the different materiality requirements set out in the GRI Standards, United Nations Global\nCompact (UNGC), and Germany\u2019s CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), neither the\nBeiersdorf Group nor Beiersdorf AG applied any international frameworks in accordance with section\n315c(3) of the HGB in conjunction with section 289d of the HGB to prepare the Non-financial Statement.\nThe Consumer Business Segment, however, follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards in\nits broader sustainability reporting and publishes a separate GRI index.\nBoth business segments are United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) members and report on their\nachievements and measures taken in the reporting period in order to implement the ten princi-\nples of the UNGC in the areas of human rights, working conditions, environmental protection, and\nanti-corruption. This Non-financial Statement systematically and comprehensively fulfills the UNGC\nCommunication on Progress (CoP) requirements for the Beiersdorf Group.\nMaterial non-financial topics for the business segments\nBoth business segments conduct materiality analyses to strategically identify and review sustainability\ntopics. In the Consumer Business Segment, such an analysis was last carried out in 2021. The f ollowing\nmaterial topics were identified during this process: Climate protection, circular economy, sustaina-\nble land use and biodiversity, sustainable use of water, diversity and inclusion, education and training,\nemployer attractiveness, occupational health and safety, safeguarding human rights, community\nengagement, compliance and business ethics, and product safety.\nThe tesa Business Segment last updated its materiality matrix with members of relevant specialist\ndepartments in 2020. The material non-financial topics identified are climate and energy, product\nsustainability, resource efficiency, water, employee development, diversity and equal opportuni-\nties, occupational health and safety, human rights, prevention of anticompetitive behavior, and\nproduct safety. For an overview of all material non-financial topics relating to the Consumer and\ntesa Business Segments, together with section and page references, please refer to our index to\nthe Non-financial Statement.\nStatement scope\nDisclosures on the material NFS topics are mainly provided separately for the tesa and Consumer\nBusiness Segments. In principle, all information is reported jointly for the Beiersdorf Group and\nBeiersdorf AG. Key figures that are collected separately for Beiersdorf AG are listed in the table\n\u201cRelevant Key Figures for the Non-financial Statement of the Beiersdorf AG\u201d.\n88 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\npose a threat to water are emptied, refilled, and stored only in areas that are equipped with appropriate\nretention tanks. We use equipment to measure turbidity and solvent concentration to ensure that con-\ntaminated surface water is not discharged into the sewer system. We have emergency plans in place\nto determine the exact course of action in the event of a leakage of substances hazardous to water. All\nthese measures are regularly reviewed in our external ISO 14001 audits and are a precondition for a\nsuccessful audit result.\nEmployees\nOur employees play a key role in the sustainable development of our company. Their expertise,\nskills, and commitment ensure that we remain competitive and innovative. Our goal is to create an\nattractive, inclusive workplace that recognizes the individual performance and actively promotes the\npotential of a diverse workforce.\nConsumer\nTraining and education\nThe changes in our working world require an agile and dynamic approach to work and thus a high\ndegree of flexibility and willingness to learn. This makes it all the more important to foster our\nemployees\u2019 personal strengths and invest in their long-term development. To this end, we offer\ncomprehensive training and development opportunities that also support lifelong learning.\nMore information on the key topic of training and development, as well as knowledge and learning,\ncan be found in the Combined Management Report in the section entitled \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d.\nEmployer attractiveness\nWe want to be an attractive employer for our employees and offer them a safe, attractive, and\ninclusive working environment where everyone feels they belong and has the same opportunities to\nsucceed and do their best work. We believe that this includes open dialogue across all levels in the\nspirit of participation and involvement, the achievement of jointly set goals, and a responsible man-\nagement culture. It is particularly important to us that our employees form an emotional bond with\nour company, so we regularly review this using global employee surveys.\nFurther information on the results of these surveys can be found in the \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d section\nof the Combined Management Report.\nDiversity and inclusion\nWe are convinced that a diverse workforce enriches our teamwork enormously. This is because\ndifferent perspectives and experiences not only make us more innovative, they also boost our\ncompetitiveness, make us more creative, and help us to better understand and take into account the\nneeds of our consumers. Diversity and inclusion are thus not only actively promoted but form a core\ncomponent of our business strategy.\nThe global D&I roadmap formulated in 2021 and further refined in the reporting year supports us in\ncreating a culture rooted in diversity and inclusion. It encompasses a number of strategic priorities\nthat are presented in more detail in the \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d section of the Combined Management\nReport. This section also contains the relevant key figures, such as the percentage of women in man-\nagement positions and the number of management vacancies filled internally.\n111 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\ntesa\nTraining and education\nCompetition for employees with scientific and technical backgrounds is constantly on the rise within\nour industry. The advance of digitalization and internationalization is also changing work require-\nments and methods. We are meeting these challenges with comprehensive education and further\ntraining programs, as highly qualified, committed, and performance-oriented employees represent\na decisive competitive advantage for tesa. In addition, a wide range of training and development\nopportunities help to ensure that high potentials enjoy working for us long term.\nThe tesa Group offers its own training at its production facilities in Hamburg and Offenburg; we are\nalso planning to roll out such a training program for tesa SE\u2019s corporate headquarters beginning in\n2023. The focus here is on technical professions, for example chemicals technician, electronics tech-\nnician for industrial engineering, industrial mechanic, machine and plant operator, and mechatronics\ntechnician. In addition, we offer cooperative degree programs and vocational training programs in\nbusiness-related fields, such as plastics and elastomer technology, electrical engineering, and IT\nsystems integration.\nOur goal is to hire our trainees upon completion of their training for the long term. This is also\nreflected in our retention rates: In Hamburg, 79% of the trainees who completed their training in 2022\nwere retained, while in Offenburg the retention rate stood at 54%.\nIn order to identify and fully tap our employees\u2019 potential, we offer them a wide range of profes-\nsional and personal development opportunities. Our programs are designed with specific target\ngroups and areas of expertise in mind and include, for example, basic training for new employees. All\nemployees can take advantage of in-person and online training courses, for example on compliance,\noccupational safety, sales, as well as management and leadership. Since the start of the COVID-19\npandemic, we have expanded the number of online courses offered in order to provide employees\nwith a variety of options, even when they are working from home. In addition, courses from the digital\nlearning platform LinkedIn Learning complement our own programs.\nDiversity and equal opportunities\nDifferent perspectives help us to better understand the needs of our customers and at the same\ntime increase tesa\u2019s innovative spirit. That is why we are committed to greater diversity and equal\nopportunities.\nWhen filling new positions, we make a point of hiring employees with different cultural backgrounds.\nThe share of non-German nationals in the workforce increased by 3.1 percentage points to 8.7%\nbetween December 2020 and December 2022. We want to consolidate this trend and, for example,\nadvertise all vacancies for certain higher-level positions exclusively in English.\nIn the coming years, we are going to step up our efforts to promote gender equality within the work-\nforce and in leadership roles. We have set ourselves the target of having women account for 30% of\nthe first level below the Executive Board and 35% of the second level at tesa SE by mid-2027.\nAttractive working environment\nAn appealing environment can contribute to employee well-being. That\u2019s why our workplaces are\nequipped with ergonomic and contemporary furniture and equipment, such as height-adjustable\ndesks and modern lighting and ventilation concepts. In addition, we offer employees a health man-\nagement program at our corporate headquarters in Norderstedt. This program includes ergonomic\ncounseling, colorectal cancer screenings, a health club, and massages. Company medical care as\n112 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nwell as internal and external psychosocial counseling and support are also part of the health man-\nagement program.\nIn addition, our employees at our headquarters in Norderstedt can, among other offerings, take\nadvantage of a cleaning service, visit regular market stalls to purchase regional fruit and vegetables,\nand utilize various mobility concepts. For example, they have the ability to charge EVs and e-bikes at a\ncompany charging point and park rental bikes from Hamburg\u2019s \u201cStadtrad\u201d initiative at a station on site.\nEmployees also have the option of leasing bicycles through a subsidized program.\nOccupational health and safety\nBeiersdorf bears a great responsibility for workplace safety and the health of our employees. That\nis why we view the two as a comprehensive, holistic, and preventive management task. Our strategic\nobjective is therefore to reduce the number of accidents at work to zero and avoid work-related\nillnesses as well as undue physical and psychological stress factors. To achieve this goal, we conduct\nregular audits to determine how we can make our workplaces even safer and healthier.\nOur accident frequency rate (AFR) documents all accidents at work that result in at least one day\u2019s\nabsence from work. In the Consumer Business Segment, our AFR sank in 2022 to 0.5 accidents per\nmillion hours worked. This represents a 45% reduction in AFR compared to the previous year. We\nare particularly pleased to report that 73% of our production centers operated completely acci-\ndent-free throughout all of 2022. At tesa, the AFR of documented accidents resulting in at least one\nday of absence at ISO 14001 certified sites stood at 3.6 per million working hours worldwide in the\nreporting year (2021: 4.1).\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe risks to our employees still associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are integrated into our safety\nand health management activities. Our local teams continue to monitor the situation, comply with\nlocal legislation, and adapt protective measures whenever necessary.\nConsumer\nDriven by our Care Beyond Skin business purpose and guided by our core values, we are committed to\nreducing potential safety risks and incidents. Our Global Occupational Safety Department is respon-\nsible for managing safety at the workplace, but we also count on the cooperation of all employees at\nour sites.\nOur occupational health and safety strategy applies worldwide. It encompasses our most impor-\ntant current measures and programs and serves as a basis for our sites to develop their own local\nimplementation plans and measures. We monitor the progress of these measures using indicators\nat a global level.\nAs part of our continuous improvement efforts, we focus on reducing the main risks associated\nwith slips, trips, falls, forklift operation, and machine operation. Within the framework of our\nbehavior-based safety program, we encourage all employees to participate and provide feedback.\nWe focus on ensuring that our employees make each other aware of both misconduct and exem-\nplary safety implementation.\nManagement systems\nIn 2022, we further increased our global standards and focused on defining work methodologies\nfor technological innovations such as collaborative robots (COBOTs). In addition, we expanded our\nrequirements for key activities such as warehousing and forklift operations. This helps our managers\nintegrate safety and health protection into day-to-day operations.\n113 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nRespect for human rights\nBeiersdorf actively promotes compliance with laws, codes of conduct, and human rights. This\nresponsibility is deeply anchored in how we see ourselves, as well as in our core values. This not\nonly applies to our own sites and employees around the world, but also to all employees along\nthe value chain. We do not tolerate any form of corruption, forced labor, child labor, or discrimina-\ntion \u2013 neither at our own locations nor at any point in our supply chain. Furthermore, we support\nthe health and safety of employees in the workplace, employees\u2019 right to freedom of association,\nincluding collective bargaining, and environmental protection. We are also committed to equal\nrights and treatment as well as diversity.\nUpholding human rights throughout the value chain\nWe primarily see risks relating to compliance with human rights in purchasing and procurement, for\nexample of raw materials or services \u2013 and thus in our supply chains. Our goal is to eliminate or mini-\nmize all threats to human rights to the greatest extent possible.\nDue to our responsibility as a multinational company that operates across the globe and the legal\nrequirements with respect to human rights due diligence, we reevaluated the risk of human rights\nviolations involving our employees and our supply chain in the reporting year. This was conducted as\npart of our annual risk management process. If minimum social standards are not met, it may affect\nthe safety, health, and well-being of employees. As a result of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence\nAct coming into force, human rights violations can now result not only in considerable damage to our\nreputation, but also in substantial fines for companies. We are responding to this risk with, among\nother measures, a task force that is preparing the company\u2019s internal processes for the additional\nrequirements imposed by the law. In addition, we implement numerous preventive measures when it\ncomes to human rights to reduce negative impacts as far as possible.\nAs mentioned in our \u201cDeclaration of Principles on Respect for Human Rights,\u201d we are not only a\nsignatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) but also steer our own business activities\nand our collaboration with business partners based on fundamental principles and guidelines. These\ninclude the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO)\nConventions, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In addition, we fully comply\nwith all regulations and official requirements applicable in specific countries.\nWe focus on long-term relationships with business partners who commit to and align with our prin-\nciples of sustainable, responsible corporate governance and explicitly promote these. The internal\nand external codes of conduct for our employees and our suppliers contain binding requirements\non upholding human rights.\nWe require our business partners to meet our standards and communicate them to their upstream\nsupply chains. This applies both in terms of required product quality as well as transparent, fair,\nand responsible business practices. In this way, we want to ensure that our business partners live\nup to their social, environmental, and economic responsibilities \u2013 and ultimately manufacture\nhigh-quality products.\nConsumer\nConsumer Business Segment creates binding standards\nWith our Code of Conduct for Business Partners (CoC), the Consumer Business Segment has commit-\nted all our business partners along the supply chain with an annual purchasing volume of more than\n\u20ac 50,000 to comply fully with our standards. The CoC is aligned with our core values and establishes\nuniform, binding criteria for responsible business activities, including critical aspects such as prohibiting\n119 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\ncorruption, child labor, forced labor, and discrimination as well as promoting occupational health and\nsafety, the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and environmental protection.\nIn 2022, we procured more than 90% of our goods and services through partners who have explicitly\ncommitted to our CoC; we aim to increase this share in the future. We also revised the CoC in the\nreporting year to meet the requirements of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act which came\ninto force on January 1, 2023.\nRisk screenings and audits\nIn addition, environmental protection and occupational safety audits have been carried out at all\nBeiersdorf Consumer facilities since 2013. These audits are aligned with the requirements of the\nEnvironmental Protection and Safety Management Audit Scheme (ESMAS), which are based on the\ninternationally recognized ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) and ISO 45001 (occupa-\ntional health and safety management systems) standards.\nESMAS audits verify whether appropriate measures are implemented to guarantee compliance with\nour globally applicable environmental as well as occupational health and safety standards at our sites.\nDuring the reporting year, Beiersdorf\u2019s production sites in Hamburg and Berlin (Germany), Argentona\n(Spain), Sanand (India), Bangplee (Thailand), Malang (Indonesia), Shanghai (China), Itatiba (Brazil),\nMexico City (Mexico) and Lagos (Nigeria) were audited in accordance with the ESMAS standard.\nIn addition to the ESMAS audits, our facilities in Germany (Hamburg and Berlin), Spain (Argentona and\nTres Cantos), India, Indonesia, China, Brazil and Nigeria were audited in the reporting year in accord-\nance with the standardized 4-pillar audit protocol of the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA).\nAll of the audits performed are valid for three years and are therefore repeated every three years.\nThe Vice Presidents of the functions Sustainability and Procurement are responsible for sustainability\nin our overall sourcing operations and throughout the supply chain. A risk classification assessment\nis performed on all of our more than 21,000 direct suppliers; it examines whether more in-depth\nscreening and thus further measures beyond signing the CoC are required. Country-specific risks,\nthe quantity of goods purchased, and the proximity of the respective goods or service companies to\nBeiersdorf\u2019s brands are risks that all play a role in the risk classification process. Direct suppliers with a\nmedium risk rating must submit a comprehensive self-disclosure via the Sedex or EcoVadis platforms.\nOn this basis, we conduct a more detailed risk assessment, which the Responsible Sourcing team then\nuses to decide whether a subsequent audit is required. Direct supplier facilities with a high risk rating\nare required to undergo an on-site audit.\nTo ensure objectivity, the audits are carried out by independent certified auditors according to the\nstandardized SMETA 4-pillar audit protocol. The results of the audits highlight concrete challenges\nand fields for action and serve as a basis for the joint development of action plans with our suppliers.\nIn extreme cases, audit results may lead to the termination of business relationships. By leveraging\ninternational collaboration platforms such as Sedex, EcoVadis, and AIM-PROGRESS, we can con-\ntinuously improve our sustainability engagement right along the supply chain. In addition, we are\ncurrently restructuring the risk classification process. The goal is to integrate even more external\ninsights, indices, and data sources and make our processes even more robust from 2023 onward.\ntesa\nDesigning procurement processes in a responsible manner\nWe require direct suppliers to the tesa Business Segment to sign our Code of Conduct for Suppliers\n(CoCS). The CoCS forms the foundation for designing our global procurement processes in a\nresponsible manner and outlines fundamental rules and commitments in the areas of human rights,\nlabor standards, environmental protection and the prevention of corruption. It is based on the ten\n120 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nprinciples of the UN Global Compact, the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO),\nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We expect our suppliers to comply with our\nstandards and to remedy any shortcomings. In this context, we are implementing our own auditing\nprocess. In light of Germany\u2019s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, we also expanded the CoCS in\nthe reporting year and thus made the issue of human rights even more relevant. The new CoCS will\nbe valid from 2023.\nOur supply chains are global and complex, as we source raw materials, products, and services from\nall over the world. By working together closely, we aim to establish long-term, trusting partnerships\nwith regular suppliers. Our goal is to ensure that product quality, supply reliability, and our shared\ncommitment to sustainable growth remains on a high level.\nThe rules for our global procurement processes are defined and described in the Purchasing Com-\npliance Guideline (PCG), which also forms part of our Group-wide Compliance Manual. This policy\ncontains binding rules of conduct for tesa\u2019s procurement activities and is reviewed and revised on\nan ongoing basis.\nMore transparent supply chains\nWe not only require our major suppliers to comply with the tesa CoCS, our goal is also to gradually\nincrease transparency and sustainability across our entire supply chain.\nIn the reporting year, we introduced a systematic assessment process for our approximately\n10,000 suppliers. In this process, our Procurement and Sustainability Departments examine whether\na more in-depth risk analysis of the suppliers is necessary. This supplier screening process is carried\nout once a year and as required, for example in the case of new suppliers. In addition to risks specific\nto individual countries and industries, the quantity of goods purchased also plays a role in classi-\nfication, which extends across the risk categories very low, low, medium low, medium high, high,\nand very high. Factors such as strategic relevance are also included, for example if the company is a\nsupplier for an important raw material or a single-source supplier.\nWe have already been inviting direct suppliers to complete an assessment via the EcoVadis platform\nsince 2020. Suppliers with a good rating can thus demonstrate the extent to which they uphold\nhuman rights, maintain fair working conditions, and take environmental aspects into account, as well\nas responsibly produce and procure their products, raw materials, and services. In the future, these\ninvitations will be linked to risk factors in an even more targeted manner.\nAt the end of 2022, suppliers that are responsible for 54% (2021: 43%) of our direct purchasing volume\nhad submitted EcoVadis assessments. In the coming years, our aim is to gradually increase this figure,\nwith a goal of having sustainability assessments completed for a total of 80% of our direct purchasing\nvolume by 2025. Furthermore, our goal is that by 2030, 80% of our purchasing volume will be sourced\nexclusively from suppliers who meet our responsible supply chain standards - this means that, among\nother things, they have an EcoVadis assessment of at least 45 points.\nCompliance\nThe following Compliance section applies to both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments. Both\nBusiness Segments have established their own independent compliance management systems (CMS),\nwhich follow uniform standards and are implemented in close alignment between the two respective\nCorporate Compliance Management teams. Differences in the precise design of the CMS of the two\nBusiness Segments are described below, insofar as they exist.\n\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nOur Core Values for responsible conduct\nFor us, compliance means observing legal and commercial provisions and rules \u2013 and doing so\nwithout compromise. Both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments have established a respective\nCode of Conduct (CoC) to ensure compliance with these standards and to fulfill our social responsi-\nbility as a company in the best possible way. As an overarching value framework, the CoC is intended\nto guide everyone at the company when carrying our business activities. Furthermore, it supports all\nour employees, managers, and corporate bodies in complying with and living by the core principles\nand values of the Business Segments. As a directive for our actions, the CoC contributes to affirming\nour company\u2019s status now and in the future as a trusted partner to our customers, business partners,\nshareholders, and further stakeholders.\nGroup-wide compliance management\nOur Group-wide CMS is based on established standards such as the IDW AsS 980. We follow these\nguiding principles:\n\u2022 Prevent: Preventive measures are anchored in our management system to avoid wrongdoing.\n\u2022 Detect: We use risk analyses to detect and manage material compliance risks Group-wide. Addi-\ntional control instruments help reveal noncompliant behavior.\n\u2022 React and Improve: We penalize any violations of statutory or internal regulations as appropriate\nin each individual case. In addition, we continuously develop improvement measures for the\nentire CMS. We see our compliance management system as an important contribution to acting\nin a sustainable and forward-looking manner and thus living up to our tradition as a reliable and\ntrustworthy company.\nPrevent\nAntitrust law continues to be an important compliance issue for both parts of the Group. The\nreasons for this are our business models, legal complexity, the continually increasing prosecution\nactivity worldwide, as well as the potential for sanctions by antitrust authorities. In addition to\nantitrust law, preventing corruption and acting in accordance with privacy laws are two other focal\npoints of our compliance programs. These programs serve to specifically raise the awareness of our\nrelevant employee groups to these topics and to provide them with both the confidence to act and\nmake decisions.\nOur Corporate Compliance departments are responsible for defining, developing, and monitoring the\nminimum standards for these programs, as well as an appropriate CMS in their respective organization.\nIn our regions and at our affiliates, we have established local compliance officers who are responsible for\ncommunicating all elements of the compliance programs to our employees and working to ensure that\nthey are applied locally. The aim is to enshrine all elements of our compliance system in the regions and\naffiliates and to monitor and improve them on an ongoing basis. A special network of external attorneys\nspecialized in antitrust issues is available to local companies. Practice-oriented training and consulting\nservices as well as various guidelines form the core elements of our compliance programs:\n\u2022 The antitrust guidelines provide clear directives on antitrust-compliant behavior, requirements\nfor contact and the exchange of information with competitors, guidance for communication with\ncustomers, for example, with regard to sale prices, as well as fundamental dos and don\u2019ts.\n\u2022 The anti-corruption guidelines serve as a guide to dealing with gifts, product samples, and invita-\ntions from and to representatives and employees of other companies or public officials. They also\ncontain information on how to deal with conflicts of interest.\n122 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\n\u2022 The data protection guidelines describe, in particular, how the principles of the European Union\u2019s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are implemented for the lawful processing of data at\nour EU companies. These guidelines direct and instruct our employees on how to handle data in a\nlegally compliant manner. In addition, the data protection teams have established internal partner-\nships with key data protection functions such as Cyber Security and Procurement.\nWe have implemented a comprehensive, target group-specific training concept. Taking a risk-oriented\napproach, we train an average of several thousand employees worldwide annually on corruption\nprevention as well as antitrust and data protection-compliant behavior. This training is delivered\nface-to-face or in an e-learning format and it serves to raise our employees\u2019 awareness of the topic\nand to show them where to obtain further support. In addition, Members of the Executive Board and\nSupervisory Board are regularly informed about relevant compliance matters. In the fiscal year 2022,\nthe Consumer Business Segment achieved a total training participation rate of 97% and tesa of 99%.\nThe total participation rate applies to the target and risk group defined in advance for the respective\ncompliance fields of antitrust law, anti-corruption, and data protection. This includes all employees\nand managers who may come into contact with the respective issues and requirements.\nOur employees can find key guidance and information on the relevant compliance intranet pages.\nIn addition, we use various communication channels such as the intranet and email to inform our\nworkforce regularly about compliance topics and related new developments. Furthermore, we\nregularly exchange information with our local affiliates on generally relevant updates, emerging\nquestions, or best-practice approaches, for example.\nThese ongoing communication and training measures help us institutionalize the compliance principles\nat our companies.\nDetect\nThe analysis of compliance risks forms the basis of our compliance management system and our\ncompliance programs. To this end, we regularly identify existing and future compliance risk areas in\nour business models and our geographical presence as part of a holistic compliance risk assessment.\nIn addition, both Corporate Compliance departments support their management teams in identifying\nrisks that go beyond their own organizational responsibility.\nIn a second step, these are then evaluated and prioritized. High-priority issues are analyzed for their\nspecific risks in order to ensure that appropriate countermeasures exist or are taken. This is carried\nout both centrally and at the affiliates. The results are presented to the Executive Board and leveraged\nto continually adapt and improve our global and local compliance programs.\nIn order to operate in a fully compliant manner over the long term and maintain and further promote\nan open and trusting compliance and communication culture, it is essential that individual employees\nare personally committed to the issue. This also includes reporting possible compliance violations\nand other complaints \u2013 even anonymously, if they so desire. To this end, we have established and\ncommunicated various reporting systems.\nFor example, the Consumer Business Segment launched the \u201cSpeak up. We care.\u201d whistleblowing\nplatform that can be accessed from anywhere in the world around the clock. The tesa Business Segment\nhas also been using this platform since this reporting period. Furthermore, external ombudspersons\nreceived confidential information on potential compliance violations on behalf of tesa until 31.10.2022.\nThe whistleblowing platforms are available not only to our own employees but also to customers,\nconsumers, suppliers, and other external stakeholders for the purpose of reporting possible\nmisconduct. Besides the above, we also provide internal options for reporting such as Corporate\nCompliance email addresses.\n123 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nWe have established processes to investigate and clarify any information received and ensure that\nappropriate measures are taken, following careful consideration. Relevant specialist functions and the\nCorporate Auditing Department are usually involved in the investigation.\nCorporate Auditing is another independent monitoring function within Beiersdorf AG. This depart-\nment conducts regular audits of both Business Segments, of which compliance-relevant topics form\nan integral part. In addition, each Corporate Compliance Department regularly monitors compliance\nwith centrally defined minimum standards, through on-site visits or queries about the implementation\nof measures, for instance.\nReact and improve\nWe closely monitor the effectiveness of our compliance management system by means of our regular\nGroup-wide compliance reporting. The results are reported to the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard. These reports document compliance incidents as well as the status of our compliance programs\ncentrally and at affiliates worldwide. We derive further courses of action based on this information\nand implement appropriate measures. The affiliates are naturally required to inform the Corporate\nCompliance Department immediately about any material compliance incidents, including outside the\nregular reporting cycles, in order to be able to respond immediately.\nWe consider the continual and thorough development of our compliance management systems as an\nintegral part of our activities. This is how we take internal adaptation requirements into account, as\nwell as the dynamic changes in legal frameworks and economic conditions. In the reporting year, we\ndeveloped formalized audit formats for this purpose in the Consumer Business Segment and carried\nthem out at select affiliates. On the basis of the formats, we analyze the effectiveness of antitrust and\ndata protection compliance and improve it on an ongoing basis. At tesa, we revised the data privacy\nguidelines, the whistleblowing guidelines, and the case management process. We also reviewed the\nstatus of local compliance implementation at certain affiliates.\nOther Issues\nProduct Safety\nOur highest priority is to provide safe products that are fully compatible with our consumers\u2019 health\nand the environment. All our products therefore need to comply with numerous statutory require-\nments before they can receive official market approval. Both Business Segments apply high standards\nin this regard.\nConsumer\nIn this respect, our understanding of quality goes beyond the evaluation and approval of our\nproducts. We understand quality as a dynamic process that contributes to continuous improvement\nand express this understanding in the Beiersdorf Quality Policy. It guides our Executive Board, our\nmanagement, and all our employees in their daily activities.\nIt also serves to maintain and build on our consumers\u2019 satisfaction and high level of trust, and to\nensure that we remain competitive in the future.\nSafety evaluation of all raw materials and cosmetic product formulas\nTo ensure that we meet our own strict requirements regarding the quality of our products, we employ\na team of experienced, highly qualified safety assessors. First, this team must perform the legally\nrequired evaluation and approval of the raw materials, formulas, packaging materials, and product\nclaims, thereby verifying their safety and compatibility for consumers. Only then do the safety asses-\nsors approve the finished products for distribution. This is done primarily in accordance with the\n124"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

These include aspects\nregarding the environment, employees, society, human rights, and anti-corruption. The following\nsections of the Annual Report constitute the Combined Non-financial Statement (NFS) for the\nBeiersdorf Group (Consumer and tesa Business Segments) and Beiersdorf AG, as defined under\nsections 315b and 289b of the Handelsgesetzbuch (German Commercial Code, HGB).\nFurthermore, both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments publish separate sustainability reports\nwhich provide further information on their respective sustainability activities and projects.\nApplication of international reporting frameworks\nDue to the different materiality requirements set out in the GRI Standards, United Nations Global\nCompact (UNGC), and Germany\u2019s CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), neither the\nBeiersdorf Group nor Beiersdorf AG applied any international frameworks in accordance with section\n315c(3) of the HGB in conjunction with section 289d of the HGB to prepare the Non-financial Statement.\nThe Consumer Business Segment, however, follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards in\nits broader sustainability reporting and publishes a separate GRI index.\nBoth business segments are United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) members and report on their\nachievements and measures taken in the reporting period in order to implement the ten princi-\nples of the UNGC in the areas of human rights, working conditions, environmental protection, and\nanti-corruption. This Non-financial Statement systematically and comprehensively fulfills the UNGC\nCommunication on Progress (CoP) requirements for the Beiersdorf Group.\nMaterial non-financial topics for the business segments\nBoth business segments conduct materiality analyses to strategically identify and review sustainability\ntopics. In the Consumer Business Segment, such an analysis was last carried out in 2021. The f ollowing\nmaterial topics were identified during this process: Climate protection, circular economy, sustaina-\nble land use and biodiversity, sustainable use of water, diversity and inclusion, education and training,\nemployer attractiveness, occupational health and safety, safeguarding human rights, community\nengagement, compliance and business ethics, and product safety.\nThe tesa Business Segment last updated its materiality matrix with members of relevant specialist\ndepartments in 2020. The material non-financial topics identified are climate and energy, product\nsustainability, resource efficiency, water, employee development, diversity and equal opportuni-\nties, occupational health and safety, human rights, prevention of anticompetitive behavior, and\nproduct safety. For an overview of all material non-financial topics relating to the Consumer and\ntesa Business Segments, together with section and page references, please refer to our index to\nthe Non-financial Statement.\nStatement scope\nDisclosures on the material NFS topics are mainly provided separately for the tesa and Consumer\nBusiness Segments. In principle, all information is reported jointly for the Beiersdorf Group and\nBeiersdorf AG. Key figures that are collected separately for Beiersdorf AG are listed in the table\n\u201cRelevant Key Figures for the Non-financial Statement of the Beiersdorf AG\u201d.\n88 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\npose a threat to water are emptied, refilled, and stored only in areas that are equipped with appropriate\nretention tanks. We use equipment to measure turbidity and solvent concentration to ensure that con-\ntaminated surface water is not discharged into the sewer system. We have emergency plans in place\nto determine the exact course of action in the event of a leakage of substances hazardous to water. All\nthese measures are regularly reviewed in our external ISO 14001 audits and are a precondition for a\nsuccessful audit result.\nEmployees\nOur employees play a key role in the sustainable development of our company. Their expertise,\nskills, and commitment ensure that we remain competitive and innovative. Our goal is to create an\nattractive, inclusive workplace that recognizes the individual performance and actively promotes the\npotential of a diverse workforce.\nConsumer\nTraining and education\nThe changes in our working world require an agile and dynamic approach to work and thus a high\ndegree of flexibility and willingness to learn. This makes it all the more important to foster our\nemployees\u2019 personal strengths and invest in their long-term development. To this end, we offer\ncomprehensive training and development opportunities that also support lifelong learning.\nMore information on the key topic of training and development, as well as knowledge and learning,\ncan be found in the Combined Management Report in the section entitled \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d.\nEmployer attractiveness\nWe want to be an attractive employer for our employees and offer them a safe, attractive, and\ninclusive working environment where everyone feels they belong and has the same opportunities to\nsucceed and do their best work. We believe that this includes open dialogue across all levels in the\nspirit of participation and involvement, the achievement of jointly set goals, and a responsible man-\nagement culture. It is particularly important to us that our employees form an emotional bond with\nour company, so we regularly review this using global employee surveys.\nFurther information on the results of these surveys can be found in the \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d section\nof the Combined Management Report.\nDiversity and inclusion\nWe are convinced that a diverse workforce enriches our teamwork enormously. This is because\ndifferent perspectives and experiences not only make us more innovative, they also boost our\ncompetitiveness, make us more creative, and help us to better understand and take into account the\nneeds of our consumers. Diversity and inclusion are thus not only actively promoted but form a core\ncomponent of our business strategy.\nThe global D&I roadmap formulated in 2021 and further refined in the reporting year supports us in\ncreating a culture rooted in diversity and inclusion. It encompasses a number of strategic priorities\nthat are presented in more detail in the \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d section of the Combined Management\nReport. This section also contains the relevant key figures, such as the percentage of women in man-\nagement positions and the number of management vacancies filled internally.\n111 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\ntesa\nTraining and education\nCompetition for employees with scientific and technical backgrounds is constantly on the rise within\nour industry. The advance of digitalization and internationalization is also changing work require-\nments and methods. We are meeting these challenges with comprehensive education and further\ntraining programs, as highly qualified, committed, and performance-oriented employees represent\na decisive competitive advantage for tesa. In addition, a wide range of training and development\nopportunities help to ensure that high potentials enjoy working for us long term.\nThe tesa Group offers its own training at its production facilities in Hamburg and Offenburg; we are\nalso planning to roll out such a training program for tesa SE\u2019s corporate headquarters beginning in\n2023. The focus here is on technical professions, for example chemicals technician, electronics tech-\nnician for industrial engineering, industrial mechanic, machine and plant operator, and mechatronics\ntechnician. In addition, we offer cooperative degree programs and vocational training programs in\nbusiness-related fields, such as plastics and elastomer technology, electrical engineering, and IT\nsystems integration.\nOur goal is to hire our trainees upon completion of their training for the long term. This is also\nreflected in our retention rates: In Hamburg, 79% of the trainees who completed their training in 2022\nwere retained, while in Offenburg the retention rate stood at 54%.\nIn order to identify and fully tap our employees\u2019 potential, we offer them a wide range of profes-\nsional and personal development opportunities. Our programs are designed with specific target\ngroups and areas of expertise in mind and include, for example, basic training for new employees. All\nemployees can take advantage of in-person and online training courses, for example on compliance,\noccupational safety, sales, as well as management and leadership. Since the start of the COVID-19\npandemic, we have expanded the number of online courses offered in order to provide employees\nwith a variety of options, even when they are working from home. In addition, courses from the digital\nlearning platform LinkedIn Learning complement our own programs.\nDiversity and equal opportunities\nDifferent perspectives help us to better understand the needs of our customers and at the same\ntime increase tesa\u2019s innovative spirit. That is why we are committed to greater diversity and equal\nopportunities.\nWhen filling new positions, we make a point of hiring employees with different cultural backgrounds.\nThe share of non-German nationals in the workforce increased by 3.1 percentage points to 8.7%\nbetween December 2020 and December 2022. We want to consolidate this trend and, for example,\nadvertise all vacancies for certain higher-level positions exclusively in English.\nIn the coming years, we are going to step up our efforts to promote gender equality within the work-\nforce and in leadership roles. We have set ourselves the target of having women account for 30% of\nthe first level below the Executive Board and 35% of the second level at tesa SE by mid-2027.\nAttractive working environment\nAn appealing environment can contribute to employee well-being. That\u2019s why our workplaces are\nequipped with ergonomic and contemporary furniture and equipment, such as height-adjustable\ndesks and modern lighting and ventilation concepts. In addition, we offer employees a health man-\nagement program at our corporate headquarters in Norderstedt. This program includes ergonomic\ncounseling, colorectal cancer screenings, a health club, and massages. Company medical care as\n112 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nwell as internal and external psychosocial counseling and support are also part of the health man-\nagement program.\nIn addition, our employees at our headquarters in Norderstedt can, among other offerings, take\nadvantage of a cleaning service, visit regular market stalls to purchase regional fruit and vegetables,\nand utilize various mobility concepts. For example, they have the ability to charge EVs and e-bikes at a\ncompany charging point and park rental bikes from Hamburg\u2019s \u201cStadtrad\u201d initiative at a station on site.\nEmployees also have the option of leasing bicycles through a subsidized program.\nOccupational health and safety\nBeiersdorf bears a great responsibility for workplace safety and the health of our employees. That\nis why we view the two as a comprehensive, holistic, and preventive management task. Our strategic\nobjective is therefore to reduce the number of accidents at work to zero and avoid work-related\nillnesses as well as undue physical and psychological stress factors. To achieve this goal, we conduct\nregular audits to determine how we can make our workplaces even safer and healthier.\nOur accident frequency rate (AFR) documents all accidents at work that result in at least one day\u2019s\nabsence from work. In the Consumer Business Segment, our AFR sank in 2022 to 0.5 accidents per\nmillion hours worked. This represents a 45% reduction in AFR compared to the previous year. We\nare particularly pleased to report that 73% of our production centers operated completely acci-\ndent-free throughout all of 2022. At tesa, the AFR of documented accidents resulting in at least one\nday of absence at ISO 14001 certified sites stood at 3.6 per million working hours worldwide in the\nreporting year (2021: 4.1).\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe risks to our employees still associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are integrated into our safety\nand health management activities. Our local teams continue to monitor the situation, comply with\nlocal legislation, and adapt protective measures whenever necessary.\nConsumer\nDriven by our Care Beyond Skin business purpose and guided by our core values, we are committed to\nreducing potential safety risks and incidents. Our Global Occupational Safety Department is respon-\nsible for managing safety at the workplace, but we also count on the cooperation of all employees at\nour sites.\nOur occupational health and safety strategy applies worldwide. It encompasses our most impor-\ntant current measures and programs and serves as a basis for our sites to develop their own local\nimplementation plans and measures. We monitor the progress of these measures using indicators\nat a global level.\nAs part of our continuous improvement efforts, we focus on reducing the main risks associated\nwith slips, trips, falls, forklift operation, and machine operation. Within the framework of our\nbehavior-based safety program, we encourage all employees to participate and provide feedback.\nWe focus on ensuring that our employees make each other aware of both misconduct and exem-\nplary safety implementation.\nManagement systems\nIn 2022, we further increased our global standards and focused on defining work methodologies\nfor technological innovations such as collaborative robots (COBOTs). In addition, we expanded our\nrequirements for key activities such as warehousing and forklift operations. This helps our managers\nintegrate safety and health protection into day-to-day operations.\n113 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nRespect for human rights\nBeiersdorf actively promotes compliance with laws, codes of conduct, and human rights. This\nresponsibility is deeply anchored in how we see ourselves, as well as in our core values. This not\nonly applies to our own sites and employees around the world, but also to all employees along\nthe value chain. We do not tolerate any form of corruption, forced labor, child labor, or discrimina-\ntion \u2013 neither at our own locations nor at any point in our supply chain. Furthermore, we support\nthe health and safety of employees in the workplace, employees\u2019 right to freedom of association,\nincluding collective bargaining, and environmental protection. We are also committed to equal\nrights and treatment as well as diversity.\nUpholding human rights throughout the value chain\nWe primarily see risks relating to compliance with human rights in purchasing and procurement, for\nexample of raw materials or services \u2013 and thus in our supply chains. Our goal is to eliminate or mini-\nmize all threats to human rights to the greatest extent possible.\nDue to our responsibility as a multinational company that operates across the globe and the legal\nrequirements with respect to human rights due diligence, we reevaluated the risk of human rights\nviolations involving our employees and our supply chain in the reporting year. This was conducted as\npart of our annual risk management process. If minimum social standards are not met, it may affect\nthe safety, health, and well-being of employees. As a result of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence\nAct coming into force, human rights violations can now result not only in considerable damage to our\nreputation, but also in substantial fines for companies. We are responding to this risk with, among\nother measures, a task force that is preparing the company\u2019s internal processes for the additional\nrequirements imposed by the law. In addition, we implement numerous preventive measures when it\ncomes to human rights to reduce negative impacts as far as possible.\nAs mentioned in our \u201cDeclaration of Principles on Respect for Human Rights,\u201d we are not only a\nsignatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) but also steer our own business activities\nand our collaboration with business partners based on fundamental principles and guidelines. These\ninclude the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO)\nConventions, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In addition, we fully comply\nwith all regulations and official requirements applicable in specific countries.\nWe focus on long-term relationships with business partners who commit to and align with our prin-\nciples of sustainable, responsible corporate governance and explicitly promote these. The internal\nand external codes of conduct for our employees and our suppliers contain binding requirements\non upholding human rights.\nWe require our business partners to meet our standards and communicate them to their upstream\nsupply chains. This applies both in terms of required product quality as well as transparent, fair,\nand responsible business practices. In this way, we want to ensure that our business partners live\nup to their social, environmental, and economic responsibilities \u2013 and ultimately manufacture\nhigh-quality products.\nConsumer\nConsumer Business Segment creates binding standards\nWith our Code of Conduct for Business Partners (CoC), the Consumer Business Segment has commit-\nted all our business partners along the supply chain with an annual purchasing volume of more than\n\u20ac 50,000 to comply fully with our standards. The CoC is aligned with our core values and establishes\nuniform, binding criteria for responsible business activities, including critical aspects such as prohibiting\n119 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\ncorruption, child labor, forced labor, and discrimination as well as promoting occupational health and\nsafety, the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and environmental protection.\nIn 2022, we procured more than 90% of our goods and services through partners who have explicitly\ncommitted to our CoC; we aim to increase this share in the future. We also revised the CoC in the\nreporting year to meet the requirements of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act which came\ninto force on January 1, 2023.\nRisk screenings and audits\nIn addition, environmental protection and occupational safety audits have been carried out at all\nBeiersdorf Consumer facilities since 2013. These audits are aligned with the requirements of the\nEnvironmental Protection and Safety Management Audit Scheme (ESMAS), which are based on the\ninternationally recognized ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) and ISO 45001 (occupa-\ntional health and safety management systems) standards.\nESMAS audits verify whether appropriate measures are implemented to guarantee compliance with\nour globally applicable environmental as well as occupational health and safety standards at our sites.\nDuring the reporting year, Beiersdorf\u2019s production sites in Hamburg and Berlin (Germany), Argentona\n(Spain), Sanand (India), Bangplee (Thailand), Malang (Indonesia), Shanghai (China), Itatiba (Brazil),\nMexico City (Mexico) and Lagos (Nigeria) were audited in accordance with the ESMAS standard.\nIn addition to the ESMAS audits, our facilities in Germany (Hamburg and Berlin), Spain (Argentona and\nTres Cantos), India, Indonesia, China, Brazil and Nigeria were audited in the reporting year in accord-\nance with the standardized 4-pillar audit protocol of the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA).\nAll of the audits performed are valid for three years and are therefore repeated every three years.\nThe Vice Presidents of the functions Sustainability and Procurement are responsible for sustainability\nin our overall sourcing operations and throughout the supply chain. A risk classification assessment\nis performed on all of our more than 21,000 direct suppliers; it examines whether more in-depth\nscreening and thus further measures beyond signing the CoC are required. Country-specific risks,\nthe quantity of goods purchased, and the proximity of the respective goods or service companies to\nBeiersdorf\u2019s brands are risks that all play a role in the risk classification process. Direct suppliers with a\nmedium risk rating must submit a comprehensive self-disclosure via the Sedex or EcoVadis platforms.\nOn this basis, we conduct a more detailed risk assessment, which the Responsible Sourcing team then\nuses to decide whether a subsequent audit is required. Direct supplier facilities with a high risk rating\nare required to undergo an on-site audit.\nTo ensure objectivity, the audits are carried out by independent certified auditors according to the\nstandardized SMETA 4-pillar audit protocol. The results of the audits highlight concrete challenges\nand fields for action and serve as a basis for the joint development of action plans with our suppliers.\nIn extreme cases, audit results may lead to the termination of business relationships. By leveraging\ninternational collaboration platforms such as Sedex, EcoVadis, and AIM-PROGRESS, we can con-\ntinuously improve our sustainability engagement right along the supply chain. In addition, we are\ncurrently restructuring the risk classification process. The goal is to integrate even more external\ninsights, indices, and data sources and make our processes even more robust from 2023 onward.\ntesa\nDesigning procurement processes in a responsible manner\nWe require direct suppliers to the tesa Business Segment to sign our Code of Conduct for Suppliers\n(CoCS). The CoCS forms the foundation for designing our global procurement processes in a\nresponsible manner and outlines fundamental rules and commitments in the areas of human rights,\nlabor standards, environmental protection and the prevention of corruption. It is based on the ten\n120 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nprinciples of the UN Global Compact, the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO),\nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We expect our suppliers to comply with our\nstandards and to remedy any shortcomings. In this context, we are implementing our own auditing\nprocess. In light of Germany\u2019s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, we also expanded the CoCS in\nthe reporting year and thus made the issue of human rights even more relevant. The new CoCS will\nbe valid from 2023.\nOur supply chains are global and complex, as we source raw materials, products, and services from\nall over the world. By working together closely, we aim to establish long-term, trusting partnerships\nwith regular suppliers. Our goal is to ensure that product quality, supply reliability, and our shared\ncommitment to sustainable growth remains on a high level.\nThe rules for our global procurement processes are defined and described in the Purchasing Com-\npliance Guideline (PCG), which also forms part of our Group-wide Compliance Manual. This policy\ncontains binding rules of conduct for tesa\u2019s procurement activities and is reviewed and revised on\nan ongoing basis.\nMore transparent supply chains\nWe not only require our major suppliers to comply with the tesa CoCS, our goal is also to gradually\nincrease transparency and sustainability across our entire supply chain.\nIn the reporting year, we introduced a systematic assessment process for our approximately\n10,000 suppliers. In this process, our Procurement and Sustainability Departments examine whether\na more in-depth risk analysis of the suppliers is necessary. This supplier screening process is carried\nout once a year and as required, for example in the case of new suppliers. In addition to risks specific\nto individual countries and industries, the quantity of goods purchased also plays a role in classi-\nfication, which extends across the risk categories very low, low, medium low, medium high, high,\nand very high. Factors such as strategic relevance are also included, for example if the company is a\nsupplier for an important raw material or a single-source supplier.\nWe have already been inviting direct suppliers to complete an assessment via the EcoVadis platform\nsince 2020. Suppliers with a good rating can thus demonstrate the extent to which they uphold\nhuman rights, maintain fair working conditions, and take environmental aspects into account, as well\nas responsibly produce and procure their products, raw materials, and services. In the future, these\ninvitations will be linked to risk factors in an even more targeted manner.\nAt the end of 2022, suppliers that are responsible for 54% (2021: 43%) of our direct purchasing volume\nhad submitted EcoVadis assessments. In the coming years, our aim is to gradually increase this figure,\nwith a goal of having sustainability assessments completed for a total of 80% of our direct purchasing\nvolume by 2025. Furthermore, our goal is that by 2030, 80% of our purchasing volume will be sourced\nexclusively from suppliers who meet our responsible supply chain standards - this means that, among\nother things, they have an EcoVadis assessment of at least 45 points.\nCompliance\nThe following Compliance section applies to both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments. Both\nBusiness Segments have established their own independent compliance management systems (CMS),\nwhich follow uniform standards and are implemented in close alignment between the two respective\nCorporate Compliance Management teams. Differences in the precise design of the CMS of the two\nBusiness Segments are described below, insofar as they exist.\n\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nOur Core Values for responsible conduct\nFor us, compliance means observing legal and commercial provisions and rules \u2013 and doing so\nwithout compromise. Both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments have established a respective\nCode of Conduct (CoC) to ensure compliance with these standards and to fulfill our social responsi-\nbility as a company in the best possible way. As an overarching value framework, the CoC is intended\nto guide everyone at the company when carrying our business activities. Furthermore, it supports all\nour employees, managers, and corporate bodies in complying with and living by the core principles\nand values of the Business Segments. As a directive for our actions, the CoC contributes to affirming\nour company\u2019s status now and in the future as a trusted partner to our customers, business partners,\nshareholders, and further stakeholders.\nGroup-wide compliance management\nOur Group-wide CMS is based on established standards such as the IDW AsS 980. We follow these\nguiding principles:\n\u2022 Prevent: Preventive measures are anchored in our management system to avoid wrongdoing.\n\u2022 Detect: We use risk analyses to detect and manage material compliance risks Group-wide. Addi-\ntional control instruments help reveal noncompliant behavior.\n\u2022 React and Improve: We penalize any violations of statutory or internal regulations as appropriate\nin each individual case. In addition, we continuously develop improvement measures for the\nentire CMS. We see our compliance management system as an important contribution to acting\nin a sustainable and forward-looking manner and thus living up to our tradition as a reliable and\ntrustworthy company.\nPrevent\nAntitrust law continues to be an important compliance issue for both parts of the Group. The\nreasons for this are our business models, legal complexity, the continually increasing prosecution\nactivity worldwide, as well as the potential for sanctions by antitrust authorities. In addition to\nantitrust law, preventing corruption and acting in accordance with privacy laws are two other focal\npoints of our compliance programs. These programs serve to specifically raise the awareness of our\nrelevant employee groups to these topics and to provide them with both the confidence to act and\nmake decisions.\nOur Corporate Compliance departments are responsible for defining, developing, and monitoring the\nminimum standards for these programs, as well as an appropriate CMS in their respective organization.\nIn our regions and at our affiliates, we have established local compliance officers who are responsible for\ncommunicating all elements of the compliance programs to our employees and working to ensure that\nthey are applied locally. The aim is to enshrine all elements of our compliance system in the regions and\naffiliates and to monitor and improve them on an ongoing basis. A special network of external attorneys\nspecialized in antitrust issues is available to local companies. Practice-oriented training and consulting\nservices as well as various guidelines form the core elements of our compliance programs:\n\u2022 The antitrust guidelines provide clear directives on antitrust-compliant behavior, requirements\nfor contact and the exchange of information with competitors, guidance for communication with\ncustomers, for example, with regard to sale prices, as well as fundamental dos and don\u2019ts.\n\u2022 The anti-corruption guidelines serve as a guide to dealing with gifts, product samples, and invita-\ntions from and to representatives and employees of other companies or public officials. They also\ncontain information on how to deal with conflicts of interest.\n122 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\n\u2022 The data protection guidelines describe, in particular, how the principles of the European Union\u2019s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are implemented for the lawful processing of data at\nour EU companies. These guidelines direct and instruct our employees on how to handle data in a\nlegally compliant manner. In addition, the data protection teams have established internal partner-\nships with key data protection functions such as Cyber Security and Procurement.\nWe have implemented a comprehensive, target group-specific training concept. Taking a risk-oriented\napproach, we train an average of several thousand employees worldwide annually on corruption\nprevention as well as antitrust and data protection-compliant behavior. This training is delivered\nface-to-face or in an e-learning format and it serves to raise our employees\u2019 awareness of the topic\nand to show them where to obtain further support. In addition, Members of the Executive Board and\nSupervisory Board are regularly informed about relevant compliance matters. In the fiscal year 2022,\nthe Consumer Business Segment achieved a total training participation rate of 97% and tesa of 99%.\nThe total participation rate applies to the target and risk group defined in advance for the respective\ncompliance fields of antitrust law, anti-corruption, and data protection. This includes all employees\nand managers who may come into contact with the respective issues and requirements.\nOur employees can find key guidance and information on the relevant compliance intranet pages.\nIn addition, we use various communication channels such as the intranet and email to inform our\nworkforce regularly about compliance topics and related new developments. Furthermore, we\nregularly exchange information with our local affiliates on generally relevant updates, emerging\nquestions, or best-practice approaches, for example.\nThese ongoing communication and training measures help us institutionalize the compliance principles\nat our companies.\nDetect\nThe analysis of compliance risks forms the basis of our compliance management system and our\ncompliance programs. To this end, we regularly identify existing and future compliance risk areas in\nour business models and our geographical presence as part of a holistic compliance risk assessment.\nIn addition, both Corporate Compliance departments support their management teams in identifying\nrisks that go beyond their own organizational responsibility.\nIn a second step, these are then evaluated and prioritized. High-priority issues are analyzed for their\nspecific risks in order to ensure that appropriate countermeasures exist or are taken. This is carried\nout both centrally and at the affiliates. The results are presented to the Executive Board and leveraged\nto continually adapt and improve our global and local compliance programs.\nIn order to operate in a fully compliant manner over the long term and maintain and further promote\nan open and trusting compliance and communication culture, it is essential that individual employees\nare personally committed to the issue. This also includes reporting possible compliance violations\nand other complaints \u2013 even anonymously, if they so desire. To this end, we have established and\ncommunicated various reporting systems.\nFor example, the Consumer Business Segment launched the \u201cSpeak up. We care.\u201d whistleblowing\nplatform that can be accessed from anywhere in the world around the clock. The tesa Business Segment\nhas also been using this platform since this reporting period. Furthermore, external ombudspersons\nreceived confidential information on potential compliance violations on behalf of tesa until 31.10.2022.\nThe whistleblowing platforms are available not only to our own employees but also to customers,\nconsumers, suppliers, and other external stakeholders for the purpose of reporting possible\nmisconduct. Besides the above, we also provide internal options for reporting such as Corporate\nCompliance email addresses.\n123 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nWe have established processes to investigate and clarify any information received and ensure that\nappropriate measures are taken, following careful consideration. Relevant specialist functions and the\nCorporate Auditing Department are usually involved in the investigation.\nCorporate Auditing is another independent monitoring function within Beiersdorf AG. This depart-\nment conducts regular audits of both Business Segments, of which compliance-relevant topics form\nan integral part. In addition, each Corporate Compliance Department regularly monitors compliance\nwith centrally defined minimum standards, through on-site visits or queries about the implementation\nof measures, for instance.\nReact and improve\nWe closely monitor the effectiveness of our compliance management system by means of our regular\nGroup-wide compliance reporting. The results are reported to the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard. These reports document compliance incidents as well as the status of our compliance programs\ncentrally and at affiliates worldwide. We derive further courses of action based on this information\nand implement appropriate measures. The affiliates are naturally required to inform the Corporate\nCompliance Department immediately about any material compliance incidents, including outside the\nregular reporting cycles, in order to be able to respond immediately.\nWe consider the continual and thorough development of our compliance management systems as an\nintegral part of our activities. This is how we take internal adaptation requirements into account, as\nwell as the dynamic changes in legal frameworks and economic conditions. In the reporting year, we\ndeveloped formalized audit formats for this purpose in the Consumer Business Segment and carried\nthem out at select affiliates. On the basis of the formats, we analyze the effectiveness of antitrust and\ndata protection compliance and improve it on an ongoing basis. At tesa, we revised the data privacy\nguidelines, the whistleblowing guidelines, and the case management process. We also reviewed the\nstatus of local compliance implementation at certain affiliates.\nOther Issues\nProduct Safety\nOur highest priority is to provide safe products that are fully compatible with our consumers\u2019 health\nand the environment. All our products therefore need to comply with numerous statutory require-\nments before they can receive official market approval. Both Business Segments apply high standards\nin this regard.\nConsumer\nIn this respect, our understanding of quality goes beyond the evaluation and approval of our\nproducts. We understand quality as a dynamic process that contributes to continuous improvement\nand express this understanding in the Beiersdorf Quality Policy. It guides our Executive Board, our\nmanagement, and all our employees in their daily activities.\nIt also serves to maintain and build on our consumers\u2019 satisfaction and high level of trust, and to\nensure that we remain competitive in the future.\nSafety evaluation of all raw materials and cosmetic product formulas\nTo ensure that we meet our own strict requirements regarding the quality of our products, we employ\na team of experienced, highly qualified safety assessors. First, this team must perform the legally\nrequired evaluation and approval of the raw materials, formulas, packaging materials, and product\nclaims, thereby verifying their safety and compatibility for consumers. Only then do the safety asses-\nsors approve the finished products for distribution. This is done primarily in accordance with the\n124"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short,precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

These include aspects\nregarding the environment, employees, society, human rights, and anti-corruption. The following\nsections of the Annual Report constitute the Combined Non-financial Statement (NFS) for the\nBeiersdorf Group (Consumer and tesa Business Segments) and Beiersdorf AG, as defined under\nsections 315b and 289b of the Handelsgesetzbuch (German Commercial Code, HGB).\nFurthermore, both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments publish separate sustainability reports\nwhich provide further information on their respective sustainability activities and projects.\nApplication of international reporting frameworks\nDue to the different materiality requirements set out in the GRI Standards, United Nations Global\nCompact (UNGC), and Germany\u2019s CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), neither the\nBeiersdorf Group nor Beiersdorf AG applied any international frameworks in accordance with section\n315c(3) of the HGB in conjunction with section 289d of the HGB to prepare the Non-financial Statement.\nThe Consumer Business Segment, however, follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards in\nits broader sustainability reporting and publishes a separate GRI index.\nBoth business segments are United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) members and report on their\nachievements and measures taken in the reporting period in order to implement the ten princi-\nples of the UNGC in the areas of human rights, working conditions, environmental protection, and\nanti-corruption. This Non-financial Statement systematically and comprehensively fulfills the UNGC\nCommunication on Progress (CoP) requirements for the Beiersdorf Group.\nMaterial non-financial topics for the business segments\nBoth business segments conduct materiality analyses to strategically identify and review sustainability\ntopics. In the Consumer Business Segment, such an analysis was last carried out in 2021. The f ollowing\nmaterial topics were identified during this process: Climate protection, circular economy, sustaina-\nble land use and biodiversity, sustainable use of water, diversity and inclusion, education and training,\nemployer attractiveness, occupational health and safety, safeguarding human rights, community\nengagement, compliance and business ethics, and product safety.\nThe tesa Business Segment last updated its materiality matrix with members of relevant specialist\ndepartments in 2020. The material non-financial topics identified are climate and energy, product\nsustainability, resource efficiency, water, employee development, diversity and equal opportuni-\nties, occupational health and safety, human rights, prevention of anticompetitive behavior, and\nproduct safety. For an overview of all material non-financial topics relating to the Consumer and\ntesa Business Segments, together with section and page references, please refer to our index to\nthe Non-financial Statement.\nStatement scope\nDisclosures on the material NFS topics are mainly provided separately for the tesa and Consumer\nBusiness Segments. In principle, all information is reported jointly for the Beiersdorf Group and\nBeiersdorf AG. Key figures that are collected separately for Beiersdorf AG are listed in the table\n\u201cRelevant Key Figures for the Non-financial Statement of the Beiersdorf AG\u201d.\n88 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\npose a threat to water are emptied, refilled, and stored only in areas that are equipped with appropriate\nretention tanks. We use equipment to measure turbidity and solvent concentration to ensure that con-\ntaminated surface water is not discharged into the sewer system. We have emergency plans in place\nto determine the exact course of action in the event of a leakage of substances hazardous to water. All\nthese measures are regularly reviewed in our external ISO 14001 audits and are a precondition for a\nsuccessful audit result.\nEmployees\nOur employees play a key role in the sustainable development of our company. Their expertise,\nskills, and commitment ensure that we remain competitive and innovative. Our goal is to create an\nattractive, inclusive workplace that recognizes the individual performance and actively promotes the\npotential of a diverse workforce.\nConsumer\nTraining and education\nThe changes in our working world require an agile and dynamic approach to work and thus a high\ndegree of flexibility and willingness to learn. This makes it all the more important to foster our\nemployees\u2019 personal strengths and invest in their long-term development. To this end, we offer\ncomprehensive training and development opportunities that also support lifelong learning.\nMore information on the key topic of training and development, as well as knowledge and learning,\ncan be found in the Combined Management Report in the section entitled \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d.\nEmployer attractiveness\nWe want to be an attractive employer for our employees and offer them a safe, attractive, and\ninclusive working environment where everyone feels they belong and has the same opportunities to\nsucceed and do their best work. We believe that this includes open dialogue across all levels in the\nspirit of participation and involvement, the achievement of jointly set goals, and a responsible man-\nagement culture. It is particularly important to us that our employees form an emotional bond with\nour company, so we regularly review this using global employee surveys.\nFurther information on the results of these surveys can be found in the \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d section\nof the Combined Management Report.\nDiversity and inclusion\nWe are convinced that a diverse workforce enriches our teamwork enormously. This is because\ndifferent perspectives and experiences not only make us more innovative, they also boost our\ncompetitiveness, make us more creative, and help us to better understand and take into account the\nneeds of our consumers. Diversity and inclusion are thus not only actively promoted but form a core\ncomponent of our business strategy.\nThe global D&I roadmap formulated in 2021 and further refined in the reporting year supports us in\ncreating a culture rooted in diversity and inclusion. It encompasses a number of strategic priorities\nthat are presented in more detail in the \u201cPeople at Beiersdorf\u201d section of the Combined Management\nReport. This section also contains the relevant key figures, such as the percentage of women in man-\nagement positions and the number of management vacancies filled internally.\n111 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\ntesa\nTraining and education\nCompetition for employees with scientific and technical backgrounds is constantly on the rise within\nour industry. The advance of digitalization and internationalization is also changing work require-\nments and methods. We are meeting these challenges with comprehensive education and further\ntraining programs, as highly qualified, committed, and performance-oriented employees represent\na decisive competitive advantage for tesa. In addition, a wide range of training and development\nopportunities help to ensure that high potentials enjoy working for us long term.\nThe tesa Group offers its own training at its production facilities in Hamburg and Offenburg; we are\nalso planning to roll out such a training program for tesa SE\u2019s corporate headquarters beginning in\n2023. The focus here is on technical professions, for example chemicals technician, electronics tech-\nnician for industrial engineering, industrial mechanic, machine and plant operator, and mechatronics\ntechnician. In addition, we offer cooperative degree programs and vocational training programs in\nbusiness-related fields, such as plastics and elastomer technology, electrical engineering, and IT\nsystems integration.\nOur goal is to hire our trainees upon completion of their training for the long term. This is also\nreflected in our retention rates: In Hamburg, 79% of the trainees who completed their training in 2022\nwere retained, while in Offenburg the retention rate stood at 54%.\nIn order to identify and fully tap our employees\u2019 potential, we offer them a wide range of profes-\nsional and personal development opportunities. Our programs are designed with specific target\ngroups and areas of expertise in mind and include, for example, basic training for new employees. All\nemployees can take advantage of in-person and online training courses, for example on compliance,\noccupational safety, sales, as well as management and leadership. Since the start of the COVID-19\npandemic, we have expanded the number of online courses offered in order to provide employees\nwith a variety of options, even when they are working from home. In addition, courses from the digital\nlearning platform LinkedIn Learning complement our own programs.\nDiversity and equal opportunities\nDifferent perspectives help us to better understand the needs of our customers and at the same\ntime increase tesa\u2019s innovative spirit. That is why we are committed to greater diversity and equal\nopportunities.\nWhen filling new positions, we make a point of hiring employees with different cultural backgrounds.\nThe share of non-German nationals in the workforce increased by 3.1 percentage points to 8.7%\nbetween December 2020 and December 2022. We want to consolidate this trend and, for example,\nadvertise all vacancies for certain higher-level positions exclusively in English.\nIn the coming years, we are going to step up our efforts to promote gender equality within the work-\nforce and in leadership roles. We have set ourselves the target of having women account for 30% of\nthe first level below the Executive Board and 35% of the second level at tesa SE by mid-2027.\nAttractive working environment\nAn appealing environment can contribute to employee well-being. That\u2019s why our workplaces are\nequipped with ergonomic and contemporary furniture and equipment, such as height-adjustable\ndesks and modern lighting and ventilation concepts. In addition, we offer employees a health man-\nagement program at our corporate headquarters in Norderstedt. This program includes ergonomic\ncounseling, colorectal cancer screenings, a health club, and massages. Company medical care as\n112 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nwell as internal and external psychosocial counseling and support are also part of the health man-\nagement program.\nIn addition, our employees at our headquarters in Norderstedt can, among other offerings, take\nadvantage of a cleaning service, visit regular market stalls to purchase regional fruit and vegetables,\nand utilize various mobility concepts. For example, they have the ability to charge EVs and e-bikes at a\ncompany charging point and park rental bikes from Hamburg\u2019s \u201cStadtrad\u201d initiative at a station on site.\nEmployees also have the option of leasing bicycles through a subsidized program.\nOccupational health and safety\nBeiersdorf bears a great responsibility for workplace safety and the health of our employees. That\nis why we view the two as a comprehensive, holistic, and preventive management task. Our strategic\nobjective is therefore to reduce the number of accidents at work to zero and avoid work-related\nillnesses as well as undue physical and psychological stress factors. To achieve this goal, we conduct\nregular audits to determine how we can make our workplaces even safer and healthier.\nOur accident frequency rate (AFR) documents all accidents at work that result in at least one day\u2019s\nabsence from work. In the Consumer Business Segment, our AFR sank in 2022 to 0.5 accidents per\nmillion hours worked. This represents a 45% reduction in AFR compared to the previous year. We\nare particularly pleased to report that 73% of our production centers operated completely acci-\ndent-free throughout all of 2022. At tesa, the AFR of documented accidents resulting in at least one\nday of absence at ISO 14001 certified sites stood at 3.6 per million working hours worldwide in the\nreporting year (2021: 4.1).\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe risks to our employees still associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are integrated into our safety\nand health management activities. Our local teams continue to monitor the situation, comply with\nlocal legislation, and adapt protective measures whenever necessary.\nConsumer\nDriven by our Care Beyond Skin business purpose and guided by our core values, we are committed to\nreducing potential safety risks and incidents. Our Global Occupational Safety Department is respon-\nsible for managing safety at the workplace, but we also count on the cooperation of all employees at\nour sites.\nOur occupational health and safety strategy applies worldwide. It encompasses our most impor-\ntant current measures and programs and serves as a basis for our sites to develop their own local\nimplementation plans and measures. We monitor the progress of these measures using indicators\nat a global level.\nAs part of our continuous improvement efforts, we focus on reducing the main risks associated\nwith slips, trips, falls, forklift operation, and machine operation. Within the framework of our\nbehavior-based safety program, we encourage all employees to participate and provide feedback.\nWe focus on ensuring that our employees make each other aware of both misconduct and exem-\nplary safety implementation.\nManagement systems\nIn 2022, we further increased our global standards and focused on defining work methodologies\nfor technological innovations such as collaborative robots (COBOTs). In addition, we expanded our\nrequirements for key activities such as warehousing and forklift operations. This helps our managers\nintegrate safety and health protection into day-to-day operations.\n113 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nRespect for human rights\nBeiersdorf actively promotes compliance with laws, codes of conduct, and human rights. This\nresponsibility is deeply anchored in how we see ourselves, as well as in our core values. This not\nonly applies to our own sites and employees around the world, but also to all employees along\nthe value chain. We do not tolerate any form of corruption, forced labor, child labor, or discrimina-\ntion \u2013 neither at our own locations nor at any point in our supply chain. Furthermore, we support\nthe health and safety of employees in the workplace, employees\u2019 right to freedom of association,\nincluding collective bargaining, and environmental protection. We are also committed to equal\nrights and treatment as well as diversity.\nUpholding human rights throughout the value chain\nWe primarily see risks relating to compliance with human rights in purchasing and procurement, for\nexample of raw materials or services \u2013 and thus in our supply chains. Our goal is to eliminate or mini-\nmize all threats to human rights to the greatest extent possible.\nDue to our responsibility as a multinational company that operates across the globe and the legal\nrequirements with respect to human rights due diligence, we reevaluated the risk of human rights\nviolations involving our employees and our supply chain in the reporting year. This was conducted as\npart of our annual risk management process. If minimum social standards are not met, it may affect\nthe safety, health, and well-being of employees. As a result of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence\nAct coming into force, human rights violations can now result not only in considerable damage to our\nreputation, but also in substantial fines for companies. We are responding to this risk with, among\nother measures, a task force that is preparing the company\u2019s internal processes for the additional\nrequirements imposed by the law. In addition, we implement numerous preventive measures when it\ncomes to human rights to reduce negative impacts as far as possible.\nAs mentioned in our \u201cDeclaration of Principles on Respect for Human Rights,\u201d we are not only a\nsignatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) but also steer our own business activities\nand our collaboration with business partners based on fundamental principles and guidelines. These\ninclude the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO)\nConventions, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In addition, we fully comply\nwith all regulations and official requirements applicable in specific countries.\nWe focus on long-term relationships with business partners who commit to and align with our prin-\nciples of sustainable, responsible corporate governance and explicitly promote these. The internal\nand external codes of conduct for our employees and our suppliers contain binding requirements\non upholding human rights.\nWe require our business partners to meet our standards and communicate them to their upstream\nsupply chains. This applies both in terms of required product quality as well as transparent, fair,\nand responsible business practices. In this way, we want to ensure that our business partners live\nup to their social, environmental, and economic responsibilities \u2013 and ultimately manufacture\nhigh-quality products.\nConsumer\nConsumer Business Segment creates binding standards\nWith our Code of Conduct for Business Partners (CoC), the Consumer Business Segment has commit-\nted all our business partners along the supply chain with an annual purchasing volume of more than\n\u20ac 50,000 to comply fully with our standards. The CoC is aligned with our core values and establishes\nuniform, binding criteria for responsible business activities, including critical aspects such as prohibiting\n119 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\ncorruption, child labor, forced labor, and discrimination as well as promoting occupational health and\nsafety, the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and environmental protection.\nIn 2022, we procured more than 90% of our goods and services through partners who have explicitly\ncommitted to our CoC; we aim to increase this share in the future. We also revised the CoC in the\nreporting year to meet the requirements of Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act which came\ninto force on January 1, 2023.\nRisk screenings and audits\nIn addition, environmental protection and occupational safety audits have been carried out at all\nBeiersdorf Consumer facilities since 2013. These audits are aligned with the requirements of the\nEnvironmental Protection and Safety Management Audit Scheme (ESMAS), which are based on the\ninternationally recognized ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) and ISO 45001 (occupa-\ntional health and safety management systems) standards.\nESMAS audits verify whether appropriate measures are implemented to guarantee compliance with\nour globally applicable environmental as well as occupational health and safety standards at our sites.\nDuring the reporting year, Beiersdorf\u2019s production sites in Hamburg and Berlin (Germany), Argentona\n(Spain), Sanand (India), Bangplee (Thailand), Malang (Indonesia), Shanghai (China), Itatiba (Brazil),\nMexico City (Mexico) and Lagos (Nigeria) were audited in accordance with the ESMAS standard.\nIn addition to the ESMAS audits, our facilities in Germany (Hamburg and Berlin), Spain (Argentona and\nTres Cantos), India, Indonesia, China, Brazil and Nigeria were audited in the reporting year in accord-\nance with the standardized 4-pillar audit protocol of the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA).\nAll of the audits performed are valid for three years and are therefore repeated every three years.\nThe Vice Presidents of the functions Sustainability and Procurement are responsible for sustainability\nin our overall sourcing operations and throughout the supply chain. A risk classification assessment\nis performed on all of our more than 21,000 direct suppliers; it examines whether more in-depth\nscreening and thus further measures beyond signing the CoC are required. Country-specific risks,\nthe quantity of goods purchased, and the proximity of the respective goods or service companies to\nBeiersdorf\u2019s brands are risks that all play a role in the risk classification process. Direct suppliers with a\nmedium risk rating must submit a comprehensive self-disclosure via the Sedex or EcoVadis platforms.\nOn this basis, we conduct a more detailed risk assessment, which the Responsible Sourcing team then\nuses to decide whether a subsequent audit is required. Direct supplier facilities with a high risk rating\nare required to undergo an on-site audit.\nTo ensure objectivity, the audits are carried out by independent certified auditors according to the\nstandardized SMETA 4-pillar audit protocol. The results of the audits highlight concrete challenges\nand fields for action and serve as a basis for the joint development of action plans with our suppliers.\nIn extreme cases, audit results may lead to the termination of business relationships. By leveraging\ninternational collaboration platforms such as Sedex, EcoVadis, and AIM-PROGRESS, we can con-\ntinuously improve our sustainability engagement right along the supply chain. In addition, we are\ncurrently restructuring the risk classification process. The goal is to integrate even more external\ninsights, indices, and data sources and make our processes even more robust from 2023 onward.\ntesa\nDesigning procurement processes in a responsible manner\nWe require direct suppliers to the tesa Business Segment to sign our Code of Conduct for Suppliers\n(CoCS). The CoCS forms the foundation for designing our global procurement processes in a\nresponsible manner and outlines fundamental rules and commitments in the areas of human rights,\nlabor standards, environmental protection and the prevention of corruption. It is based on the ten\n120 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nprinciples of the UN Global Compact, the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO),\nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We expect our suppliers to comply with our\nstandards and to remedy any shortcomings. In this context, we are implementing our own auditing\nprocess. In light of Germany\u2019s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, we also expanded the CoCS in\nthe reporting year and thus made the issue of human rights even more relevant. The new CoCS will\nbe valid from 2023.\nOur supply chains are global and complex, as we source raw materials, products, and services from\nall over the world. By working together closely, we aim to establish long-term, trusting partnerships\nwith regular suppliers. Our goal is to ensure that product quality, supply reliability, and our shared\ncommitment to sustainable growth remains on a high level.\nThe rules for our global procurement processes are defined and described in the Purchasing Com-\npliance Guideline (PCG), which also forms part of our Group-wide Compliance Manual. This policy\ncontains binding rules of conduct for tesa\u2019s procurement activities and is reviewed and revised on\nan ongoing basis.\nMore transparent supply chains\nWe not only require our major suppliers to comply with the tesa CoCS, our goal is also to gradually\nincrease transparency and sustainability across our entire supply chain.\nIn the reporting year, we introduced a systematic assessment process for our approximately\n10,000 suppliers. In this process, our Procurement and Sustainability Departments examine whether\na more in-depth risk analysis of the suppliers is necessary. This supplier screening process is carried\nout once a year and as required, for example in the case of new suppliers. In addition to risks specific\nto individual countries and industries, the quantity of goods purchased also plays a role in classi-\nfication, which extends across the risk categories very low, low, medium low, medium high, high,\nand very high. Factors such as strategic relevance are also included, for example if the company is a\nsupplier for an important raw material or a single-source supplier.\nWe have already been inviting direct suppliers to complete an assessment via the EcoVadis platform\nsince 2020. Suppliers with a good rating can thus demonstrate the extent to which they uphold\nhuman rights, maintain fair working conditions, and take environmental aspects into account, as well\nas responsibly produce and procure their products, raw materials, and services. In the future, these\ninvitations will be linked to risk factors in an even more targeted manner.\nAt the end of 2022, suppliers that are responsible for 54% (2021: 43%) of our direct purchasing volume\nhad submitted EcoVadis assessments. In the coming years, our aim is to gradually increase this figure,\nwith a goal of having sustainability assessments completed for a total of 80% of our direct purchasing\nvolume by 2025. Furthermore, our goal is that by 2030, 80% of our purchasing volume will be sourced\nexclusively from suppliers who meet our responsible supply chain standards - this means that, among\nother things, they have an EcoVadis assessment of at least 45 points.\nCompliance\nThe following Compliance section applies to both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments. Both\nBusiness Segments have established their own independent compliance management systems (CMS),\nwhich follow uniform standards and are implemented in close alignment between the two respective\nCorporate Compliance Management teams. Differences in the precise design of the CMS of the two\nBusiness Segments are described below, insofar as they exist.\n\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nOur Core Values for responsible conduct\nFor us, compliance means observing legal and commercial provisions and rules \u2013 and doing so\nwithout compromise. Both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments have established a respective\nCode of Conduct (CoC) to ensure compliance with these standards and to fulfill our social responsi-\nbility as a company in the best possible way. As an overarching value framework, the CoC is intended\nto guide everyone at the company when carrying our business activities. Furthermore, it supports all\nour employees, managers, and corporate bodies in complying with and living by the core principles\nand values of the Business Segments. As a directive for our actions, the CoC contributes to affirming\nour company\u2019s status now and in the future as a trusted partner to our customers, business partners,\nshareholders, and further stakeholders.\nGroup-wide compliance management\nOur Group-wide CMS is based on established standards such as the IDW AsS 980. We follow these\nguiding principles:\n\u2022 Prevent: Preventive measures are anchored in our management system to avoid wrongdoing.\n\u2022 Detect: We use risk analyses to detect and manage material compliance risks Group-wide. Addi-\ntional control instruments help reveal noncompliant behavior.\n\u2022 React and Improve: We penalize any violations of statutory or internal regulations as appropriate\nin each individual case. In addition, we continuously develop improvement measures for the\nentire CMS. We see our compliance management system as an important contribution to acting\nin a sustainable and forward-looking manner and thus living up to our tradition as a reliable and\ntrustworthy company.\nPrevent\nAntitrust law continues to be an important compliance issue for both parts of the Group. The\nreasons for this are our business models, legal complexity, the continually increasing prosecution\nactivity worldwide, as well as the potential for sanctions by antitrust authorities. In addition to\nantitrust law, preventing corruption and acting in accordance with privacy laws are two other focal\npoints of our compliance programs. These programs serve to specifically raise the awareness of our\nrelevant employee groups to these topics and to provide them with both the confidence to act and\nmake decisions.\nOur Corporate Compliance departments are responsible for defining, developing, and monitoring the\nminimum standards for these programs, as well as an appropriate CMS in their respective organization.\nIn our regions and at our affiliates, we have established local compliance officers who are responsible for\ncommunicating all elements of the compliance programs to our employees and working to ensure that\nthey are applied locally. The aim is to enshrine all elements of our compliance system in the regions and\naffiliates and to monitor and improve them on an ongoing basis. A special network of external attorneys\nspecialized in antitrust issues is available to local companies. Practice-oriented training and consulting\nservices as well as various guidelines form the core elements of our compliance programs:\n\u2022 The antitrust guidelines provide clear directives on antitrust-compliant behavior, requirements\nfor contact and the exchange of information with competitors, guidance for communication with\ncustomers, for example, with regard to sale prices, as well as fundamental dos and don\u2019ts.\n\u2022 The anti-corruption guidelines serve as a guide to dealing with gifts, product samples, and invita-\ntions from and to representatives and employees of other companies or public officials. They also\ncontain information on how to deal with conflicts of interest.\n122 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\n\u2022 The data protection guidelines describe, in particular, how the principles of the European Union\u2019s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are implemented for the lawful processing of data at\nour EU companies. These guidelines direct and instruct our employees on how to handle data in a\nlegally compliant manner. In addition, the data protection teams have established internal partner-\nships with key data protection functions such as Cyber Security and Procurement.\nWe have implemented a comprehensive, target group-specific training concept. Taking a risk-oriented\napproach, we train an average of several thousand employees worldwide annually on corruption\nprevention as well as antitrust and data protection-compliant behavior. This training is delivered\nface-to-face or in an e-learning format and it serves to raise our employees\u2019 awareness of the topic\nand to show them where to obtain further support. In addition, Members of the Executive Board and\nSupervisory Board are regularly informed about relevant compliance matters. In the fiscal year 2022,\nthe Consumer Business Segment achieved a total training participation rate of 97% and tesa of 99%.\nThe total participation rate applies to the target and risk group defined in advance for the respective\ncompliance fields of antitrust law, anti-corruption, and data protection. This includes all employees\nand managers who may come into contact with the respective issues and requirements.\nOur employees can find key guidance and information on the relevant compliance intranet pages.\nIn addition, we use various communication channels such as the intranet and email to inform our\nworkforce regularly about compliance topics and related new developments. Furthermore, we\nregularly exchange information with our local affiliates on generally relevant updates, emerging\nquestions, or best-practice approaches, for example.\nThese ongoing communication and training measures help us institutionalize the compliance principles\nat our companies.\nDetect\nThe analysis of compliance risks forms the basis of our compliance management system and our\ncompliance programs. To this end, we regularly identify existing and future compliance risk areas in\nour business models and our geographical presence as part of a holistic compliance risk assessment.\nIn addition, both Corporate Compliance departments support their management teams in identifying\nrisks that go beyond their own organizational responsibility.\nIn a second step, these are then evaluated and prioritized. High-priority issues are analyzed for their\nspecific risks in order to ensure that appropriate countermeasures exist or are taken. This is carried\nout both centrally and at the affiliates. The results are presented to the Executive Board and leveraged\nto continually adapt and improve our global and local compliance programs.\nIn order to operate in a fully compliant manner over the long term and maintain and further promote\nan open and trusting compliance and communication culture, it is essential that individual employees\nare personally committed to the issue. This also includes reporting possible compliance violations\nand other complaints \u2013 even anonymously, if they so desire. To this end, we have established and\ncommunicated various reporting systems.\nFor example, the Consumer Business Segment launched the \u201cSpeak up. We care.\u201d whistleblowing\nplatform that can be accessed from anywhere in the world around the clock. The tesa Business Segment\nhas also been using this platform since this reporting period. Furthermore, external ombudspersons\nreceived confidential information on potential compliance violations on behalf of tesa until 31.10.2022.\nThe whistleblowing platforms are available not only to our own employees but also to customers,\nconsumers, suppliers, and other external stakeholders for the purpose of reporting possible\nmisconduct. Besides the above, we also provide internal options for reporting such as Corporate\nCompliance email addresses.\n123 ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\nWe have established processes to investigate and clarify any information received and ensure that\nappropriate measures are taken, following careful consideration. Relevant specialist functions and the\nCorporate Auditing Department are usually involved in the investigation.\nCorporate Auditing is another independent monitoring function within Beiersdorf AG. This depart-\nment conducts regular audits of both Business Segments, of which compliance-relevant topics form\nan integral part. In addition, each Corporate Compliance Department regularly monitors compliance\nwith centrally defined minimum standards, through on-site visits or queries about the implementation\nof measures, for instance.\nReact and improve\nWe closely monitor the effectiveness of our compliance management system by means of our regular\nGroup-wide compliance reporting. The results are reported to the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard. These reports document compliance incidents as well as the status of our compliance programs\ncentrally and at affiliates worldwide. We derive further courses of action based on this information\nand implement appropriate measures. The affiliates are naturally required to inform the Corporate\nCompliance Department immediately about any material compliance incidents, including outside the\nregular reporting cycles, in order to be able to respond immediately.\nWe consider the continual and thorough development of our compliance management systems as an\nintegral part of our activities. This is how we take internal adaptation requirements into account, as\nwell as the dynamic changes in legal frameworks and economic conditions. In the reporting year, we\ndeveloped formalized audit formats for this purpose in the Consumer Business Segment and carried\nthem out at select affiliates. On the basis of the formats, we analyze the effectiveness of antitrust and\ndata protection compliance and improve it on an ongoing basis. At tesa, we revised the data privacy\nguidelines, the whistleblowing guidelines, and the case management process. We also reviewed the\nstatus of local compliance implementation at certain affiliates.\nOther Issues\nProduct Safety\nOur highest priority is to provide safe products that are fully compatible with our consumers\u2019 health\nand the environment. All our products therefore need to comply with numerous statutory require-\nments before they can receive official market approval. Both Business Segments apply high standards\nin this regard.\nConsumer\nIn this respect, our understanding of quality goes beyond the evaluation and approval of our\nproducts. We understand quality as a dynamic process that contributes to continuous improvement\nand express this understanding in the Beiersdorf Quality Policy. It guides our Executive Board, our\nmanagement, and all our employees in their daily activities.\nIt also serves to maintain and build on our consumers\u2019 satisfaction and high level of trust, and to\nensure that we remain competitive in the future.\nSafety evaluation of all raw materials and cosmetic product formulas\nTo ensure that we meet our own strict requirements regarding the quality of our products, we employ\na team of experienced, highly qualified safety assessors. First, this team must perform the legally\nrequired evaluation and approval of the raw materials, formulas, packaging materials, and product\nclaims, thereby verifying their safety and compatibility for consumers. Only then do the safety asses-\nsors approve the finished products for distribution. This is done primarily in accordance with the\n124"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

Strategy\nThe contribution of the two economic activities considered for\nEnvironmental Objective II is subsumed in the contribution re!\nported for Environmental Objective I. Regardless of the taxonomy\ncriteria, the BMW Group regularly and comprehensively addresses\nrisks arising from climate change and their potential impact on its\nlocations and supply chains.\n! DNSH adaptation to climate change, ! TCFD climate risks\nAs the overview tables from Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178\ndo not provide a detailed picture of the BMW Group\u2019s business\nmodel per economic activity, the following table provides detailed\ninformation about the three performance indicators for both eco!\n\u2014 Economic activity 6.5, \u201cTransport by motorbikes, passenger\ncars and light commercial vehicles\u201d\nThe Taxonomy!aligned shares for the three performance\nindicators were at a low single!digit level for the Financial\nServices segment. This was due to the fact that \u2013 compared\nto the Automotive segment \u2013 there is a time lag before the\neffects of the vehicle fleet electrification ramp!up are felt in\nthe financing and leasing lines of business. A further reason\nis the stricter DNSH requirements for economic activity 6.5,\nin particular those relating to environmental objective V\n\u201cPollution prevention and control\u201d, which lead to the exclu!\nsion of all PHEV and a significant restriction in the recognition\nof BEV in the scope of EU Taxonomy reporting (for details see\nSection \u201cAvoidance of significant harm\u201d). In addition, with\neconomic activity 6.5, third!party brands can only be included\nin the vehicle portfolio under restrictive conditions, such as\nfor the purpose of assigning tyre categories or WLTP\nemissions values as part of the process of testing compliance\nwith the DNSH criteria. As a result, no specific deductions\ncan be allocated, with the consequence that the models con!\ncerned must be excluded from the scope of reporting on Tax!\nonomy alignment.\nnomic activities.\n\n\nSupply chains and supplier network\nThe year 2022 was dominated by fragile supply chains and rising\nprices for many materials. The cost drivers for the BMW Group\u2019s\nPurchasing team were primarily the price hikes seen for raw ma!\nterials, semiconductors, energy and transportation coupled with\na challenging supply situation. The combined impact of supply\nbottlenecks for semiconductor components, the temporarily\nrestricted availability of wire harnesses owing to the war in\nUkraine, and pandemic!related lockdowns in China led to pro!\nduction interruptions worldwide, particularly in the first half of the\nyear. Although the situation eased slightly during the second six!\nmonth period, global supply chains remained in a fragile state.\n! Outlook, ! Risks and opportunities\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com!\nponents close to its production sites to the extent possible and\nis therefore represented by local teams in all its key purchasing\nmarkets, in order to identify risks promptly and respond flexibly\nto the respective market circumstances. In the face of geostra!\ntegic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group\u2019s supply chains\nis also becoming increasingly important and the BMW Group\ntakes this fact into account when selecting its partners.\nIn!house production: a competitive advantage\nThe BMW Group regularly examines its range of products in\nterms of their profitability and strategic importance. A special\nfocus is currently on e!mobility. In this central area of transfor!\nmation, the BMW Group is building up its own skill sets in stra!\ntegically important components, particularly in areas where tech!\nnology is not competitively available on the market. The in!house\nproduction of certain key components also helps us to improve\nthe level of supply security and thus gain a competitive advan!\ntage. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen our pro!\ncess!related expertise in technologies relevant for quality man!\nagement within the supplier network.\nQuality assurance\nQuality is a vital competitive factor and of key importance for\nensuring customer satisfaction. Our quality experts monitor the\nentire product development process, including the phases of in!\ndustrialisation and series production. Regular visits to suppliers\nand a preventive, systematic review of all processes are aimed\nat ensuring the agreed quality.\n\n  The volatile situation on energy and raw materials markets had\na major impact on purchasing over the course of 2022. There are\nsigns of increasing competition for the raw materials required to\ndrive forward electric mobility. With the help of measures such\nas the direct purchase of lithium and cobalt, the BMW Group is\nmaking itself technologically and regionally less dependent on\nindividual deposits and suppliers. Direct purchasing in Australia,\nArgentina and Morocco underpin our dual intention of securing\nraw material supplies, whilst also maintaining our high sustain!\nability standards, particularly in supply chains involving critical\nraw materials. At the same time, the BMW Group analyses the\ndevelopment of raw materials prices and hedges against price\nfluctuations \u2013 provided the capital market offers the opportunity\nto do so. ! Raw materials price risks and opportunities\n* Direct and indirect purchasing;\nthis includes the entire year 2022 for BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n   \n   Production and Supplier Network\n 111\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nOur commitment to upholding environmental and social\nstandards as well as human rights in our raw materials supply\nchains is enshrined in the ! BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct and\nthe ! High#level commitment to sustainable natural rubber among\nothers. The BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct also requires\nTier!1 suppliers to demand minimum standards within their\nsub!supplier chains.\nAnnual risk analyses regarding the BMW Group\u2019s sustainability\nstandards are the starting point for raw materials!related hedg!\ning activities that are designed to reduce environmental and\nhuman rights risks. Key levers in this respect are to forgo, sub!\nstitute or reduce the use of primary risk raw materials. We also\nfocus in particular on cooperating closely with our partners in the\nsupplier network as well as in multi!stakeholder initiatives and\nprojects. We use scientific findings to gain an even better under!\nstanding of the raw material extraction process and to take it into\naccount accordingly when analysing the level of risk in order to\nfurther reduce any negative impacts.\nThe BMW Group places a particular focus on so!called \u201cconflict\nminerals\u201d and uses standardised Responsible Minerals Initiative\n(RMI) tools to ensure that the raw materials deployed can be\ntraced back to the smelter. It uses existing certifications to ensure\nthe origin of other raw materials. The BMW Group is also involved\nin developing certified standards for critical stages of the value\nchain, for example as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining\nAssurance (IRMA), and subsequently applies them. Further de!\ntails and raw materials profiles are available ! online. ! SASB Index\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a\npositive impact for selected raw materials through our involve!\nment in local development projects. During the year under report,\nfor example, we initiated a project with a locally based NGO to\nimprove living conditions associated with the mining of the raw\nmaterial mica in India.\nPurchasing battery cells\nAs of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new generation of\nbattery cells. We have therefore concluded agreements with our\npartners that guarantee annual production capacities of 40 GWh\nin Europe, 40 GWh in China and 30 GWh in the USA. Via this\nstrategy, the Company is reinforcing its \u201clocal for local\u201d approach\nby sourcing battery cells regionally where our production facilities\nare located. The BMW Group will also use secondary raw mate!\nrials to replace the primary raw materials cobalt, lithium and\nnickel in the new generation of battery cells and purchase green\nelectricity in order to further reduce the size of our carbon foot!\nprint in the supply chain. ! Carbon emissions in the supply chain\nSupply security\nTo cushion the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine on our\nEuropean plants, the BMW Group has introduced a comprehen!\nsive raft of measures with its partners and therefore continues\nto source components from western Ukraine. At the same time,\nour partners have established additional production sites outside\nUkraine and the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has\nreturned to normal as a result.\nLockdowns in China designed to contain the coronavirus pan!\ndemic kept supply chains on tenterhooks, not to mention the\nchallenging supply situation for semiconductors. In an effort to\nmitigate the worldwide shortage of semiconductors, among other\nmeasures the BMW Group has entered into supply agreements\ninvolving increased levels of buffer stock when placing orders, as\nwell as the direct purchase of strategically important semicon!\nductors.\n\nCooperation in the supplier network based on trust and the de!\nvelopment of new partnerships is essential for us when it comes\nto swiftly deploying innovations in the products on offer. In this\ncontext, we work closely with the ! BMW Startup Garage and ! BMW\ni Ventures. At Newcomer Day 2022, selected start!ups presented\na broad range of future technologies \u2013 including our new partner\nfor innovative natural fibre composite solutions.\nThe highly innovative achievements of start!ups are also reflected\nin the ! BMW Supplier Innovation Award. During the year under report,\nvarious companies won awards in the categories of e!mobility,\nsustainability, digitalisation, customer experience, exceptional\nteam performance and Newcomer of the Year, which are essen!\ntial for driving forward transformation.\n    \n    Production and Supplier Network\n112\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\n  Digitalisation in the supply chain\nA digital flow of information throughout the supply chain is a\nprerequisite for more resilient and flexible supply chain manage!\nment.\n! Catena#X is one of the largest ongoing projects in the automotive\nindustry. It is open to all BMW Group partners and designed to\nenable data exchange across the various levels of the value chain\nbetween automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. With the\nplatform due to be launched in 2023, Catena!X is expected to\noffer an end!to!end solution that will lead to closer and even\nmore coordinated cooperation between partners. One of our aims\nis to improve transparency and response speed by regularly com!\nparing the demand and capacity situation in order to adjust the\nsupply of parts at short notice. Further improvements are expect!\ned for the network partners, whether raw materials suppliers,\nn!Tier suppliers or automotive manufacturers, for example in\nterms of delivery reliability and customer satisfaction. At the\nsame time, costs can be effectively cut by improving capacity\nutilisation and avoiding special procurement processes. Record!\ning carbon emissions data in supply chains enables measures\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions to be agreed upon and their\neffectiveness verified going forward. The BMW Group has already\nbegun preparations for the pilot tests of the initial applications.\nSocial and environmental responsibility\nThe BMW Group considers responsible supply chain manage!\nment as an integral part of good corporate governance. Against\nthe backdrop of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferket!\ntensorgfaltspflichtengesetz), the BMW Group continued to de!\nvelop its well!established processes during the year under report.\nThe BMW Group\u2019s requirements and the expectations it places\non its suppliers are set out in the ! BMW Group Supplier Code of Con#\nduct. ! GRI Index: 2#23, 3#3, 407#1, 408#1\nDue diligence in the supplier network\nA multi!stage due diligence process has been established across\nall relevant areas of the organisation to delineate our responsi!\nbility for the supplier network. A comprehensive description of\nthe due diligence process can be found ! online.\nThe BMW Group is committed to the application of standardised\nprocedures and a cooperative approach with a view to imple!\nmenting the due diligence obligations that are integrated in its\nbusiness processes and avoiding redundant activities. For this\nreason, we engage in the Sector Dialogue Automotive Industry\ninitiative, for example to develop guidelines for action and create\nan industry!wide grievance mechanism.\n\u2014 Risk analysis\nThe BMW Group monitors and assesses sustainability and\nhuman rights risks in its supplier network, including its busi!\nness relationships with both potential and active supplier\nlocations. Among other strategies, we use risk filters and\nmedia analyses to identify abstract environmental and hu!\nman rights risks, as well as standardised sustainability ques!\ntionnaires and audits to conduct specific risk analysis at our\nTier!1 suppliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for\nanalysing risks at n!Tier suppliers.\n! GRI Index: 2#24, 308#1, 414#1\n\u2014 Prevention and remediation\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW Group, suppliers are\nrequired to implement any necessary preventive or remedial\nmeasures to minimise potential risks or eliminate any deficits\nthat may have been identified \u2013 including those in the areas\nof corporate governance, human rights and working condi!\ntions, health and safety, and environmental protection \u2013 by\nan agreed target date, no later than the start of production,\nand to demand that these measures are also complied with\nby subcontractors. ! Further GRI Information, ! Sustainability\nassessment of relevant supplier sites The extent of the preventive\nmeasures is partially based on the potential risks, the nature\nand scope of the business activity and the size of the suppli!\ner. Alongside its preventive measures, the BMW Group offers\na training programme on sustainability in the supply chain\naimed at internal buyers and process partners as well as\nsuppliers. ! GRI Index: 2#24, 308#2, 414#2\n\u2014 Effectiveness and grievance mechanisms\nFor suppliers operating in high!risk regions or high!risk prod!\nuct groups, the BMW Group has implemented additional\ncontrol mechanisms, such as audits of environmental and\nsocial standards at supplier locations using its own auditors\nor external auditors. The Group reviewed a total of 49 poten!\ntial and active supplier locations via this method during the\nyear under report (2021: 38)1, 2. We have set ourselves the\ntarget of ensuring that all Tier!1 supplier sites that have been\naudited meet the locally applicable legal requirements for\nsustainability as well as international human rights standards\n(BMW Group minimum requirements). In 2022, the final au!\ndits confirmed that all cases of non!compliance with mini!\nmum requirements (non!conformities) that were identified in\ninitial audits had been redressed.\nThe internal Human Rights Contact Supply Chain unit deals\nwith any indications of possible violations of the sustainability\nrequirements stipulated by the BMW Group for the supplier\nnetwork. We also use the standardised RBA Voices grievance\nmechanism as a complementary measure. In addition,\n! whistle#blower systems to detect possible legal violations are in\nplace and compliance checks performed. Our aim is to ensure\nthat any substantiated reports of environmental or human\nrights violations are redressed by agreeing on corrective\nmeasures.\n\n Our employees continue to play a key role in ensuring that diver!\nsity, equal opportunity and inclusion are actively practised. Many\nemployees are involved in internal networks that have been set\nup, including a number of women\u2019s networks at various locations\nand the BMW Group PRIDE group, which campaigns across bor!\nders for the interests of the LGBTIQ+2 community. The dialogue\ngenerated by these internal networks creates further momentum\nfor the BMW Group\u2019s commitment to this area.\nConcepts to promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion\nhave also been developed in relation to the composition of the\nBoard of Management and Supervisory Board. Information on\nthe stipulated diversity criteria and their implementation is pro!\nvided in the ! Corporate Governance Statement.\n! GRI Index: 3#3, 405#1\nIncreasing the share of women\nThe BMW Group is working continuously to increase the share\nof women in the workforce as a whole and in management func!\ntions in particular. This remains a challenging task in that it is still\nthe case that more men go through the process of vocational\ntraining, particularly in technical fields, and are therefore in the\nmajority on the market.\nThe BMW Group has set targets for the percentage share of\nwomen at all levels of the Company. By 2025, we aim to increase\nthe share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole to\nbetween 20 and 22 % and to between 17 to 19 % for BMW AG.\nWe aim to boost the share of women holding management\npositions in the BMW Group to 22 % by 2025, and to 20 % for\nBMW AG.\nThe share of women in management functions 3 within the\nBMW Group has been rising steadily for many years. Globally,\nthe share of female managers in the BMW Group stood at 20.2 %\nat the end of the year under report (2021: 18.8 %). During the\nperiod from 2011 to 2022, the number of women in management\npositions in BMW AG has more than doubled.\nExpressed as a percentage, the share of female managers at\nBMW AG was 18.2 % at the end of 2022 (2021: 17.5 %).\nThe share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole\nreached 18.6 % (2021: 19.7 %). For BMW AG, the share was\n16.5 % (2021: 16.0 %). ! Further GRI Information\nThe BMW Group is also aware of the need to achieve a high per!\ncentage of women in our future talents programmes. By doing\nso, we aim to ensure that the share of women in the total\nworkforce and in management functions continues to rise in the\nfuture. The proportion remained high in the trainee programme\n(Global Leader Development Programme 5) in 2022 at 45 %\n(2021: 47 %). The same applied to the student support pro!\ngrammes (Fastlane, SpeedUp), with a proportion of around 31 %\n(2021: 32 %). For our vocational training in STEM subjects (sci!\nence, technology, engineering and mathematics), the share of\nwomen at BMW AG in 2022 was 16.1 % (2021: 15.6 %), and 16.4 %\n(2021: 16.1 %) in the BMW Group 6.\n1 The share of employees with severe disabilities is based on the statutory requirements in accordance\nwith the German Social Code (SGB IX).\n2 Abbreviation for all sexual orientations and forms of identity.\n3 For a definition of the term management functions, please refer to the !

Climate#related risks and opportunities.\n \n Risks and Opportunities\n131\nMATERIAL SHORT,TERM\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\nThe overall risk situation for the BMW Group deteriorated signif!\nicantly as compared with the previous year.\nConsistently high inflation with lower real incomes and a corre!\nsponding widespread drop in demand may have a negative im!\npact on sales volumes and result in unfavourable price and prod!\nuct mix effects. Considerable uncertainties remain in the form of\npotential supply bottlenecks along the entire supply chain. Higher\nprices for energy, raw materials and transport may have a neg!\native impact. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, as\nwell as the progression of the coronavirus pandemic may also\nsignificantly affect the global economy. However, if the effect of\nthese issues were to prove less severe in 2023 than currently\nexpected, opportunities could arise that could benefit both rev!\nenues and earnings.\nOverall, no risks capable of threatening the continued existence\nof the BMW Group were identified either at the balance sheet\ndate or at the date on which the Group Financial Statements were\ndrawn up. The Management and the Supervisory Board do not\nsee any threat to the BMW Group\u2019s status as a going concern.\nAs in the previous year, the current set of risks to the BMW Group\nare considered to be manageable.

The cost drivers for the BMW Group\u2019s\nPurchasing team were primarily the price hikes seen for raw ma!\nterials, semiconductors, energy and transportation coupled with\na challenging supply situation. The combined impact of supply\nbottlenecks for semiconductor components, the temporarily\nrestricted availability of wire harnesses owing to the war in\nUkraine, and pandemic!related lockdowns in China led to pro!\nduction interruptions worldwide, particularly in the first half of the\nyear. Although the situation eased slightly during the second six!\nmonth period, global supply chains remained in a fragile state.\n! Outlook, ! Risks and opportunities\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com!\nponents close to its production sites to the extent possible and\nis therefore represented by local teams in all its key purchasing\nmarkets, in order to identify risks promptly and respond flexibly\nto the respective market circumstances. In the face of geostra!\ntegic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group\u2019s supply chains\nis also becoming increasingly important and the BMW Group\ntakes this fact into account when selecting its partners.\nIn!house production: a competitive advantage\nThe BMW Group regularly examines its range of products in\nterms of their profitability and strategic importance. A special\nfocus is currently on e!mobility. In this central area of transfor!\nmation, the BMW Group is building up its own skill sets in stra!\ntegically important components, particularly in areas where tech!\nnology is not competitively available on the market. The in!house\nproduction of certain key components also helps us to improve\nthe level of supply security and thus gain a competitive advan!\ntage. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen our pro!\ncess!related expertise in technologies relevant for quality man!\nagement within the supplier network.\nQuality assurance\nQuality is a vital competitive factor and of key importance for\nensuring customer satisfaction. Our quality experts monitor the\nentire product development process, including the phases of in!\ndustrialisation and series production. Regular visits to suppliers\nand a preventive, systematic review of all processes are aimed\nat ensuring the agreed quality.\n\n  The volatile situation on energy and raw materials markets had\na major impact on purchasing over the course of 2022. There are\nsigns of increasing competition for the raw materials required to\ndrive forward electric mobility. With the help of measures such\nas the direct purchase of lithium and cobalt, the BMW Group is\nmaking itself technologically and regionally less dependent on\nindividual deposits and suppliers. Direct purchasing in Australia,\nArgentina and Morocco underpin our dual intention of securing\nraw material supplies, whilst also maintaining our high sustain!\nability standards, particularly in supply chains involving critical\nraw materials. At the same time, the BMW Group analyses the\ndevelopment of raw materials prices and hedges against price\nfluctuations \u2013 provided the capital market offers the opportunity\nto do so. ! Raw materials price risks and opportunities\n* Direct and indirect purchasing;\nthis includes the entire year 2022 for BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n   \n   Production and Supplier Network\n 111\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nOur commitment to upholding environmental and social\nstandards as well as human rights in our raw materials supply\nchains is enshrined in the ! BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct and\nthe ! High#level commitment to sustainable natural rubber among\nothers. The BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct also requires\nTier!1 suppliers to demand minimum standards within their\nsub!supplier chains.\nAnnual risk analyses regarding the BMW Group\u2019s sustainability\nstandards are the starting point for raw materials!related hedg!\ning activities that are designed to reduce environmental and\nhuman rights risks. Key levers in this respect are to forgo, sub!\nstitute or reduce the use of primary risk raw materials. We also\nfocus in particular on cooperating closely with our partners in the\nsupplier network as well as in multi!stakeholder initiatives and\nprojects. We use scientific findings to gain an even better under!\nstanding of the raw material extraction process and to take it into\naccount accordingly when analysing the level of risk in order to\nfurther reduce any negative impacts.\nThe BMW Group places a particular focus on so!called \u201cconflict\nminerals\u201d and uses standardised Responsible Minerals Initiative\n(RMI) tools to ensure that the raw materials deployed can be\ntraced back to the smelter. It uses existing certifications to ensure\nthe origin of other raw materials. The BMW Group is also involved\nin developing certified standards for critical stages of the value\nchain, for example as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining\nAssurance (IRMA), and subsequently applies them. Further de!\ntails and raw materials profiles are available ! online. ! SASB Index\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a\npositive impact for selected raw materials through our involve!\nment in local development projects. During the year under report,\nfor example, we initiated a project with a locally based NGO to\nimprove living conditions associated with the mining of the raw\nmaterial mica in India.\nPurchasing battery cells\nAs of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new generation of\nbattery cells. We have therefore concluded agreements with our\npartners that guarantee annual production capacities of 40 GWh\nin Europe, 40 GWh in China and 30 GWh in the USA. Via this\nstrategy, the Company is reinforcing its \u201clocal for local\u201d approach\nby sourcing battery cells regionally where our production facilities\nare located. The BMW Group will also use secondary raw mate!\nrials to replace the primary raw materials cobalt, lithium and\nnickel in the new generation of battery cells and purchase green\nelectricity in order to further reduce the size of our carbon foot!\nprint in the supply chain. ! Carbon emissions in the supply chain\nSupply security\nTo cushion the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine on our\nEuropean plants, the BMW Group has introduced a comprehen!\nsive raft of measures with its partners and therefore continues\nto source components from western Ukraine. At the same time,\nour partners have established additional production sites outside\nUkraine and the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has\nreturned to normal as a result.\nLockdowns in China designed to contain the coronavirus pan!\ndemic kept supply chains on tenterhooks, not to mention the\nchallenging supply situation for semiconductors. In an effort to\nmitigate the worldwide shortage of semiconductors, among other\nmeasures the BMW Group has entered into supply agreements\ninvolving increased levels of buffer stock when placing orders, as\nwell as the direct purchase of strategically important semicon!\nductors.\n\nCooperation in the supplier network based on trust and the de!\nvelopment of new partnerships is essential for us when it comes\nto swiftly deploying innovations in the products on offer. In this\ncontext, we work closely with the ! BMW Startup Garage and ! BMW\ni Ventures. At Newcomer Day 2022, selected start!ups presented\na broad range of future technologies \u2013 including our new partner\nfor innovative natural fibre composite solutions.\nThe highly innovative achievements of start!ups are also reflected\nin the ! BMW Supplier Innovation Award. During the year under report,\nvarious companies won awards in the categories of e!mobility,\nsustainability, digitalisation, customer experience, exceptional\nteam performance and Newcomer of the Year, which are essen!\ntial for driving forward transformation.\n    \n    Production and Supplier Network\n112\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\n  Digitalisation in the supply chain\nA digital flow of information throughout the supply chain is a\nprerequisite for more resilient and flexible supply chain manage!\nment.\n! Catena#X is one of the largest ongoing projects in the automotive\nindustry.

Record!\ning carbon emissions data in supply chains enables measures\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions to be agreed upon and their\neffectiveness verified going forward. The BMW Group has already\nbegun preparations for the pilot tests of the initial applications.\nSocial and environmental responsibility\nThe BMW Group considers responsible supply chain manage!\nment as an integral part of good corporate governance. Against\nthe backdrop of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferket!\ntensorgfaltspflichtengesetz), the BMW Group continued to de!\nvelop its well!established processes during the year under report.\nThe BMW Group\u2019s requirements and the expectations it places\non its suppliers are set out in the ! BMW Group Supplier Code of Con#\nduct. ! GRI Index: 2#23, 3#3, 407#1, 408#1\nDue diligence in the supplier network\nA multi!stage due diligence process has been established across\nall relevant areas of the organisation to delineate our responsi!\nbility for the supplier network. A comprehensive description of\nthe due diligence process can be found ! online.\nThe BMW Group is committed to the application of standardised\nprocedures and a cooperative approach with a view to imple!\nmenting the due diligence obligations that are integrated in its\nbusiness processes and avoiding redundant activities. For this\nreason, we engage in the Sector Dialogue Automotive Industry\ninitiative, for example to develop guidelines for action and create\nan industry!wide grievance mechanism.\n\u2014 Risk analysis\nThe BMW Group monitors and assesses sustainability and\nhuman rights risks in its supplier network, including its busi!\nness relationships with both potential and active supplier\nlocations. Among other strategies, we use risk filters and\nmedia analyses to identify abstract environmental and hu!\nman rights risks, as well as standardised sustainability ques!\ntionnaires and audits to conduct specific risk analysis at our\nTier!1 suppliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for\nanalysing risks at n!Tier suppliers.\n! GRI Index: 2#24, 308#1, 414#1\n\u2014 Prevention and remediation\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW Group, suppliers are\nrequired to implement any necessary preventive or remedial\nmeasures to minimise potential risks or eliminate any deficits\nthat may have been identified \u2013 including those in the areas\nof corporate governance, human rights and working condi!\ntions, health and safety, and environmental protection \u2013 by\nan agreed target date, no later than the start of production,\nand to demand that these measures are also complied with\nby subcontractors. ! Further GRI Information, ! Sustainability\nassessment of relevant supplier sites The extent of the preventive\nmeasures is partially based on the potential risks, the nature\nand scope of the business activity and the size of the suppli!\ner. Alongside its preventive measures, the BMW Group offers\na training programme on sustainability in the supply chain\naimed at internal buyers and process partners as well as\nsuppliers. ! GRI Index: 2#24, 308#2, 414#2\n\u2014 Effectiveness and grievance mechanisms\nFor suppliers operating in high!risk regions or high!risk prod!\nuct groups, the BMW Group has implemented additional\ncontrol mechanisms, such as audits of environmental and\nsocial standards at supplier locations using its own auditors\nor external auditors. The Group reviewed a total of 49 poten!\ntial and active supplier locations via this method during the\nyear under report (2021: 38)1, 2. We have set ourselves the\ntarget of ensuring that all Tier!1 supplier sites that have been\naudited meet the locally applicable legal requirements for\nsustainability as well as international human rights standards\n(BMW Group minimum requirements). In 2022, the final au!\ndits confirmed that all cases of non!compliance with mini!\nmum requirements (non!conformities) that were identified in\ninitial audits had been redressed.\nThe internal Human Rights Contact Supply Chain unit deals\nwith any indications of possible violations of the sustainability\nrequirements stipulated by the BMW Group for the supplier\nnetwork. We also use the standardised RBA Voices grievance\nmechanism as a complementary measure. In addition,\n! whistle#blower systems to detect possible legal violations are in\nplace and compliance checks performed. Our aim is to ensure\nthat any substantiated reports of environmental or human\nrights violations are redressed by agreeing on corrective\nmeasures.\n\n Our employees continue to play a key role in ensuring that diver!\nsity, equal opportunity and inclusion are actively practised. Many\nemployees are involved in internal networks that have been set\nup, including a number of women\u2019s networks at various locations\nand the BMW Group PRIDE group, which campaigns across bor!\nders for the interests of the LGBTIQ+2 community. The dialogue\ngenerated by these internal networks creates further momentum\nfor the BMW Group\u2019s commitment to this area.\nConcepts to promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion\nhave also been developed in relation to the composition of the\nBoard of Management and Supervisory Board. Information on\nthe stipulated diversity criteria and their implementation is pro!\nvided in the ! Corporate Governance Statement.\n! GRI Index: 3#3, 405#1\nIncreasing the share of women\nThe BMW Group is working continuously to increase the share\nof women in the workforce as a whole and in management func!\ntions in particular. This remains a challenging task in that it is still\nthe case that more men go through the process of vocational\ntraining, particularly in technical fields, and are therefore in the\nmajority on the market.\nThe BMW Group has set targets for the percentage share of\nwomen at all levels of the Company. By 2025, we aim to increase\nthe share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole to\nbetween 20 and 22 % and to between 17 to 19 % for BMW AG.\nWe aim to boost the share of women holding management\npositions in the BMW Group to 22 % by 2025, and to 20 % for\nBMW AG.\nThe share of women in management functions 3 within the\nBMW Group has been rising steadily for many years. Globally,\nthe share of female managers in the BMW Group stood at 20.2 %\nat the end of the year under report (2021: 18.8 %). During the\nperiod from 2011 to 2022, the number of women in management\npositions in BMW AG has more than doubled.\nExpressed as a percentage, the share of female managers at\nBMW AG was 18.2 % at the end of 2022 (2021: 17.5 %).\nThe share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole\nreached 18.6 % (2021: 19.7 %). For BMW AG, the share was\n16.5 % (2021: 16.0 %). ! Further GRI Information\nThe BMW Group is also aware of the need to achieve a high per!\ncentage of women in our future talents programmes. By doing\nso, we aim to ensure that the share of women in the total\nworkforce and in management functions continues to rise in the\nfuture. The proportion remained high in the trainee programme\n(Global Leader Development Programme 5) in 2022 at 45 %\n(2021: 47 %). The same applied to the student support pro!\ngrammes (Fastlane, SpeedUp), with a proportion of around 31 %\n(2021: 32 %). For our vocational training in STEM subjects (sci!\nence, technology, engineering and mathematics), the share of\nwomen at BMW AG in 2022 was 16.1 % (2021: 15.6 %), and 16.4 %\n(2021: 16.1 %) in the BMW Group 6.\n1 The share of employees with severe disabilities is based on the statutory requirements in accordance\nwith the German Social Code (SGB IX).\n2 Abbreviation for all sexual orientations and forms of identity.\n3 For a definition of the term management functions, please refer to the !

Risks\nresulting from sustainability issues are generally identified via\nthe Group!wide risk management network.\nIn accordance with \u00a7 289c of the German Commercial Code\n(HGB), risks that could have an impact on the non!financial as!\npects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part\nof the reporting process. Material risks in this context are defined\nas those stemming from business activities, business relation!\nships and products and services provided by the BMW Group that\nare highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No material\nnon!financial risks were identified during the year under report.\nOpportunity management\nIdentifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s\nstrategic planning processes. The Group\u2019s range of products and\nservices is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses.\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict\ncost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels\nof profitability and return on capital employed.\nThe importance of short!term opportunities for the BMW Group\nis classified on a qualitative basis in the categories \u201cmaterial\u201d\nand \u201cimmaterial\u201d. Probable measures aimed at increasing prof!\nitability are already incorporated in the outlook.\nClimate!related opportunities are identified progressively as part\nof the ongoing strategy development process and described in\nthe section ! Climate#related risks and opportunities.\n \n Risks and Opportunities\n131\nMATERIAL SHORT,TERM\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\nThe overall risk situation for the BMW Group deteriorated signif!\nicantly as compared with the previous year.\nConsistently high inflation with lower real incomes and a corre!\nsponding widespread drop in demand may have a negative im!\npact on sales volumes and result in unfavourable price and prod!\nuct mix effects. Considerable uncertainties remain in the form of\npotential supply bottlenecks along the entire supply chain. Higher\nprices for energy, raw materials and transport may have a neg!\native impact. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, as\nwell as the progression of the coronavirus pandemic may also\nsignificantly affect the global economy. However, if the effect of\nthese issues were to prove less severe in 2023 than currently\nexpected, opportunities could arise that could benefit both rev!\nenues and earnings.\nOverall, no risks capable of threatening the continued existence\nof the BMW Group were identified either at the balance sheet\ndate or at the date on which the Group Financial Statements were\ndrawn up. The Management and the Supervisory Board do not\nsee any threat to the BMW Group\u2019s status as a going concern.\nAs in the previous year, the current set of risks to the BMW Group\nare considered to be manageable. All risks and opportunities that\nare expected to materialise have already been addressed in the\nOutlook Report.

Since January 2022, the\nhead of Group Compliance has also served as Human Rights\nOfficer of BMW AG. Further priority areas emerged in the context\nof export control, due to the war in Ukraine, and in anti!money!\nlaundering efforts, due to the increase in legislative initiatives.\nOne component of the CMS is the Data Privacy Management\nSystem (DMS), which is the responsibility of Group Data Privacy\nProtection, and also based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond mod!\nel. The data protection directive (Privacy Corporate Rules) and\nBinding Corporate Rules, which contractually protect the transfer\nof employee data within the BMW Group, form the basis of the\nDMS.

Its key objectives are to increase\ntransparency and provide an objective benchmark for capital\nmarket participants in order to channel capital flows towards\nenvironmentally sustainable economic activities.\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines eco!\nnomic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfil!\nment of predetermined technical screening criteria.\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sustain!\nable if it substantially contributes to one of the following six en!\nvironmental objectives:\nI. Climate change mitigation\nII. Climate change adaptation\nIII. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources\nIV. Transition to a circular economy\nV.

Moreover, no other environmental objective may\nbe significantly harmed as a result of performing the activity and\nthe Company involved must observe minimum safeguards,\namong them compliance with human rights.\nOn the basis of the phased introduction of the EU Taxonomy in\nthe Delegated Acts, companies such as the BMW Group were\nrequired to report the Taxonomy!eligible proportion of their rev!\nenues, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for\nEnvironmental Objectives I and II for the first time in the previous\nyear. Since reporting year 2022, the reporting requirements have\nbeen expanded to include Taxonomy!aligned proportions for\nboth these environmental objectives. The reporting scope is\nexpected to be expanded to the environmental objectives III to\nVI starting with the reporting year 2024.\nOur holistic understanding of sustainability\nThe BMW Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Taxon!\nomy to promote the private financing of environmentally sustain!\nable economic activities in order to make Europe the world\u2019s first\nclimate!neutral continent by 2050. As a company aspiring to\nachieve net zero across its entire value chain by no later than\n2050, we welcome all initiatives that serve this objective. As part\nof this commitment, the BMW Group had already set ambitious,\nscience!based targets for all three scopes in 2020, which it aims\nto achieve by 2030 (base year 2019). These goals were validated\nby the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Each year, the\nBMW Group Report informs about the level of progress. ! Strategy\nIn the coming years, the significant growth in electromobility will\nimply that the majority of carbon emissions will be generated\nwithin the upstream value chain, rather than primarily in the use\nphase. Without the anticipated set of measures to reduce carbon\nemissions generated within the BMW Group supply chain, these\nemissions would already exceed actual carbon emissions in\nthe use phase prior to 2030. ! Strategy, ! Production and Supplier\nNetwork, ! Carbon emissions Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking\na holistic approach to achieving its sustainability!related targets\nand is committed to considering carbon emissions over the\nentire life cycle of the vehicles produced. ! Carbon emissions How!\never, for the economic activities that are relevant to the\nBMW Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reducing\ncarbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable to\nlow!emissions (until 2025) and emissions!free drive systems.\nIndirect carbon emissions, for instance those produced when\ngenerating charging current or during the energy!intensive pro!\nduction of high!voltage batteries, are not taken into account in\nthe context of these economic activities. Moreover, the EU Tax!\nonomy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures in\nin!house production to the extent that they serve to manufacture\nTaxonomy!aligned products or to the extent that they are explic!\nitly included in the description of an activity. The deficit of this\napproach is shown by the example that increasing the energy\nefficiency of paint shop processes also reduces carbon emissions\nin in!house production when a conventionally powered vehicle\nis painted.

As\nno data are available regarding the relevant attributes of these\nthird!party products, it is not currently possible to make a com!\nprehensive assessment in relation to the DNSH criteria. For this\nreason, these vehicles are not currently reported as Taxonomy!\naligned.\nClimate change adaptation\nA robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for\nboth economic activity 3.3 and economic activity 6.5 to determine\nthat they do not cause significant harm to Environmental Objec!\ntive II. It considers the physical climate risks at all key BMW Group\nproduction sites as well as any potential damage that may occur\nas a result of climate change based on long!term climate projec!\ntion scenarios*up to 2034 and 2050. Moreover, we consider po!\ntential natural hazards at all of our direct supplier locations in\norder to adequately take supply risks into account when se!\nlecting and evaluating suppliers. Adaptive solutions to mitigate\nrisks are drawn up and implemented as appropriate based on   EU Taxonomy\n79\nEU TAXONOMY\nWithin the framework of the implementation of the European\nGreen Deal and the Action Plan \u201cFinancing Sustainable Growth\u201d,\nthe EU Taxonomy is a cornerstone of the EU\u2019s aspiration to be!\ncome climate!neutral by 2050. Its key objectives are to increase\ntransparency and provide an objective benchmark for capital\nmarket participants in order to channel capital flows towards\nenvironmentally sustainable economic activities.\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines eco!\nnomic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfil!\nment of predetermined technical screening criteria.\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sustain!\nable if it substantially contributes to one of the following six en!\nvironmental objectives:\nI. Climate change mitigation\nII. Climate change adaptation\nIII. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources\nIV. Transition to a circular economy\nV. Pollution prevention and control\nVI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and\necosystems\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nThis contribution is based on fulfilment of specific predetermined\nrequirements. Moreover, no other environmental objective may\nbe significantly harmed as a result of performing the activity and\nthe Company involved must observe minimum safeguards,\namong them compliance with human rights.\nOn the basis of the phased introduction of the EU Taxonomy in\nthe Delegated Acts, companies such as the BMW Group were\nrequired to report the Taxonomy!eligible proportion of their rev!\nenues, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for\nEnvironmental Objectives I and II for the first time in the previous\nyear. Since reporting year 2022, the reporting requirements have\nbeen expanded to include Taxonomy!aligned proportions for\nboth these environmental objectives. The reporting scope is\nexpected to be expanded to the environmental objectives III to\nVI starting with the reporting year 2024.\nOur holistic understanding of sustainability\nThe BMW Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Taxon!\nomy to promote the private financing of environmentally sustain!\nable economic activities in order to make Europe the world\u2019s first\nclimate!neutral continent by 2050. As a company aspiring to\nachieve net zero across its entire value chain by no later than\n2050, we welcome all initiatives that serve this objective. As part\nof this commitment, the BMW Group had already set ambitious,\nscience!based targets for all three scopes in 2020, which it aims\nto achieve by 2030 (base year 2019). These goals were validated\nby the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Each year, the\nBMW Group Report informs about the level of progress. ! Strategy\nIn the coming years, the significant growth in electromobility will\nimply that the majority of carbon emissions will be generated\nwithin the upstream value chain, rather than primarily in the use\nphase. Without the anticipated set of measures to reduce carbon\nemissions generated within the BMW Group supply chain, these\nemissions would already exceed actual carbon emissions in\nthe use phase prior to 2030. ! Strategy, ! Production and Supplier\nNetwork, ! Carbon emissions Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking\na holistic approach to achieving its sustainability!related targets\nand is committed to considering carbon emissions over the\nentire life cycle of the vehicles produced. ! Carbon emissions How!\never, for the economic activities that are relevant to the\nBMW Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reducing\ncarbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable to\nlow!emissions (until 2025) and emissions!free drive systems.\nIndirect carbon emissions, for instance those produced when\ngenerating charging current or during the energy!intensive pro!\nduction of high!voltage batteries, are not taken into account in\nthe context of these economic activities. Moreover, the EU Tax!\nonomy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures in\nin!house production to the extent that they serve to manufacture\nTaxonomy!aligned products or to the extent that they are explic!\nitly included in the description of an activity. The deficit of this\napproach is shown by the example that increasing the energy\nefficiency of paint shop processes also reduces carbon emissions\nin in!house production when a conventionally powered vehicle\nis painted. In light of the BMW Group\u2019s selected economic activ!\nities, its sustainability efforts in this regard are not, or are only\npartially, taken into account in the EU Taxonomy.\n      \n EU Taxonomy\n80\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report\nOther Information\n   Explanatory comments on reporting procedures\nExplanatory comments on reporting procedures for the reporting\nyear 2022, we are reporting on Taxonomy alignment for the first\ntime in relation to Environmental Objective I \u201cClimate change\nmitigation\u201d and Environmental Objective II \u201cClimate change\nadaptation\u201d, in addition to reporting on Taxonomy eligibility.\nTaxonomy eligibility is an initial indicator of the maximum envi!\nronmental sustainability potential of economic activities as\ndefined by the EU Taxonomy. Taxonomy alignment, on the other\nhand, serves as an indicator of an organisation\u2019s transformation\ntowards environmentally sustainable economic activities.\nAn economic activity is to be seen as Taxonomy!eligible if it is\ndescribed in the Delegated Acts relating to one of the six envi!\nronmental objectives, regardless of whether that economic\nactivity meets the technical screening criteria stipulated in those\nDelegated Acts. Following an analysis, the BMW Group\u2019s business\nactivities can best be summarised under the following economic\nactivities1:\n\u2014 Economic activity 3.3 \u201cManufacture of low carbon technolo!\ngies for transport\u201d including the production of passenger cars\nand motorcycles.\n\u2014 Economic activity 6.5 \u201cTransport by motorbikes, passenger\ncars and light commercial vehicles\u201d including the acquisition,\nfinancing, lease and operation of automobiles and motor!\ncycles.\nBased on the descriptions of the two economic activities listed\nfor Environmental Objective I \u201cClimate change mitigation\u201d and\nin consideration of the additional clarification by the EU Com!\nmission regarding the Taxonomy eligibility of vehicles with\ncombustion engines under economic activity 3.3, a large part of\nthe BMW Group\u2019s business model falls within the scope of the\nEU Taxonomy Annex . 2\nOnly the sale of parts and components, such as after!sales busi!\nness excluding the provision of repair services, the supply of\ncomponents for production to BMW Brilliance up to and including\nExplanatory comments on reporting procedures\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\n              Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equip!\nment of the BMW Group were more than 19 % Taxonomy!\naligned. This proportion more than doubles to 43 % in relation\nto additions recorded by the Automotive and Motorcycle seg!\nments. The latter highlights the high proportion of Taxonomy!\naligned capital expenditure of the Automotive segment.\nThe growing share of zero!emissions vehicles, the development\nand production methods used, and \u2013 where applicable \u2013 contri!\nbutions made to other environmental objectives as yet to be\ndefined are expected to lead to an increase in Taxonomy!aligned\nrevenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure. Due to\nthe high level of investment in the transformation of our business\nactivities, for example in the electrification of our vehicles and\nresearch into alternative drivetrains, these economic activities\nhave the potential to become Taxonomy!aligned over time. Over!\nall, we anticipate that the proportion of Taxonomy!aligned eco!\nnomic activities will steadily rise as a result of the increasing\nelectrification of our product portfolio. ! Strategy\nThe contribution of the two economic activities considered for\nEnvironmental Objective II is subsumed in the contribution re!\nported for Environmental Objective I. Regardless of the taxonomy\ncriteria, the BMW Group regularly and comprehensively addresses\nrisks arising from climate change and their potential impact on its\nlocations and supply chains.\n! DNSH adaptation to climate change, ! TCFD climate risks\nAs the overview tables from Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178\ndo not provide a detailed picture of the BMW Group\u2019s business\nmodel per economic activity, the following table provides detailed\ninformation about the three performance indicators for both eco!\n\u2014 Economic activity 6.5, \u201cTransport by motorbikes, passenger\ncars and light commercial vehicles\u201d\nThe Taxonomy!aligned shares for the three performance\nindicators were at a low single!digit level for the Financial\nServices segment. This was due to the fact that \u2013 compared\nto the Automotive segment \u2013 there is a time lag before the\neffects of the vehicle fleet electrification ramp!up are felt in\nthe financing and leasing lines of business. A further reason\nis the stricter DNSH requirements for economic activity 6.5,\nin particular those relating to environmental objective V\n\u201cPollution prevention and control\u201d, which lead to the exclu!\nsion of all PHEV and a significant restriction in the recognition\nof BEV in the scope of EU Taxonomy reporting (for details see\nSection \u201cAvoidance of significant harm\u201d). In addition, with\neconomic activity 6.5, third!party brands can only be included\nin the vehicle portfolio under restrictive conditions, such as\nfor the purpose of assigning tyre categories or WLTP\nemissions values as part of the process of testing compliance\nwith the DNSH criteria. As a result, no specific deductions\ncan be allocated, with the consequence that the models con!\ncerned must be excluded from the scope of reporting on Tax!\nonomy alignment.\nnomic activities.\n\n\nSupply chains and supplier network\nThe year 2022 was dominated by fragile supply chains and rising\nprices for many materials. The cost drivers for the BMW Group\u2019s\nPurchasing team were primarily the price hikes seen for raw ma!\nterials, semiconductors, energy and transportation coupled with\na challenging supply situation. The combined impact of supply\nbottlenecks for semiconductor components, the temporarily\nrestricted availability of wire harnesses owing to the war in\nUkraine, and pandemic!related lockdowns in China led to pro!\nduction interruptions worldwide, particularly in the first half of the\nyear. Although the situation eased slightly during the second six!\nmonth period, global supply chains remained in a fragile state.\n! Outlook, ! Risks and opportunities\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com!\nponents close to its production sites to the extent possible and\nis therefore represented by local teams in all its key purchasing\nmarkets, in order to identify risks promptly and respond flexibly\nto the respective market circumstances. In the face of geostra!\ntegic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group\u2019s supply chains\nis also becoming increasingly important and the BMW Group\ntakes this fact into account when selecting its partners.\nIn!house production: a competitive advantage\nThe BMW Group regularly examines its range of products in\nterms of their profitability and strategic importance. A special\nfocus is currently on e!mobility. In this central area of transfor!\nmation, the BMW Group is building up its own skill sets in stra!\ntegically important components, particularly in areas where tech!\nnology is not competitively available on the market. The in!house\nproduction of certain key components also helps us to improve\nthe level of supply security and thus gain a competitive advan!\ntage. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen our pro!\ncess!related expertise in technologies relevant for quality man!\nagement within the supplier network.\nQuality assurance\nQuality is a vital competitive factor and of key importance for\nensuring customer satisfaction. Our quality experts monitor the\nentire product development process, including the phases of in!\ndustrialisation and series production. Regular visits to suppliers\nand a preventive, systematic review of all processes are aimed\nat ensuring the agreed quality.\n\n  The volatile situation on energy and raw materials markets had\na major impact on purchasing over the course of 2022. There are\nsigns of increasing competition for the raw materials required to\ndrive forward electric mobility. With the help of measures such\nas the direct purchase of lithium and cobalt, the BMW Group is\nmaking itself technologically and regionally less dependent on\nindividual deposits and suppliers. Direct purchasing in Australia,\nArgentina and Morocco underpin our dual intention of securing\nraw material supplies, whilst also maintaining our high sustain!\nability standards, particularly in supply chains involving critical\nraw materials. At the same time, the BMW Group analyses the\ndevelopment of raw materials prices and hedges against price\nfluctuations \u2013 provided the capital market offers the opportunity\nto do so. ! Raw materials price risks and opportunities\n* Direct and indirect purchasing;\nthis includes the entire year 2022 for BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n   \n   Production and Supplier Network\n 111\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nOur commitment to upholding environmental and social\nstandards as well as human rights in our raw materials supply\nchains is enshrined in the ! BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct and\nthe ! High#level commitment to sustainable natural rubber among\nothers. The BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct also requires\nTier!1 suppliers to demand minimum standards within their\nsub!supplier chains.\nAnnual risk analyses regarding the BMW Group\u2019s sustainability\nstandards are the starting point for raw materials!related hedg!\ning activities that are designed to reduce environmental and\nhuman rights risks. Key levers in this respect are to forgo, sub!\nstitute or reduce the use of primary risk raw materials. We also\nfocus in particular on cooperating closely with our partners in the\nsupplier network as well as in multi!stakeholder initiatives and\nprojects. We use scientific findings to gain an even better under!\nstanding of the raw material extraction process and to take it into\naccount accordingly when analysing the level of risk in order to\nfurther reduce any negative impacts.\nThe BMW Group places a particular focus on so!called \u201cconflict\nminerals\u201d and uses standardised Responsible Minerals Initiative\n(RMI) tools to ensure that the raw materials deployed can be\ntraced back to the smelter. It uses existing certifications to ensure\nthe origin of other raw materials. The BMW Group is also involved\nin developing certified standards for critical stages of the value\nchain, for example as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining\nAssurance (IRMA), and subsequently applies them. Further de!\ntails and raw materials profiles are available ! online. ! SASB Index\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a\npositive impact for selected raw materials through our involve!\nment in local development projects. During the year under report,\nfor example, we initiated a project with a locally based NGO to\nimprove living conditions associated with the mining of the raw\nmaterial mica in India.\nPurchasing battery cells\nAs of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new generation of\nbattery cells. We have therefore concluded agreements with our\npartners that guarantee annual production capacities of 40 GWh\nin Europe, 40 GWh in China and 30 GWh in the USA. Via this\nstrategy, the Company is reinforcing its \u201clocal for local\u201d approach\nby sourcing battery cells regionally where our production facilities\nare located. The BMW Group will also use secondary raw mate!\nrials to replace the primary raw materials cobalt, lithium and\nnickel in the new generation of battery cells and purchase green\nelectricity in order to further reduce the size of our carbon foot!\nprint in the supply chain. ! Carbon emissions in the supply chain\nSupply security\nTo cushion the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine on our\nEuropean plants, the BMW Group has introduced a comprehen!\nsive raft of measures with its partners and therefore continues\nto source components from western Ukraine. At the same time,\nour partners have established additional production sites outside\nUkraine and the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has\nreturned to normal as a result.\nLockdowns in China designed to contain the coronavirus pan!\ndemic kept supply chains on tenterhooks, not to mention the\nchallenging supply situation for semiconductors. In an effort to\nmitigate the worldwide shortage of semiconductors, among other\nmeasures the BMW Group has entered into supply agreements\ninvolving increased levels of buffer stock when placing orders, as\nwell as the direct purchase of strategically important semicon!\nductors.\n\nCooperation in the supplier network based on trust and the de!\nvelopment of new partnerships is essential for us when it comes\nto swiftly deploying innovations in the products on offer. In this\ncontext, we work closely with the ! BMW Startup Garage and ! BMW\ni Ventures. At Newcomer Day 2022, selected start!ups presented\na broad range of future technologies \u2013 including our new partner\nfor innovative natural fibre composite solutions.\nThe highly innovative achievements of start!ups are also reflected\nin the ! BMW Supplier Innovation Award. During the year under report,\nvarious companies won awards in the categories of e!mobility,\nsustainability, digitalisation, customer experience, exceptional\nteam performance and Newcomer of the Year, which are essen!\ntial for driving forward transformation.\n    \n    Production and Supplier Network\n112\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\n  Digitalisation in the supply chain\nA digital flow of information throughout the supply chain is a\nprerequisite for more resilient and flexible supply chain manage!\nment.\n! Catena#X is one of the largest ongoing projects in the automotive\nindustry. It is open to all BMW Group partners and designed to\nenable data exchange across the various levels of the value chain\nbetween automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. With the\nplatform due to be launched in 2023, Catena!X is expected to\noffer an end!to!end solution that will lead to closer and even\nmore coordinated cooperation between partners. One of our aims\nis to improve transparency and response speed by regularly com!\nparing the demand and capacity situation in order to adjust the\nsupply of parts at short notice. Further improvements are expect!\ned for the network partners, whether raw materials suppliers,\nn!Tier suppliers or automotive manufacturers, for example in\nterms of delivery reliability and customer satisfaction. At the\nsame time, costs can be effectively cut by improving capacity\nutilisation and avoiding special procurement processes. Record!\ning carbon emissions data in supply chains enables measures\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions to be agreed upon and their\neffectiveness verified going forward. The BMW Group has already\nbegun preparations for the pilot tests of the initial applications.\nSocial and environmental responsibility\nThe BMW Group considers responsible supply chain manage!\nment as an integral part of good corporate governance. Against\nthe backdrop of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferket!\ntensorgfaltspflichtengesetz), the BMW Group continued to de!\nvelop its well!established processes during the year under report.\nThe BMW Group\u2019s requirements and the expectations it places\non its suppliers are set out in the !

GRI Index: 2#23, 3#3, 407#1, 408#1\nDue diligence in the supplier network\nA multi!stage due diligence process has been established across\nall relevant areas of the organisation to delineate our responsi!\nbility for the supplier network. A comprehensive description of\nthe due diligence process can be found ! online.\nThe BMW Group is committed to the application of standardised\nprocedures and a cooperative approach with a view to imple!\nmenting the due diligence obligations that are integrated in its\nbusiness processes and avoiding redundant activities. For this\nreason, we engage in the Sector Dialogue Automotive Industry\ninitiative, for example to develop guidelines for action and create\nan industry!wide grievance mechanism.\n\u2014 Risk analysis\nThe BMW Group monitors and assesses sustainability and\nhuman rights risks in its supplier network, including its busi!\nness relationships with both potential and active supplier\nlocations. Among other strategies, we use risk filters and\nmedia analyses to identify abstract environmental and hu!\nman rights risks, as well as standardised sustainability ques!\ntionnaires and audits to conduct specific risk analysis at our\nTier!1 suppliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for\nanalysing risks at n!Tier suppliers.\n! GRI Index: 2#24, 308#1, 414#1\n\u2014 Prevention and remediation\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW Group, suppliers are\nrequired to implement any necessary preventive or remedial\nmeasures to minimise potential risks or eliminate any deficits\nthat may have been identified \u2013 including those in the areas\nof corporate governance, human rights and working condi!\ntions, health and safety, and environmental protection \u2013 by\nan agreed target date, no later than the start of production,\nand to demand that these measures are also complied with\nby subcontractors. ! Further GRI Information, ! Sustainability\nassessment of relevant supplier sites The extent of the preventive\nmeasures is partially based on the potential risks, the nature\nand scope of the business activity and the size of the suppli!\ner. Alongside its preventive measures, the BMW Group offers\na training programme on sustainability in the supply chain\naimed at internal buyers and process partners as well as\nsuppliers. ! GRI Index: 2#24, 308#2, 414#2\n\u2014 Effectiveness and grievance mechanisms\nFor suppliers operating in high!risk regions or high!risk prod!\nuct groups, the BMW Group has implemented additional\ncontrol mechanisms, such as audits of environmental and\nsocial standards at supplier locations using its own auditors\nor external auditors. The Group reviewed a total of 49 poten!\ntial and active supplier locations via this method during the\nyear under report (2021: 38)1, 2. We have set ourselves the\ntarget of ensuring that all Tier!1 supplier sites that have been\naudited meet the locally applicable legal requirements for\nsustainability as well as international human rights standards\n(BMW Group minimum requirements). In 2022, the final au!\ndits confirmed that all cases of non!compliance with mini!\nmum requirements (non!conformities) that were identified in\ninitial audits had been redressed.\nThe internal Human Rights Contact Supply Chain unit deals\nwith any indications of possible violations of the sustainability\nrequirements stipulated by the BMW Group for the supplier\nnetwork. We also use the standardised RBA Voices grievance\nmechanism as a complementary measure. In addition,\n! whistle#blower systems to detect possible legal violations are in\nplace and compliance checks performed. Our aim is to ensure\nthat any substantiated reports of environmental or human\nrights violations are redressed by agreeing on corrective\nmeasures.\n\n Our employees continue to play a key role in ensuring that diver!\nsity, equal opportunity and inclusion are actively practised. Many\nemployees are involved in internal networks that have been set\nup, including a number of women\u2019s networks at various locations\nand the BMW Group PRIDE group, which campaigns across bor!\nders for the interests of the LGBTIQ+2 community. The dialogue\ngenerated by these internal networks creates further momentum\nfor the BMW Group\u2019s commitment to this area.\nConcepts to promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion\nhave also been developed in relation to the composition of the\nBoard of Management and Supervisory Board. Information on\nthe stipulated diversity criteria and their implementation is pro!\nvided in the ! Corporate Governance Statement.\n! GRI Index: 3#3, 405#1\nIncreasing the share of women\nThe BMW Group is working continuously to increase the share\nof women in the workforce as a whole and in management func!\ntions in particular. This remains a challenging task in that it is still\nthe case that more men go through the process of vocational\ntraining, particularly in technical fields, and are therefore in the\nmajority on the market.\nThe BMW Group has set targets for the percentage share of\nwomen at all levels of the Company. By 2025, we aim to increase\nthe share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole to\nbetween 20 and 22 % and to between 17 to 19 % for BMW AG.\nWe aim to boost the share of women holding management\npositions in the BMW Group to 22 % by 2025, and to 20 % for\nBMW AG.\nThe share of women in management functions 3 within the\nBMW Group has been rising steadily for many years. Globally,\nthe share of female managers in the BMW Group stood at 20.2 %\nat the end of the year under report (2021: 18.8 %). During the\nperiod from 2011 to 2022, the number of women in management\npositions in BMW AG has more than doubled.\nExpressed as a percentage, the share of female managers at\nBMW AG was 18.2 % at the end of 2022 (2021: 17.5 %).\nThe share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole\nreached 18.6 % (2021: 19.7 %).

Material risks in this context are defined\nas those stemming from business activities, business relation!\nships and products and services provided by the BMW Group that\nare highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No material\nnon!financial risks were identified during the year under report.\nOpportunity management\nIdentifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s\nstrategic planning processes. The Group\u2019s range of products and\nservices is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses.\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict\ncost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels\nof profitability and return on capital employed.\nThe importance of short!term opportunities for the BMW Group\nis classified on a qualitative basis in the categories \u201cmaterial\u201d\nand \u201cimmaterial\u201d. Probable measures aimed at increasing prof!\nitability are already incorporated in the outlook.\nClimate!related opportunities are identified progressively as part\nof the ongoing strategy development process and described in\nthe section ! Climate#related risks and opportunities.\n \n Risks and Opportunities\n131\nMATERIAL SHORT,TERM\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\nThe overall risk situation for the BMW Group deteriorated signif!\nicantly as compared with the previous year.\nConsistently high inflation with lower real incomes and a corre!\nsponding widespread drop in demand may have a negative im!\npact on sales volumes and result in unfavourable price and prod!\nuct mix effects. Considerable uncertainties remain in the form of\npotential supply bottlenecks along the entire supply chain. Higher\nprices for energy, raw materials and transport may have a neg!\native impact. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, as\nwell as the progression of the coronavirus pandemic may also\nsignificantly affect the global economy. However, if the effect of\nthese issues were to prove less severe in 2023 than currently\nexpected, opportunities could arise that could benefit both rev!\nenues and earnings.\nOverall, no risks capable of threatening the continued existence\nof the BMW Group were identified either at the balance sheet\ndate or at the date on which the Group Financial Statements were\ndrawn up. The Management and the Supervisory Board do not\nsee any threat to the BMW Group\u2019s status as a going concern.\nAs in the previous year, the current set of risks to the BMW Group\nare considered to be manageable. All risks and opportunities that\nare expected to materialise have already been addressed in the\nOutlook Report. Liquidity requirements are currently covered by\nexisting liquidity as well as the various financing instruments\navailable.\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report\nOther Information\n                 The following sections illustrate potential future developments\nor events that could result in a negative (risk) or a positive (op!\nportunity) deviation from the outlook for 2023 and 2024 and\nindicate their significance to the BMW Group.\nIn addition, unforeseen events could affect business operations\nand hence the BMW Group\u2019s results of operations, financial\nposition and net assets as well as its reputation.\nThe following overview provides a summary of the material short!\nterm risks and opportunities:\nMacroeconomic risks and opportunities\nStrategic and sector!specific risks and opportunities\n\nCOMPLIANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report Remuneration Report Other Information\n Compliance lays the foundation for the long!term success of the\nBMW Group, builds trust in our products and brands, and shapes\nour public image. Compliance is not just a matter of adhering to\napplicable laws and Company rules around the world. It forms\npart of our identity, our understanding of leadership and our living\nculture of integrity. Compliance creates a binding framework for\nall our business activities.\nCompliance as a corporate function\nCompliance is the managerial responsibility of the Board of Man!\nagement of BMW AG, executed by creating an appropriate reg!\nulatory and supervisory framework, as well as through regular\nand ad hoc reporting, accompanied by clear communications.\nThis approach is based on the core belief that compliance with\napplicable laws and related internal regulations is the responsi!\nbility of all employees. As role models, managers are tasked with\nanchoring compliance culture in their area of responsibility and\nensuring compliance requirements and processes are imple!\nmented accordingly. ! GRI Index: 2#23\nIn addition to being responsible for the Company!wide Compli!\nance Management System, the Chief Compliance Officer also\nmanages the Group Compliance division and briefs the Board of\nManagement and Supervisory Board of BMW AG at regular in!\ntervals.\nCompliance Management System (CMS)\nThe BMW Group\u2019s Company!wide Compliance Management\nSystem (CMS) reinforces the culture of compliance and integrity\nand helps reduce sanction and liability risks, as well as risks aris!\ning from other (non!)financial disadvantages, such as reputa!\ntional risks. The CMS focuses on adequacy and effectiveness and\nis based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond model, which defines\nspecific preventive, monitoring, control and response measures.\nClear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also essential.\nThe CMS is tailored to the Company\u2019s risk situation and address!\nes all relevant compliance topics. Company!wide, these include\ncorruption and fraud prevention, anti!money!laundering, antitrust\nand human rights compliance, export control, data privacy and\nproduct compliance. Responsibility for data privacy and product\ncompliance lies with separate specialist departments outside\nGroup Compliance. ! GRI Index: 2#27, 205#1, 205#3, 206#1\nFurther development of CMS\nThe CMS is reviewed on a regular basis and refined as needed.\nThe main drivers are strategic focus topics, legal and regulatory\nrequirements and trends, best practices and industry standards,\nall of which are taken into account from a risk perspective. The\nobjective is to consistently improve the CMS. The BMW Group is\nan active member of various associations and interest groups,\nincluding the German Institute for Compliance (DICO) at Board\nlevel and through its leadership of the working group on human\nrights.\n\n144\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\nOne focus of work in the field of compliance during the reporting\nperiod was on amending the human rights compliance pro!\ngramme in response to the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\nwhich took effect on 1 January 2023. Since January 2022, the\nhead of Group Compliance has also served as Human Rights\nOfficer of BMW AG. Further priority areas emerged in the context\nof export control, due to the war in Ukraine, and in anti!money!\nlaundering efforts, due to the increase in legislative initiatives.\nOne component of the CMS is the Data Privacy Management\nSystem (DMS), which is the responsibility of Group Data Privacy\nProtection, and also based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond mod!\nel. The data protection directive (Privacy Corporate Rules) and\nBinding Corporate Rules, which contractually protect the transfer\nof employee data within the BMW Group, form the basis of the\nDMS. Implementation of the DMS is validated through regular\nreporting by affiliated companies and independent audits carried\nout by Group Data Privacy Protection.\nAs part of the CMS, responsibility for product compliance, with a\nfocus on compliance with technical requirements for BMW Group\nproducts, lies with the Quality Management division. The pro!\ngramme was further developed during the reporting year as\npart of a broad!based project, with a primary focus on integrating\nthe governance function more closely into operating processes\nand expanding training and communications activities. Prod!\nuct!specific risk assessments ensure holistic risk monitoring.\n   Compliance and Human Rights\n145\nBMW Group Report 2022 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor\u2019s Report\nRemuneration Report Other Information\n Company!wide compliance network\nRelevant compliance risks are identified in the business depart!\nments on the basis of internal guidelines; an initial assessment\nis then made and measures taken to mitigate them. More than\n250 managers group!wide perform these tasks for their area of\nresponsibility as operational Compliance Responsibles.\nSpecialist departments worldwide are supported in their work\nby the central Group Compliance function, as well as the network\nof business unit and division Compliance Officers (heads of rel!\nevant compliance functions), supplemented by around 80 local\nCompliance Officers (heads of local compliance functions) at\nBMW AG\u2019s international subsidiaries. Every Compliance Officer\nis tasked with implementing the CMS and compliance pro!\ngrammes for defined topics in their area of activity, as well as\nidentifying and realising division!specific compliance measures.\nExpanded training activities\nTraining opportunities are continuously refined for specific target\ngroups. For example, during the year under review, we expanded\nour mandatory Company!wide Compliance Essentials online\ntraining to six languages.\nOnline and classroom training with case studies and test ques!\ntions, repeated every two years, strengthens the compliance\nculture and reinforces compliant behaviour. More than 81,000\nstaff and managers worldwide have so far completed the Com!\npliance Essentials training and 38,000 have received antitrust\ncompliance training.* This offering is supplemented by manda!\ntory data privacy training, which is available in 13 languages\nworldwide, and training courses on ! human rights.\n! GRI Index: 205#2\nDigitalisation supports compliance\nIT!based compliance systems have been used for transparent\nand efficient documentation, assessment and approval of com!\npliance!relevant matters Company!wide for years. This includes\ntopics such as money laundering and sanctions lists, exchange\nactivities with competitors, business partner due diligence\nand verifying the legal admissibility of benefits in kind. The data\ncollected in this way forms the basis for the compliance risk\nassessment.\nCompliance and notification systems\nEmployees with questions or concerns relating to compliance\ncan discuss these matters with their managers or relevant\ndepartments and, specifically, with the compliance functions.\nReports may also be submitted anonymously and confidentially\nin several languages via the BMW Group SpeakUP Line notifica!\ntion system or via the ombudsperson. !

We closely supervised , carefu lly monitored and advised the Executive Board in the management of the company . We were directly involved in a timely manner in all decisions of fun- damental importance to the company . The Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular , timely and comprehensive updates at its meetings as well as ver- bally and in writing on all issues of relevance to the company . In particular , these include the business performance , business strat- egy , planning , significant business transactions in the company an d the Continental Group , and the related risks and opportunities , as well as compliance issues . The members of the Supervisory Board were also available to the Executive Board for consultation outside the meetings . As chairman of the Supervisory Board , I h ad regular contact with the members of the Executive Board , in particular with its chairman , and discussed current company issues and develop- ments with them . Pursuant to a suggestion of the German Corpo- rate Governance Code , I also held discussions with inv estors in 2022 on topics specific to the Supervisory Board . Meetings of the Supervisory Board and the committees Meetings of the Supervisory Board took place both virtually and in person in fiscal 2022 . In total , the Supervisory Board convened for five ordinary meetings and one extraordinary meeting in 2022 , as well as for the strategy meeting . The September and December meetings and the strategy meeting were held in person , while the other meetings took place virtually . At its meetings , the Supervisory Board regularly conferred part of the time in the absence of the Executive Board . In addition to these meetings , the Supervisory Board passed two resolutions by written procedure , one of which was passed only by the shareholder representatives . The Chairman \u2019 s Committee held two meetings in the reporting year ( one virtually and one in person ) and passed two resolutions by written procedure . The Audit Committee met four times virtually in 2022 and passed one resolution by written procedure . The Nomi- nation Comm ittee passed one resolution by written procedure and also prepared the appointment of a new member to the Supervisory Board and the revision of its profile of skills and expertise . The Me- diation Committee in accordance with Section 27 ( 3 ) of the German Co-determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz \u2013 MitbestG ) was not required to meet in 2022 , and neither was the Committee for Re- lated Party Transactions ( RPT Committee ) .

Schaeffler 1 / 2 50 Key topics dealt with by the Supervisory Board and the Chairman \u2019 s Committee At each ordinary meeting of the plenary session , the Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board in detail of the sales , results and employment development in the Continental Gr oup and indi- vidual group sectors as well as the financial situation of the com- pany . Where the actual course of business deviated from the de- fined plans and targets , the Executive Board provided detailed expla- nations . It discussed the reasons for these devi ations and the measures introduced in depth with the Supervisory Board . In addi- tion , the Executive Board regularly informed us about the Continen- tal Group \u2019 s main raw materials and sales markets and about Conti- nental AG \u2019 s share price performance . As part of this regular report- ing , the Executive Board also went into detail on the impact of the war in Ukraine on the company . In addition , the work of the Supervisory Board and its collaboration with the Executive Board in the year under review continued to be shaped by the transformation process in the automotive industry and its consequences for the company . Another focus of the Super- visory Board \u2019 s work was again on the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investiga- tion into the manipulation of emission limits in vehicles of spe cific automotive manufacturers , including monitoring of the correspond- ing investigative proceedings by public prosecutors . The Supervisory Board discussed this at each ordinary meeting . The Special Emis- sions Committee formed in connection with this matter also met twice in 2022 . Finally , the Supervisory Board addressed cybersecu- rity and the cyberattack on Continental in detail , as well as the irreg- ularities in the production of air conditioning lines and indus trial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector . At the meeting on March 17 , 2022 , we discussed and subse- quently approved the company \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2021 . We also approved both the decision by the Executive Board to hold the 2022 Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting virtually and the draft agenda for the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting , and resolved the proposed resolutions of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . In addition , we discussed the acquisition of US conveyor belt manufacturer WCCO Belting , LLC , Wilmington , Delaware , USA , by the ContiTech group sector and the sale of a product line from the Automotive group sector . Measures from the Supervisory Board \u2019 s self-assessment in 2021 were also discussed at the meeting , and we resolved to implement the proposed improvement measures . These include , for example , establishing a further regular plenary meeting per fiscal year . We also passed a resolution on the approval in principle of the reassignment of 24.9 % of the shares in ContiTech AG , Hanover , from Continental Pension Trust e. V. , Hanover , to the Continental Group . Final approval on this reassignment was resolved by written procedure at the end of May on the recomme ndation of the Audit Committee . In addition , we resolved to update the declaration in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktien - gesetz \u2013 AktG ) on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code , since the circums tances that required a change to the declaration in connection with the spin -off of Vitesco Tech- nologies Group AG in September 2021 no longer appl ied . At the Supervisory Board meeting on April 29 , 2022 , in addition to the ongoing business development , we also discussed in depth the Continental Group \u2019 s business activities in Russia , particularly with respect to the Tires group sector . We also received reports from the Executive Board on how the company is responding to supply shortages and price increases in the supply of energy . In implementing concrete measures following the Supervisory Board \u2019 s self -assessment , an additional ordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board was held for the first time on June 23 , 2022 . The transformation process in the automotive industry was an important topic of discussion at this meeting . In addition , the head of Compliance reported on the future organizational structure for compliance , and the Executive Board provided an update on the Continental Group \u2019 s current insurance sit uation . At the full -day strategy meeting held on September 21 , 2022 , the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board once again dis- cussed in detail the strategic objectives and strategic planning of the Continental Group , the Automotive group sector ( with a focus on the Autonomous Mobility business area ) and the Tires and Con ti- Tech group sectors , the Continental Group \u2019 s sustainability require- ments and the HR strategy . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 13 action . The Supervisory Board also resolved that a further special committee ( the Special ContiTech Committee ) would support this investigation . The Chairman \u2019 s Committee held two meetings in the year under review , in which it primarily prepared the personnel -related decisions of the plenary session and mad e recommendations for resolutions . At the first meeting on March 17 , 2022 , this included the recom- mendation on determined performance bonuses for fiscal 2021 , which the plenary session resolved at its following meeting . At the second meeting on December 14 , 2022 , the Chairman \u2019 s Commit- tee resolved proposals to the Chairman \u2019 s Committee relating to tar- gets set for the variable remuneration of the Executive Board and to the creation of a new Executive Board function for Integrity and Law . At the end of May , the Chairman \u2019 s Committee also approved the acquisition of US conveyor belt manufacturer WCCO Belting , LLC , Wilmington , Delaware , USA , by written procedure . This acquisi- tion had previously been discussed at the meeting of the plenary session on March 17 , 2022 . In September , the Chairman \u2019 s Commit- tee approved an investment project of the Automotive group sector by written procedure . Key topics dealt with by the Audit Committee The Audit Committee was also informed by the Executive Board in detail and on an ongoi ng basis about sales , results and employment development in the Continental Group and individual group sectors as well as the financial situation of the company . The Executive Board is assisted by the head of Accounting and the head of Group Controlling , w ho attend the meetings of the Audit Committee and can thereby provide information directly . In addition , the chairman of the Audit Committee is in regular contact with the chief financial officer and the auditor of the Continental Group outside of meetings and has access to senior employees entrusted with tasks relating to accounting , the internal control system , the risk management sys- tem , internal auditing and compliance . The chairman of the Audit Committee shares key information with the Audit Committee . As a focus of each of its quarterly meetings , the Audit Committee talks with the Executive Board about the accounting as at the end of the previous quarter and the outlook for the year as a whole as well as the quarterly statements and the half -year fina ncial report prior to their publication . Another focus of the Audit Committee \u2019 s work in the past fiscal year was dealing with the company \u2019 s internal control system and risk management system . At its meeting on March 2 , 2022 , the Audit Committee discussed the company \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the combined non -financial state- ment for 2021 with the Executive Board and the auditor , and rec- ommended their approval to the pl enary session of the Supervisory Board . The interim financial statements as at June 30 , 2022 , were reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs - gesellschaft , Hanover branch ( PwC ) , on behalf of the Audit Commit- tee . The work of the Group Compl iance and Group Internal Audit group functions and reporting on significant risks and incidents are also regular topics at each meeting . This includes in particular the matters described in more detail in the report on risks and opportu- nities and in the no tes to the consolidated financial statements . In addition to these recurring topics , at its meeting on May 4 , 2022 , the Audit Committee discussed the reassignment of 24.9 % of the shares in ContiTech AG , Hanover , from Continental Pension Trust e. V. , Hanov er , to the Continental Group , and was updated on the current status of cybersecurity . At the meeting on August 2 , 2022 , acquisition controlling was treated as a special topic of dis- cussion . The Audit Committee also addressed the review of the interim financial statements by auditor PwC at this meeting . In the absence of the Executive Board , the committee discussed with PwC the focal points to be determined in the audit by the Supervisory Board . At the meeting on November 9 , 2022 , the Audit Committee issued the mandate for the audit of the 2022 annual and consoli- dated financial statements , including the combined non -financial statement , the report on relations with affiliated companies and the remuneration report , to the auditor appointed by the Annual Share- holders \u2019 Meeting , PwC . In addition , the Audit Committee defined an approval framework for commissioning the auditor with permissi- ble non-audit services in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation . The Executive Board regularly informs the Audit Committee abo ut the use of this authorization . The Audit Committee discussed the current status of the cyberattack and initial consequences with the Executive Board and addressed the status of implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensor gfalts - pflichtengesetz ) . The perception of Continental on the capital mar- ket was also discussed . Finally , the Audit Committee extensively ad- dressed the irregularities in the production of air -conditioning lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector and received reports on the current situation . Corporate governance At its meetings on March 17 , 2022 , and December 14 , 2022 , the Supervisory Board agreed to an updated declaration in accordance with Section 161 AktG on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code . At its meeting on September 22 , 2022 , the Supervisory Board approved amendments to the By -Laws of the Supervisory Board and to the By -Laws of the Audit Committee , prompted as a result of the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code . At its meeting on December 14 , 2022 , the Super- visory Board decided on amendments to its profile of skills and ex- pertise , and passed a resolution on the corresponding skills matrix . The chairman of the S upervisory Board was notified of potential conflicts of interest by three Supervisory Board members in 2022 . In such cases , it is ensured that the Supervisory Board members in question do not participate in discussions of the Supervisory Board and its comm ittees on the topics that could constitute a conflict of interest and also do not receive any information in this regard . These are not significant and long -term conflicts of interest that would require the members to step down . In its opinion , the Super- visory Board also had an appropriate number of independent members , in particular on the shareholder side , as defined in the Code at all times in the period under review . Further information on this topic and on corporate governance in general is included in the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB ( starting on page 15 ) . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 15 Responsible corporate governance is what governs the actions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board . Good , responsible corporate governance geared toward sustainable , long-term value creation and in the interests of all stakeholder groups is what governs the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Continental AG . The following corporate governance state- ment pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commer- cial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch \u2013 HGB ) is representative of corporate governance at Continental and is a part of the management report . The remuneration report for fiscal 2022 on the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board together with the auditor \u2019 s report and the valid remuneration system for the remu- neration of the Executive Board are available on Continental \u2019 s web- site under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . The valid remuneration system for remuneration of the Supervisory Board is described in the remuneration repor t for fiscal 2022 and is available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board . Declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the G erman Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz \u2013 AktG ) and deviations from the German Corporate Governance Code ( Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex \u2013 DCGK ) In December 2022 , the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board issued the following annual declaration pursuant to Section 161 AktG : \u201c The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Continental AG declare in accordance with Section 161 German Stock Corpora- tions Act ( AktG ) that the recommendations of the \u2018 Government Commission on the German Cor porate Governance Code \u2019 in the version dated December 16 , 2019 ( published by the Federal Minis- try of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on March 20 , 2020 ) , were complied with since February 18 , 2022 , with the exception as set out below , and fur- ther the recommendations of the \u2018 Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code \u2019 in the version dated April 28 , 2022 ( published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on June 27 , 2022 ) have been complied with and will continue to be complied with , with the exception set out below . Reference is made to the declaration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of March 2022 as well as to previous decla- rations in accordance with Section 161 AktG and the deviations from the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code explained therein . According to recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code , the Supervisory Board shall set an age limit for members of the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board does not set an age limit because it does not consider such a general criterion to be appropriate for evaluating the qualifications of a Supervisory Board member . Hanover , December 2022 Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle Chairman of the Supervisory Board Nikolai Setzer Chairman of the Executive Board \u201d The declaration of compliance is published in the Company/Corpo- rate Governance section of Continental \u2019 s website . Earlier declara- tions pursuant to Section 161 AktG can also be found there . Out -of- date corporate governance statements can also be found there for a period of at least five years from the date they were issued . Key corporate governance practices The following documents are key foundations of our sustaina ble and responsible corporate governance : \u203a OUR BASICS \u2013 Continental AG \u2019 s corporate guidelines . The vision , mission and values , desired behavior and self -image of the Conti- nental Group ; available on Continental \u2019 s website under Com- pany/Corporate Governance/Vision & Mission . \u203a Sustainability ambition ; available on Continental \u2019 s website under Sustainability /Sustainabi lity Framework/Continental \u2019 s Sustainability Ambition . \u203a Compliance with the binding Code of Conduct for all Continental employees . For more information , see Continental \u2019 s website under Sustainability /Sustainable Corporate Governance/ Organi- zation and Management . Corporate bodies In line with the law and the Articles of Incorporation , the company \u2019 s corporate bodies are the Executive Board , the Supervisory Board and the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . As a German stock corporation , Continental AG has a dual management system characterized by a strict personnel d ivision between the Executive Board as the man- agement body and the Supervisory Board as the monitoring body . The cooperation between the Executive Board , Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Meeting is depicted on the next page . The Executive Board and its practices The Executive Board has sole responsibility for managing the com- pany in the interests of the company , free from instructions from third parties in accordance with the law , the Articles of Incorpora- tion and the Executive Board \u2019 s By -Laws , while taking into account the resolutions of the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . All members of the Executive Board share responsibility for the management of the company jointly . Regardless of this principle of joint responsibility , each Executive Board member is individually responsible for the areas entrusted to them . The chairman of the Executive Board is responsible for the company \u2019 s overall management and business policy . He ensures management coordination and uniformity on the Executive Board and represents the company to the public . The Executive Board jointly develops the company \u2019 s strategy , agrees it with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation . Corporate Governance Statement Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 16 The Executive Board had five members as at December 31 , 2022 , and as at the date of this statement . Information on areas of respon- sibility and resumes of the Executive Board members are available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Govern- ance/Executive Board . From May 1 , 2023 , the Executive Board will be expanded to six members following the Supervisory Board \u2019 s de- cision to create a new Executive Board function for Integrity and Law on December 14 , 2022 ( for details , see the report of the Super - visory Board , page 12 ) . The first time a person is appointed to the Executive Board , his or her term as a rule is three years only . As a rule , a member of the Executive Board is not appointed beyond the statutory retirement age . Only under exceptional circumstances will a member of the Execu- tive Board be reappoint ed earlier than one year prior to the end of their term of appointment with simultaneous annulment of their current appointment . More information on the members of the Executive Board and their memberships to be disclosed pursuant to Section 285 No . 10 HGB can be found on page 219 and on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/ Executive Board . The Executive Board has By -Laws that regulate in particular the allocation of duties among the Executive Board members , key matters pertaining to the company and its subsidiaries that require a decision to be made by the Executive Board , the duties of th e Executive Board chairman , and the process in which the Executive Board passes resolutions . The Executive Board By -Laws are availa- ble on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Govern- ance/Executive Board . The Supervisory Board By -Laws on the basis of the Articles of Incorporation require the consent of the Super- visory Board for significant actions taken by management . The Executive Board has established separate boards for the Auto- motive , Tires and ContiTech group sectors . This measure supports the decentralization of responsibility that the global o rganization of the company seeks to achieve , and relieves the burden on the Continental Group Executive Board . In addition to establishing these boards , the Executive Board has delegated to them decision -mak- ing powers for certain matters that affect only the relevant group sectors . The boards for the three group sectors each comprise the Executive Board member responsible for the group sector in question as their chairman , the heads of the relevant business areas within the group sector , as well as furthe r members from among the central functions of the relevant group sectors . The Supervisory Board and its practices The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive Board and collaborates with the Executive Board to develop a long - term succession plan . The Supervisory Board discusses this at least once a year without the Executive Board . In order to become ac- quainted with potential successors , the Supervisory Board , in con- sultation with the Executive Board , offers them the opportunity to deliver presentations to the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in managing the company . This includes , in particular , issues relating to the company \u2019 s strategy , planning , business development , risk sit- uation , risk management , compliance and sustainability . The Super- visory Board is directly involved in decisions of material importance Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 17 to the company . As specified by law , the Articles of Incorporation or the Supervisory Board By -Laws , certain corporate mana gement matters require the approval of the Supervisory Board . The chair- man of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and represents it vis-\u00e0-vis third parties . Within reasonable limits , he is prepared to talk to investors about issues specific to the S upervisory Board . He maintains regular contact between meetings with the Executive Board , and in particular with its chairman , to discuss issues relating in particular to the company \u2019 s strategy , business development , risk situation , risk management and compliance . Composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board comprises 20 members in accordance with the German Co -determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz \u2013 MitbestG ) and the company \u2019 s Articles of Incorporation . Half the members o f the Supervisory Board are elected individually by the shareholders in the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting ( shareholder representa- tives ) , while the other half are elected by the employees of Conti- nental AG and its German subsidiaries ( employee representatives ) . Both the shareholder representatives and the employee represent- atives have an equal duty to act in the interests of the company . The Supervisory Board \u2019 s chairman must be a shareholder repre- sentative . He has the casting vote in the event of a tie . The current Supervisory Board was constituted on April 26 , 2019 . The term of office of the Supervisory Board members lasts until the end of the 2024 Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . The chairman of the Supervisory Board is Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle who , in ac- cordance with the German Corporate Governance Code , is inde- pendent of the company and its Executive Board . The Supervisory Board does not include any members who previously belonged to the Executive Board of Continental AG , who exercise an executive function or advisory role at a major competitor of Continental , or who have a personal relationship with such a competitor . The company has set up an informational program that provides newly elected members of the Supervisory Board with a thorough overview of the c ompany \u2019 s products and technologies as well as finances , controlling and corporate governance at Continental . The Supervisory Board has drawn up its own By -Laws that supple- ment the law and the Articles of Incorporation with more detailed provisions , including provisions on Supervisory Board meetings , the duty of confidentiality , the handling of conflicts of interest and the Executive Board \u2019 s reporting obligations , and a list of transac- tions and measures that require the approval of the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board By -Laws are available on Continen- tal \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board also consults o n a regular basis in the absence of the Executive Board . Before each regular meeting of the Supervisory Board , the representatives of the shareholders and of the employees each meet separately with members of the Exec- utive Board to discuss the upcoming mee ting . The Supervisory Board regularly reviews how effectively it and its committees have fulfilled their responsibilities . It recently carried out such a review in 2021 with the help of an external consultant . This confirmed the Supervisory Board \u2019 s efficie nt and professional approach to its work in the past years . The Supervisory Board has adopted the recommendations that resulted from the 2021 self - assessment and , among other things , resolved to hold an addi- tional regular meeting each fiscal year and to co ordinate more closely with the Executive Board , including outside of meetings . Profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board In accordance with recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code , the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of skills and expertise and specified targets for its composition . The Supervisory Board as a whole should possess the skills and expertise described in more detail below . It is not expected that all Supervisory Board members possess all skills an d expertise . Instead , each area of expertise must be covered by at least one Supervisory Board member . The Supervisory Board assumes that all Supervisory Board members possess the knowledge and skills required for the proper performance of their duties a nd the charac- teristics necessary for successful Supervisory Board work . In partic- ular , these include integrity , commitment , capacity for discussion and teamwork , sufficient availability and discretion . \u203a Internationality : Due to Continental AG \u2019 s global activities , its Supervisory Board requires international professional or business experience . This means professional training or operational activ- ity abroad . International professional and business experience with regard to Asian markets is a lso desirable . \u203a Industry experience : The Supervisory Board should have professional experience in the automotive industry or other in- dustries in which the company operates . In particular , the Super- visory Board wants to increase its expertise in business a reas that are important to the company \u2019 s strategy . Therefore , professional knowledge or experience of information technology , software , telecommunications , mobility services , digital business models or related areas should be available . \u203a Financial expert ise : The Supervisory Board should possess finan- cial knowledge and experience pursuant to Section 100 ( 5 ) AktG as well as recommendation D.3 of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code , i.e . in the areas of accounting , internal control and risk management syste ms , and the audit of financial statements . \u203a Corporate governance and board experience : Members of the Supervisory Board should have experience as a member of the supervisory board or executive board of a German listed com- pany or as a member of such a body o f a foreign listed company . \u203a Sustainability expertise : The Supervisory Board should have in - depth knowledge and experience in the sustainability issues that are relevant to the company . \u203a Organizational and human resources development : The Supervisory Board should have expertise in the area of HR strategy , HR management and labor relations , and in particular knowledge and practical experience in the transformation of companies , including the impact on changing skills requirements for staff . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 18 The Supervisory B oard has specified the following targets for its composition : \u203a The number of members of the Supervisory Board who have the required international experience should at a minimum remain con- stant . Eleven members currently have international experience . \u203a An appropriate number of members with industry experience should be maintained . This applies to 16 of the members . \u203a The Supervisory Board should have an appropriate number of members on the shareholder side whom it deems to be independ- ent in accordance with the G erman Corporate Governance Code . Taking into account the ownership structure , a Supervisory Board member is therefore considered independent if they are independ- ent of the company and its Executive Board , and also independ- ent of a controlling shareholder . The independence of shareholder representatives was assessed in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code by shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board . As part of the assessment of independence from the Executive Board and the company , it was taken into ac- count that four shareholder representatives will have been mem- bers of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years in 2023 . It was also taken i nto consideration in the assessment of independ- ence from any controlling shareholder that two Supervisory Board members are linked to the controlling shareholder , the IHO Group , Herzogenaurach , Germany . As determined in the assess- ment by the shareholder re presentatives on the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board still has an appropriate number of members on the shareholder side who are independent in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code . This assessment is based on the following consid erations : \u203a More than half of the shareholder representatives should be independent of Continental AG and its Executive Board . In the assessment of the independence of the four shareholder repre- sentatives that have been on the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years , given the former and ongoing administration of the members in question , the shareholder representatives over- all see no grounds to accept changing the existing assessment of independence . The shareholder representatives currently on the Supervisory Board are therefore all , without exception , inde- pendent of Continental AG and its Executive Board . \u203a At least five shareholder representatives should be independent of the controlling shareholder , the IHO Group , headquartered in Herzogenaurach , Germany . The shareholder representatives in- dependent of the controlling shareholder are : \u203a Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle \u203a Dorothea von Boxberg ( as of April 29 , 2022 ) \u203a Stefan E. Buchner \u203a Dr. Gunter Dunkel \u203a Satish Khatu \u203a Isabel Corinna Knauf \u203a Sabine Neu\u00df \u203a Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher \u203a In its nominations for election to the Supervisory Board , the Super- visory Board as a rule does not nominate candidates who have al- ready held this position for three full terms of office at the time of the election . \u203a The Supervisory Board has not stipulated an age limit as recom- mended in recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code . It does not consider such a general criterion to be suitable for evaluating the qualifications of a candidate \u2019 s nomina- tion to the Supervisory Boar d. According to Section 96 ( 2 ) AktG , the Supervisory Board of Conti- nental AG is also subject to the requirement that at least 30 % of its members be women and at least 30 % be men . The company re- ports on this on page 22 , in accordance with Section 289f ( 2 ) Nos . 4 to 6 HGB . In its nominations of candidates for election to the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board takes into account the requirements of the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole as well as the aforementioned targets . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 20 Committees of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board currently has five committees with decision - making powers : the Chairman \u2019 s Committee , the Audit Committee , the Nomination Committee , the committee formed in accordance with Section 27 ( 3 ) MitbestG ( the Mediation Committee ) and the committe e for the approval of company transactions with related persons ( Committee for Related Party Transactions ) ( Section 107 ( 3 ) Sentence 4 ; Section 111b ( 1 ) AktG ) . Key responsibilities of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee are preparing the appointment of Executive Board members and concluding , ter- minating and amending their employment contracts and other agreements with them . However , the plenum of the Supervisory Board alone is responsible for establishing the total remun eration of the Executive Board members . Another key responsibility of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee is deciding on the approval of certain trans- actions and measures by the company as specified in the Super- visory Board By -Laws . The Supervisory Board has conferre d some of these participation rights on the Chairman \u2019 s Committee , each member of which may however , in individual cases , demand that a matter again be submitted to the plenary session for decision . The members of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle ( chairman ) ; his vice chairperson , Christiane Benner ; Georg F. W. Schaeffler ; and J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nfelder . The Audit Committee primarily deals with the audit of the ac- counts , the monitoring of the accounting process and the effective- ness of the i nternal control system , the risk management system and the internal audit system , the audit of the financial statements ( including sustainability reporting and examination thereof ) and compliance . In particular , the committee deals with the preliminary examination of Continental AG \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements , and makes its recommenda- tion to the plenary session of the Supervisory Board , which then passes resolutions pursuant to Section 171 AktG . Furthermore , the committee discusses the company \u2019 s draft interim financial reports . It is also responsible for ensuring the necessary independence of the auditor and deals with additional services performed by the auditor . The committee engages the auditor , determines the focus of the report as necessary , negotiates the fee and regularly reviews the quality of the audit . The chairman of the Audit Committee regu- larly consults with the auditor on the progress of the audit and re- ports on this to the committee . The committee al so regularly con- sults with the auditor without the Executive Board . It also gives its recommendation for the Supervisory Board \u2019 s proposal to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting for the election of the auditor . The Audit Committee is also responsible for the preliminary audit of non - financial reporting and for the engagement of an auditor for its re- view , if any . The chairman of the Audit Committee is Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher . He is independent in all respects as defined in the German Corporate Governance Co de . As an auditor with many years of professional experience in management positions , he has in-depth knowledge and experience in auditing . Another commit- tee member , Klaus Rosenfeld , is also a financial expert , and as chief financial officer in a number of companies has in -depth knowledge and experience in accounting and internal control and risk man- agement systems . The other members are Francesco Grioli , Michael Iglhaut , Dirk Nordmann and Georg F. W. Schaeffler . Neither a former Executive Board member nor the chairman of the Supervisory Board may act as chairman of the Audit Committee . The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating suita- ble candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting for election . In addition , the committee must propose targets for the Supervisory Board \u2019 s composition and profile of skills and expertise and review both regularly . The Nomination Committee consists entirely of shareholder representatives , specifi- cally the two members of the Chairm an \u2019 s Committee , Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle ( chairman ) and Georg F. W. Schaeffler ; the chairman of the Audit Committee , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher ; and Isabel Corinna Knauf . In accordance with Section 31 ( 3 ) Sentence 1 MitbestG , the Media- tion Committee becomes active only if the first round of voting on a proposal to appoint a member of the Executive Board or to re- move a member by consent does not achieve the legally required two-thirds majority . This committee must then attempt mediation before a new vote is taken . The members of the Chairman \u2019 s Com- mittee are also the members of the Mediation Committee . The Committee for Related Party Transactions ( RPT Commit- tee ) deals with transactions between Continental AG and a related person , where these t ransactions require the prior consent of Con- tinental AG \u2019 s Supervisory Board in accordance with Sections 111a and 111b AktG . Transactions in this case require the prior consent of the Supervisory Board . In addition to the chairman of the Super- visory Board , Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , and the chairman of the Audit Committee , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher , the Committee for Related Party Transactions includes two further members elected by the Supervisory Board from among the employee representatives where necessary . The Special Emissions Committee and the Special ContiT ech Committee support the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investigations into the manipulation of emission limits by certain automotive manufactur- ers and irregularities in the production of air condition ing lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sec- tor , respectively . In particular , the special committees are available to external law firms as a point of contact , source of information and recipient of reports , regularly rep ort to the plenary session on the investigations and prepare any resolutions required for the ple- nary session or committees . The members of the Special Emissions Committee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , Georg F. W. Schaeffler and Dirk Nordmann . The m embers of the Special ContiTech Com- mittee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher and Dirk Nordmann . Finally , the Supervisory Board has formed a group of experts that deals with sustainability issues relevant to Continental . The gr oup of experts comprises two shareholder representatives and two employee representatives . More information on the members of the Supervisory Board and its committees can be found on pages 220 and 221 . Current resumes , which are updated annually , are available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board They also contain information on how long each member has held their position on the Supervisory Board .

Management , organization and responsibilities Within the Executive Board , the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations ( director of Labor Relations ) and Group Sustaina- bility is responsible for sustainability . Sustainabil ity management within the Continental Group is regulated by a dedicated internal sustainability policy . The Group Sustainability group function is further supplemented by sustainability functions in the group sectors as well as coordina- tors in several business areas and countries . The key sustainability functions were expanded and strengthened in 2022 . The Group Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for as- sessing interdepartmental issues , weighing up risks and opportuni- ties and discus sing relevant Executive Board decisions in advance . In fiscal 2022 , it consisted of the entire Executive Board as well as the heads of the sustainability functions at corporate level and group sector level as well as the heads of other relevant group funct ions . The committee is chaired by the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations ( director of Labor Relations ) and Group Sustaina- bility and managed by the head of the Group Sustainability group function . Some of the group sectors have their own inter depart- mental sustainability committees , which are coordinated by the relevant sustainability functions . The sustainability performance indicators are consolidated in the Continental Group \u2019 s sustainability scorecard , which is approved annually by the Grou p Sustainability Steering Committee on behalf of the Executive Board . The scorecard is based on defined quality criteria for the indicators , is continuously developed further and establishes the formal basis for integrating sustainability into other corporate processes . The topic of sustainability is also an integral part of the Continental Group \u2019 s strategy development . Significant investments must be re- viewed and assessed as to their contribution to sustainability as a standard part of the approval process . For the Autom otive , Tires and ContiTech group sectors , detailed roadmaps for the implementation of sustainability ambitions in the relevant topic areas are under de- velopment . Remuneration The Executive Board and managers are measured against the achievement of sustain ability goals . Long -term remuneration com- ponents ( long -term incentive \u2013 LTI ) are thus linked to sustainability aspects . The LTI plans are updated on an annual basis . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Executi ve Board . Cultural change In order to support cultural change in the organization , we stepped up internal communication with respect to sustainability in fiscal 2022 , held numerous events and further integrated the topic into key internal event formats for managers . These events include the annual Global Sustainability Conference , which is attended by Con- tinental employees from all over the world . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 42 Results of the concept The waste for recovery quota was at 85 % in fiscal 2022 ( PY : 81 % ) . This was mainly due to the successful implementation of local pro- jects as well as to market conditions , which allowed for increased waste rec overy .

For more information on the circular economy , see the integrated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Responsible value chain Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we strive for 100 % respon- sible sourcing and business partnerships by 2050 at the latest , to- gether with our partners along the value chain . Our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations . Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers , industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks . Concept In the reporting year , a comprehensive management system for ensuring due diligence within a responsible value chain was devel- oped and launched . The global implementation of the system in stages is designed to achieve continuous improvement and to re- spect both human and environmental rights along the value chain . This covers both Continental \u2019 s own operations and in particular those of direct suppliers . For this purpose , responsibilities , rules and processes are clearly defined , including control mechanisms . The management system is guided by specific commitments in the areas of labor standards , occupational health and safety , the environment , safety practices and land rights . The aim of the system is to ensure the corresponding laws are observed and recognized , in particular the requirements under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ) . It is also aimed at system- atically applying due diligence procedures , reducing risks , support- ing the implementation of customer requirements and supplement- ing the existing internal control system . Within the system , our Business Partner Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements , among others for our suppliers , and for their suppliers , including with regard to human rights , working conditions , environmental protection , conflict minerals an d anti- corruption . The Code of Conduct is updated regularly to reflect changes or adjustments to legislation . For suppliers of natural rub- ber , our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber additionally applies . Violations of our rules can be reported via the Integrity Hot- line , which is available around the clock and worldwide . When Continental is notified about violations of our Business Part- ner Code of Conduct , these will be checked , and , if necessary , fur- ther appropriate measures will be initiated n ecessary . Where busi- ness partners are proven to have violated our Business Partner Code of Conduct , Continental requests and monitors remedial measures and reserves the right to terminate the business relation- ship as a last resort . Sustainability aspects a re also taken into consideration at various other points in supplier management . For example , selected suppli- ers are evaluated based on various criteria using self-assessment questionnaires , which we collect via the generally accepted sustain- ability platfo rms for our industries , such as EcoVadis and NQC . These questionnaires are reviewed annually at the corporate level . Furthermore , selective local audits or other audit activities \u2013 such as in relation to the existence of management systems \u2013 are also carried out . We also continue to develop our approach for the responsible value chain in dialog with external stakeholders and support the development of industry -wide standards , for example through our participation in industry dialog with the German governmen t on human rights in the automotive industry . Here , we have worked in particular to cultivate a shared understanding of industry risks and due diligence requirements . We are also involved in initiatives and associations such as econsense , the Responsible B usiness Alliance ( RBA ) and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber ( GPSNR ) . Responsible sourcing is the responsibility of the relevant purchas- ing organizations , which are established at Continental by group sector , product group and country , for example . A corporate pur- chasing network regularly deals with responsible sourcing topi cs as well . The Group Quality group function coordinates the manage- ment of conflict minerals , including the corresponding reporting processes . Results of the concept To further increase transparency and sustainability in Continental \u2019 s natural rubber suppl y chain , the joint venture \u201c Rubberway , \u201d which was founded in 2019 , was rolled out further for the digital risk analy- sis of the upstream supply chain . The joint project with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit ( GIZ ) in the Indone- sian province of West Kalimantan , which has been in place since 2018 , was also further expanded . The aim of the project is to jointly drive forward the implementation of a digital system for the tracea- bility of natural rubber from the project reg ion . By optimizing the supply chain and offering training in the sustainable cultivation of natural rubber , smallholders are supported in boosting the quantity , quality and yield of their produce and in this way improving their income . In addition , a culti vation strategy designed around sustain- ability prevents clearing and deforestation , thereby conserving val- uable resources . As part of a development project with Security Matters ( SMX ) , Continental is working on testing a tamper -proof means of verification of the geographical origin of natural rubber using marker technologies . In fiscal 2022 , field testing was success- fully completed , and the marker substance could be verified beyond doubt throughout the entire tire production process . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 43 As at December 31 , 2022 , 1,009 valid supplier self -assessment questionnaires were available via the two sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC ( PY : 631 ) . This corresponds to a completion rate of 63 % of suppliers selected for this process ( PY : 53 % ) . The increase in the number of available valid supplier self -assessment question- naires and the higher completion rate are due to the onboarding of ContiTech suppliers in EcoVadis and the follow -up activities with suppliers to update and renew their self -assessment questionnaires . Responsible value chain performance indicator 2022 2021 Number of available valid supplier self-assessment questionnaires ( as at December 31 ) 1 1,009 631 1 Based on the self -assessment questionnaires via the sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC completed by suppliers selected for this process . We present further performance indicators for the implementation of a responsible value chain with regard to our own locations in the sections on good working conditions as well as green and safe fac- tories in this combined non -financial statement . For more information on the responsible value chain , see the inte- grated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Good working conditions Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we provide inspiring , healthy and fair working conditions . Concept The Continental Group \u2019 s Code of Conduct sets out the foundation for good working conditions as the basis of our global collabora- tion , including respect for human rights and fair working condi- tions . Employees receive training on compliance with the Code of Conduct . The management system being rolled out for a responsi- ble value chain also includes the company \u2019 s own activities ( see re- sponsible value chain ) . Our HR strategy is geared toward meeting staffing requirements in terms of both quantity and quality . The two HR strategy initiatives \u201c Industrialize Best Fit \u201d and \u201c Enable Transformation \u201d are therefore fo- cused on efficiently and effectively bringing together the right peo- ple and positions and shaping the digital and technological transfor- mation and cultural shift toward new forms of collaboration . Work- force planning , the search for , diagnostic selection and development of talent ( in particular in the areas of software and IT ) , the promotion of employee diversity and lifelong learning , the further development of the management culture and the flexibilization of working hou rs are therefore essential action fields of strategic HR work . We are tackling the impact of our Transformation 2019 \u20132029 structural program , which among other things is associated with the transformation in mobility and is likely to change up to 23,000 jobs worldwide , with targeted training measures for the employees affected . New career prospects and employment opportunities are to be opened up on the internal as well as the external employ- ment markets . Those responsible for HR are the HR functions at Continental Group , group sector , business area and country level , which work together in a global network . A special network of country coordi- nators for labor relations is also part of this organization . We measure the success of HR work against the OUR BA SICS Live Sustainable Engagement index , which is calculated on the basis of the annual employee survey . The index measures employee agree- ment on topics such as whether they personally back the company values and whether they are proud to work for Continent al . Other performance indicators we consult are the sickness rate and the unforced fluctuation rate . The sickness rate measures sickness -re- lated absence relative to contractual work time , and the unforced fluctuation rate measures the voluntary departure o f employees from the company relative to the average number of employees . The OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index has also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board and managers since fiscal 2020 . The sickness rate is also part of this , although only for the plans launched in fiscal 2020 . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . Results of the concept In fiscal 2022 , the Sustainable Engagement in dex was 80 % ( PY : 80 % ) and therefore on par with the previous year . The sickness rate was unchanged at 3.7 % ( PY : 3.7 % ) . For the unforced fluctuation rate , we recorded a slight increase to 7.8 % ( PY : 7.0 % ) . Information about personnel expenses in fiscal 20 22 ( i.e . wages and salaries , social security contributions and pension and post - employment benefit costs ) can be found in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated statement of income in this annual report . Em- ployee benefits such as pensions , post -employmen t benefits and long-term bonus payments are broken down in Note 29 of the notes to the consolidated statement of financial position . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 45 Benchmark in quality Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we are recognized by our customers and society as being a benchmark in quality by ensur- ing safe and sustainable products . Concept The decisi ve factor in becoming a benchmark in quality is a quality - oriented company culture . Our quality policy sets out guidelines for product and process quality at Continental . Product recalls , product liability claims and proceedings as a result of quality defe cts repre- sent a business risk that we want to avoid due to the resulting losses of sales , costs , and loss of customer and market acceptance . For more information , see the report on risks and opportunities in this annual report . Local management systems dr ive forward the implementation of these guidelines . The concrete organizational and technical require- ments can be found in the relevant quality management manuals for the group sectors . The extent of these certifications is assessed on an annual basis as t o how many employees they cover with re- spect to quality management systems . The number of new field quality events is used as an effectiveness indicator for our quality management . A field quality event is a risk -minimizing measure for a product manufactur ed and/or sold by Continental on the basis of a safety-related defect and/or non -compliance with regulations that was initiated by Continental , a customer and/or an authority . The Group Quality group function as well as the quality functions at various lev els in the Continental Group , which work together in a global network , are responsible for the strategic , corporate -wide quality management process . Results of the concept As at December 31 , 2022 , certified quality management systems covered 83 % of our em ployees throughout the Continental Group ( PY : 84 % ) . Thirty new field quality events were identified in fiscal 2022 ( PY : 36 ) .

For more information on benchmark in quality , see the integrated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Sustainable management practice Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we implement effective management processes , fair business practices and responsible cor- porate governance with a balanced view of different perspectives . Concept Group Compliance , which is divided into a central team and regional functions , is responsible for preventing violations in the areas of cor- ruption , antitrust law , money laundering and data protection . This structure is supplemented by compliance coordinators in the coun- tries and at the locations . The fund amental principles of compli- ance management are set out in the Continental Group \u2019 s compli- ance manual . Continental strives for a holistic compliance management system based on a comprehensive analysis of potential compliance risks , followed by the implemen tation of appropriate policies and proce- dures , training , consulting , monitoring and controls that lead to on- going lessons learned and system improvements . The Integrity Hotline and an ombudsman \u2019 s office are on hand to offer support in the detection of vio lations . As a further cornerstone for sustainable management practice , we are committed to promoting employee diversity , which we under- stand as internationality , a balanced gender ratio , and a range of ex- periences and age categories . We have set ourselves the corporate target of increasing the share of female executives and senior exec- utives to 25 % by 2025 and to up to 30 % by 2030 . We intend to achieve this in particular by promoting cultural change in the organization through the expansion of women \u2019 s networks and the holding of diversity workshops and specific events . Gender diversity \u2013 the share of female executives and senior executives \u2013 has also been part of the LTI plans for the mem- bers of the Executive Board and global managers since fiscal 2020 . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . For more information on sustainable management practice and our diversity concept , see the Corporate Governance section of this annual report . For more information on compliance , see the \u201c Struc- ture of the internal control system \u201d section in the report on risks and opportunities . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Report on Risks and Opportunities 88 The overall situation is analyzed and managed corporate -wide using the risk and opportunity management system . The management of Continental is geared toward sustainably in- creasing the value of each individual operating unit . We evaluate risks and opportunities contin ually and responsibly to achieve our goal of adding value . We define risk as the possibility of internal or external events occur- ring that can have a negative influence on the attainment of our strategic and operational targets . As a global corporation , C ontinen- tal is exposed to a number of different risks , in particular due to the transformation in the mobility industry , that could impair business and , in extreme cases , threaten the company \u2019 s existence . At the same time , this transformation also presents opportunities that we intend to consistently seize , as described in the Strategy of the Continental Group section . We accept manageable risks if the re- sulting opportunities are expected to result in sustainable growth in value . We consider growth in value in terms of the Continental Value Contribution ( CVC ) system described in the Corporate Man- agement section . Continental \u2019 s Internal Control System The governance systems at Continental comprise the internal con- trol system , the risk management system and \u2013 as part of the risk management system \u2013 the compliance management system . The risk management system in turn also includes the early risk identifi- cation system in accordance with Section 91 ( 2 ) of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz \u2013 AktG ) . The Executive Board is responsible for the governance systems , which include all subsidiaries . The Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee monitor the effectiveness of these systems . Structure of the internal control system In order to operate successfully as a company in a complex business environment and to ensure the effectiveness , efficiency and propriety of all processes and compliance with the relevant legal and sub -legis- lative regulations , Continental has established an internal control sys- tem that encompasses all relevant business processes . Key elements of the corporate -wide internal control system are the clear allocation of responsibilities and system -inherent controls in the respective process flows . The two -person rule and separation of functions are fundamental principles of this organization . Continen- tal \u2019 s management also issues guidelines to ensure that all business processes are conducted in an economical , orderly and legally compliant manner . Based on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable guidelines , the internal control system at Continental follows the Three Lines Model . In the first line , system-inherent controls are configured in the company \u2019 s IT systems to support the orderly and economical exe- cution of all process flow transactions in accordance with the cor- porate-wide guidelines . At the same time , these transactional con- trols help to identify risks and deviations that require separate con- sideration . As the controls and process flows established in the first line apply to Continental \u2019 s operating business , they are generally put in place at the level of our operating units , such as our subsidi- aries , business areas and group sectors . In the second line of our internal control system , guidelines for process flows are developed , implemented and updated and com- pliance with controls and guidelines is monitored . Responsibility for this lies primarily with the group functions , in addition to the busi- ness areas and group sectors . The responsibilities include , for ex- ample , the risk management system and the compliance manage- ment system . In order to perform this superv isory and monitoring function , an integrated reporting system has been established that includes , for example , the financial reporting internal control sys- tem ( Financial Reporting ICS ) , the general risk management sys- tem , the compliance risk management sys tem and the tax compli- ance management system . The supervisory and monitoring func- tion is performed on the basis of regular reports and supplemented as needed with effectiveness tests as part of self -audits and regular internal and external reviews . The com pliance management system plays an important role within the second line of defense by helping to prevent , detect and respond to compliance violations . The Group Compliance group function is responsible for the compliance management system . The chief compl iance officer reports directly to the chairman of the Executive Board . The work done by Group Compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting corruption , fraud and other property offenses , violations of antitrust and competition law and money launder ing ; implementing data protection ; and responding to compliance violations . For other legal areas in which there is a risk of compliance violations , responsibility for appropriate and effective compliance management lies with the respective functions , whic h are supported in these tasks by Group Compliance . An effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention . It be- gins with setting an appropriate \u201c tone from the top \u201d by the Executive Board and management and , in addition to risk analysis , includes in particular employee training , compliance consulting and the inter- nal publication of guidelines . In the course of risk analysis , the business activities of Continental are examined for compliance risks within the scope of top -down as Report on Risks and Opportunities Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Report on Risks and Opportunities 89 well as bottom -up review processes . The risk of compliance viola- tions arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows , the given market situation and activities in certain geographical re- gions . Furthermore , findings from investigations by the Group Inter- nal Audit group function as well as discussions with management and employees at all hierarchical levels are taken into account . This risk analysis is not a one -off procedure , but is performed annually and continuously updated . Prevention is also fostered by cons ultation on specific matters with Group Compliance and by the internal publication of guidelines on topics such as anti -corruption ( including giving and receiving gifts as well as donations and sponsoring ) , antitrust and competition law , anti-money launder ing and data protection . In training events , Group Compliance addresses topics directly related to everyday compli- ance issues and challenges . Continental introduced the Business Partner Code of Conduct to prevent compliance violations by suppliers , service providers , rep- resentatives or similar third parties . This must be recognized as a basic requirement for doing business with Continental . In the context of detection , Continental has set up an Integrity Hot- line to give employees and third parties outside t he Continental Group the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations , its fundamental values and ethical standards . Information on any kind of potential violations , including accounting manipulation , can be reported anonymously via this hotline . The hotline is available world- wide in many different languages . The company \u2019 s investigating units rigorously pursue any and all substantiated leads . Detection also includes the support of regular and incident -related audits conducted by Group Internal Aud it . Compliance -related is- sues are regularly the subject of audits by Group Internal Audit . Responses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence of identified compliance violations . Group Compliance is involved in decision-making on measures that m ay be required , including thor- ough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms of failings in the system . In this way , corresponding gaps can be closed preventively and the compliance management system , as well as the internal control syste m , can be systematically developed . The third line of our internal control system is our Group Internal Audit group function . Group Internal Audit serves an independent and objective auditing and advisory function , applying a systematic approach to help r e- view , assess and improve the adequacy and effectiveness of the or- ganization \u2019 s governance systems . Continental \u2019 s Executive Board au- thorizes Group Internal Audit to conduct audits in all regions , com- panies or functions of Continental AG and its affiliated , fully consoli- dated subsidiaries worldwide . Group Internal Audit prepares an annual risk -oriented audit plan that is submitted to Continental \u2019 s Executive Board for review and approval . In addition to its planned general audits , Group Internal Audit also co nducts special investigations . These are based on tips and information about fraudulent acts received from internal or external sources such as the Integrity Hotline or the ombudsman \u2019 s office . Group Internal Audit regularly reports its audit and investiga tion re- sults to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee . Significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies . The imple- mentation by management of the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and re- ported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee . Appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system The three -tier structure of the internal control system at Cont inen- tal and the associated guidelines and processes introduced world- wide fundamentally ensure that the relevant business processes are performed properly , economically and in compliance with legal regulations . Nevertheless , an internal control system canno t pro- vide complete protection , particularly if internal controls and guide- lines are intentionally circumvented . To proactively prevent and de- tect such circumvention , Continental has established monitoring functions at the various levels of the internal con trol system . Group Internal Audit assumes a particularly important role in this regard . Internal monitoring of compliance with internal controls is supple- mented by information we receive from external audits , for exam- ple as part of ISO certifications , cust omer and supplier audits , com- pany audits , customs audits and IT audits . These findings are taken into account when updating and making necessary adjustments to our internal control system . Continental \u2019 s Executive Board is kept continuously informed of the results of internal audit activities , external audits and governance system reporting , all of which form the basis for the Executive Board \u2019 s assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system . The increased volatility of our business environment , the transfor- mation of the automotive industry , the ever faster pace of techno- logical development and the necessary consideration of sustaina- bility aspects have shown that an internal control system must be continuously adapted"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

We closely supervised , carefu lly monitored and advised the Executive Board in the management of the company . We were directly involved in a timely manner in all decisions of fun- damental importance to the company . The Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular , timely and comprehensive updates at its meetings as well as ver- bally and in writing on all issues of relevance to the company . In particular , these include the business performance , business strat- egy , planning , significant business transactions in the company an d the Continental Group , and the related risks and opportunities , as well as compliance issues . The members of the Supervisory Board were also available to the Executive Board for consultation outside the meetings . As chairman of the Supervisory Board , I h ad regular contact with the members of the Executive Board , in particular with its chairman , and discussed current company issues and develop- ments with them . Pursuant to a suggestion of the German Corpo- rate Governance Code , I also held discussions with inv estors in 2022 on topics specific to the Supervisory Board . Meetings of the Supervisory Board and the committees Meetings of the Supervisory Board took place both virtually and in person in fiscal 2022 . In total , the Supervisory Board convened for five ordinary meetings and one extraordinary meeting in 2022 , as well as for the strategy meeting . The September and December meetings and the strategy meeting were held in person , while the other meetings took place virtually . At its meetings , the Supervisory Board regularly conferred part of the time in the absence of the Executive Board . In addition to these meetings , the Supervisory Board passed two resolutions by written procedure , one of which was passed only by the shareholder representatives . The Chairman \u2019 s Committee held two meetings in the reporting year ( one virtually and one in person ) and passed two resolutions by written procedure . The Audit Committee met four times virtually in 2022 and passed one resolution by written procedure . The Nomi- nation Comm ittee passed one resolution by written procedure and also prepared the appointment of a new member to the Supervisory Board and the revision of its profile of skills and expertise . The Me- diation Committee in accordance with Section 27 ( 3 ) of the German Co-determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz \u2013 MitbestG ) was not required to meet in 2022 , and neither was the Committee for Re- lated Party Transactions ( RPT Committee ) . The special committee formed in connection with the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investigation into t he manipulation of emission limits by certain automotive manufacturers ( Special Emissions Committee ) met twice in the year under review . At its December meeting , the Supervisory Board additionally formed a further special committee to support the Superviso ry Board \u2019 s investigation into irregularities in the production of air conditioning lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector ( Special Conti - Tech Committee ) . The Special ContiTech Committee did not hold any meetings in the year under review . There are no other committees . All committees report to the plenary session . The corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetz - buch \u2013 HGB ) starting on page 15 describes their responsibilities in more detail and names their members .

Schaeffler 1 / 2 50 Key topics dealt with by the Supervisory Board and the Chairman \u2019 s Committee At each ordinary meeting of the plenary session , the Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board in detail of the sales , results and employment development in the Continental Gr oup and indi- vidual group sectors as well as the financial situation of the com- pany . Where the actual course of business deviated from the de- fined plans and targets , the Executive Board provided detailed expla- nations . It discussed the reasons for these devi ations and the measures introduced in depth with the Supervisory Board . In addi- tion , the Executive Board regularly informed us about the Continen- tal Group \u2019 s main raw materials and sales markets and about Conti- nental AG \u2019 s share price performance . As part of this regular report- ing , the Executive Board also went into detail on the impact of the war in Ukraine on the company . In addition , the work of the Supervisory Board and its collaboration with the Executive Board in the year under review continued to be shaped by the transformation process in the automotive industry and its consequences for the company . Another focus of the Super- visory Board \u2019 s work was again on the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investiga- tion into the manipulation of emission limits in vehicles of spe cific automotive manufacturers , including monitoring of the correspond- ing investigative proceedings by public prosecutors . The Supervisory Board discussed this at each ordinary meeting . The Special Emis- sions Committee formed in connection with this matter also met twice in 2022 . Finally , the Supervisory Board addressed cybersecu- rity and the cyberattack on Continental in detail , as well as the irreg- ularities in the production of air conditioning lines and indus trial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector . At the meeting on March 17 , 2022 , we discussed and subse- quently approved the company \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2021 . We also approved both the decision by the Executive Board to hold the 2022 Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting virtually and the draft agenda for the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting , and resolved the proposed resolutions of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . In addition , we discussed the acquisition of US conveyor belt manufacturer WCCO Belting , LLC , Wilmington , Delaware , USA , by the ContiTech group sector and the sale of a product line from the Automotive group sector . Measures from the Supervisory Board \u2019 s self-assessment in 2021 were also discussed at the meeting , and we resolved to implement the proposed improvement measures . These include , for example , establishing a further regular plenary meeting per fiscal year . We also passed a resolution on the approval in principle of the reassignment of 24.9 % of the shares in ContiTech AG , Hanover , from Continental Pension Trust e. V. , Hanover , to the Continental Group . Final approval on this reassignment was resolved by written procedure at the end of May on the recomme ndation of the Audit Committee . In addition , we resolved to update the declaration in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktien - gesetz \u2013 AktG ) on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code , since the circums tances that required a change to the declaration in connection with the spin -off of Vitesco Tech- nologies Group AG in September 2021 no longer appl ied . At the Supervisory Board meeting on April 29 , 2022 , in addition to the ongoing business development , we also discussed in depth the Continental Group \u2019 s business activities in Russia , particularly with respect to the Tires group sector . We also received reports from the Executive Board on how the company is responding to supply shortages and price increases in the supply of energy . In implementing concrete measures following the Supervisory Board \u2019 s self -assessment , an additional ordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board was held for the first time on June 23 , 2022 . The transformation process in the automotive industry was an important topic of discussion at this meeting . In addition , the head of Compliance reported on the future organizational structure for compliance , and the Executive Board provided an update on the Continental Group \u2019 s current insurance sit uation . At the full -day strategy meeting held on September 21 , 2022 , the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board once again dis- cussed in detail the strategic objectives and strategic planning of the Continental Group , the Automotive group sector ( with a focus on the Autonomous Mobility business area ) and the Tires and Con ti- Tech group sectors , the Continental Group \u2019 s sustainability require- ments and the HR strategy . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 13 action . The Supervisory Board also resolved that a further special committee ( the Special ContiTech Committee ) would support this investigation . The Chairman \u2019 s Committee held two meetings in the year under review , in which it primarily prepared the personnel -related decisions of the plenary session and mad e recommendations for resolutions . At the first meeting on March 17 , 2022 , this included the recom- mendation on determined performance bonuses for fiscal 2021 , which the plenary session resolved at its following meeting . At the second meeting on December 14 , 2022 , the Chairman \u2019 s Commit- tee resolved proposals to the Chairman \u2019 s Committee relating to tar- gets set for the variable remuneration of the Executive Board and to the creation of a new Executive Board function for Integrity and Law . At the end of May , the Chairman \u2019 s Committee also approved the acquisition of US conveyor belt manufacturer WCCO Belting , LLC , Wilmington , Delaware , USA , by written procedure . This acquisi- tion had previously been discussed at the meeting of the plenary session on March 17 , 2022 . In September , the Chairman \u2019 s Commit- tee approved an investment project of the Automotive group sector by written procedure . Key topics dealt with by the Audit Committee The Audit Committee was also informed by the Executive Board in detail and on an ongoi ng basis about sales , results and employment development in the Continental Group and individual group sectors as well as the financial situation of the company . The Executive Board is assisted by the head of Accounting and the head of Group Controlling , w ho attend the meetings of the Audit Committee and can thereby provide information directly . In addition , the chairman of the Audit Committee is in regular contact with the chief financial officer and the auditor of the Continental Group outside of meetings and has access to senior employees entrusted with tasks relating to accounting , the internal control system , the risk management sys- tem , internal auditing and compliance . The chairman of the Audit Committee shares key information with the Audit Committee . As a focus of each of its quarterly meetings , the Audit Committee talks with the Executive Board about the accounting as at the end of the previous quarter and the outlook for the year as a whole as well as the quarterly statements and the half -year fina ncial report prior to their publication . Another focus of the Audit Committee \u2019 s work in the past fiscal year was dealing with the company \u2019 s internal control system and risk management system . At its meeting on March 2 , 2022 , the Audit Committee discussed the company \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the combined non -financial state- ment for 2021 with the Executive Board and the auditor , and rec- ommended their approval to the pl enary session of the Supervisory Board . The interim financial statements as at June 30 , 2022 , were reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs - gesellschaft , Hanover branch ( PwC ) , on behalf of the Audit Commit- tee . The work of the Group Compl iance and Group Internal Audit group functions and reporting on significant risks and incidents are also regular topics at each meeting . This includes in particular the matters described in more detail in the report on risks and opportu- nities and in the no tes to the consolidated financial statements . In addition to these recurring topics , at its meeting on May 4 , 2022 , the Audit Committee discussed the reassignment of 24.9 % of the shares in ContiTech AG , Hanover , from Continental Pension Trust e. V. , Hanov er , to the Continental Group , and was updated on the current status of cybersecurity . At the meeting on August 2 , 2022 , acquisition controlling was treated as a special topic of dis- cussion . The Audit Committee also addressed the review of the interim financial statements by auditor PwC at this meeting . In the absence of the Executive Board , the committee discussed with PwC the focal points to be determined in the audit by the Supervisory Board . At the meeting on November 9 , 2022 , the Audit Committee issued the mandate for the audit of the 2022 annual and consoli- dated financial statements , including the combined non -financial statement , the report on relations with affiliated companies and the remuneration report , to the auditor appointed by the Annual Share- holders \u2019 Meeting , PwC . In addition , the Audit Committee defined an approval framework for commissioning the auditor with permissi- ble non-audit services in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation . The Executive Board regularly informs the Audit Committee abo ut the use of this authorization . The Audit Committee discussed the current status of the cyberattack and initial consequences with the Executive Board and addressed the status of implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensor gfalts - pflichtengesetz ) . The perception of Continental on the capital mar- ket was also discussed . Finally , the Audit Committee extensively ad- dressed the irregularities in the production of air -conditioning lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector and received reports on the current situation . Corporate governance At its meetings on March 17 , 2022 , and December 14 , 2022 , the Supervisory Board agreed to an updated declaration in accordance with Section 161 AktG on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code . At its meeting on September 22 , 2022 , the Supervisory Board approved amendments to the By -Laws of the Supervisory Board and to the By -Laws of the Audit Committee , prompted as a result of the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code . At its meeting on December 14 , 2022 , the Super- visory Board decided on amendments to its profile of skills and ex- pertise , and passed a resolution on the corresponding skills matrix . The chairman of the S upervisory Board was notified of potential conflicts of interest by three Supervisory Board members in 2022 . In such cases , it is ensured that the Supervisory Board members in question do not participate in discussions of the Supervisory Board and its comm ittees on the topics that could constitute a conflict of interest and also do not receive any information in this regard . These are not significant and long -term conflicts of interest that would require the members to step down . In its opinion , the Super- visory Board also had an appropriate number of independent members , in particular on the shareholder side , as defined in the Code at all times in the period under review . Further information on this topic and on corporate governance in general is included in the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB ( starting on page 15 ) . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 15 Responsible corporate governance is what governs the actions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board . Good , responsible corporate governance geared toward sustainable , long-term value creation and in the interests of all stakeholder groups is what governs the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Continental AG . The following corporate governance state- ment pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commer- cial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch \u2013 HGB ) is representative of corporate governance at Continental and is a part of the management report . The remuneration report for fiscal 2022 on the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board together with the auditor \u2019 s report and the valid remuneration system for the remu- neration of the Executive Board are available on Continental \u2019 s web- site under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . The valid remuneration system for remuneration of the Supervisory Board is described in the remuneration repor t for fiscal 2022 and is available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board . Declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the G erman Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz \u2013 AktG ) and deviations from the German Corporate Governance Code ( Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex \u2013 DCGK ) In December 2022 , the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board issued the following annual declaration pursuant to Section 161 AktG : \u201c The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Continental AG declare in accordance with Section 161 German Stock Corpora- tions Act ( AktG ) that the recommendations of the \u2018 Government Commission on the German Cor porate Governance Code \u2019 in the version dated December 16 , 2019 ( published by the Federal Minis- try of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on March 20 , 2020 ) , were complied with since February 18 , 2022 , with the exception as set out below , and fur- ther the recommendations of the \u2018 Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code \u2019 in the version dated April 28 , 2022 ( published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on June 27 , 2022 ) have been complied with and will continue to be complied with , with the exception set out below . Reference is made to the declaration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of March 2022 as well as to previous decla- rations in accordance with Section 161 AktG and the deviations from the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code explained therein . According to recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code , the Supervisory Board shall set an age limit for members of the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board does not set an age limit because it does not consider such a general criterion to be appropriate for evaluating the qualifications of a Supervisory Board member . Hanover , December 2022 Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle Chairman of the Supervisory Board Nikolai Setzer Chairman of the Executive Board \u201d The declaration of compliance is published in the Company/Corpo- rate Governance section of Continental \u2019 s website . Earlier declara- tions pursuant to Section 161 AktG can also be found there . Out -of- date corporate governance statements can also be found there for a period of at least five years from the date they were issued . Key corporate governance practices The following documents are key foundations of our sustaina ble and responsible corporate governance : \u203a OUR BASICS \u2013 Continental AG \u2019 s corporate guidelines . The vision , mission and values , desired behavior and self -image of the Conti- nental Group ; available on Continental \u2019 s website under Com- pany/Corporate Governance/Vision & Mission . \u203a Sustainability ambition ; available on Continental \u2019 s website under Sustainability /Sustainabi lity Framework/Continental \u2019 s Sustainability Ambition . \u203a Compliance with the binding Code of Conduct for all Continental employees . For more information , see Continental \u2019 s website under Sustainability /Sustainable Corporate Governance/ Organi- zation and Management . Corporate bodies In line with the law and the Articles of Incorporation , the company \u2019 s corporate bodies are the Executive Board , the Supervisory Board and the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . As a German stock corporation , Continental AG has a dual management system characterized by a strict personnel d ivision between the Executive Board as the man- agement body and the Supervisory Board as the monitoring body . The cooperation between the Executive Board , Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Meeting is depicted on the next page . The Executive Board and its practices The Executive Board has sole responsibility for managing the com- pany in the interests of the company , free from instructions from third parties in accordance with the law , the Articles of Incorpora- tion and the Executive Board \u2019 s By -Laws , while taking into account the resolutions of the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . All members of the Executive Board share responsibility for the management of the company jointly . Regardless of this principle of joint responsibility , each Executive Board member is individually responsible for the areas entrusted to them . The chairman of the Executive Board is responsible for the company \u2019 s overall management and business policy . He ensures management coordination and uniformity on the Executive Board and represents the company to the public . The Executive Board jointly develops the company \u2019 s strategy , agrees it with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation . Corporate Governance Statement Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 16 The Executive Board had five members as at December 31 , 2022 , and as at the date of this statement . Information on areas of respon- sibility and resumes of the Executive Board members are available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Govern- ance/Executive Board . From May 1 , 2023 , the Executive Board will be expanded to six members following the Supervisory Board \u2019 s de- cision to create a new Executive Board function for Integrity and Law on December 14 , 2022 ( for details , see the report of the Super - visory Board , page 12 ) . The first time a person is appointed to the Executive Board , his or her term as a rule is three years only . As a rule , a member of the Executive Board is not appointed beyond the statutory retirement age . Only under exceptional circumstances will a member of the Execu- tive Board be reappoint ed earlier than one year prior to the end of their term of appointment with simultaneous annulment of their current appointment . More information on the members of the Executive Board and their memberships to be disclosed pursuant to Section 285 No . 10 HGB can be found on page 219 and on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/ Executive Board . The Executive Board has By -Laws that regulate in particular the allocation of duties among the Executive Board members , key matters pertaining to the company and its subsidiaries that require a decision to be made by the Executive Board , the duties of th e Executive Board chairman , and the process in which the Executive Board passes resolutions . The Executive Board By -Laws are availa- ble on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Govern- ance/Executive Board . The Supervisory Board By -Laws on the basis of the Articles of Incorporation require the consent of the Super- visory Board for significant actions taken by management . The Executive Board has established separate boards for the Auto- motive , Tires and ContiTech group sectors . This measure supports the decentralization of responsibility that the global o rganization of the company seeks to achieve , and relieves the burden on the Continental Group Executive Board . In addition to establishing these boards , the Executive Board has delegated to them decision -mak- ing powers for certain matters that affect only the relevant group sectors . The boards for the three group sectors each comprise the Executive Board member responsible for the group sector in question as their chairman , the heads of the relevant business areas within the group sector , as well as furthe r members from among the central functions of the relevant group sectors . The Supervisory Board and its practices The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive Board and collaborates with the Executive Board to develop a long - term succession plan . The Supervisory Board discusses this at least once a year without the Executive Board . In order to become ac- quainted with potential successors , the Supervisory Board , in con- sultation with the Executive Board , offers them the opportunity to deliver presentations to the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in managing the company . This includes , in particular , issues relating to the company \u2019 s strategy , planning , business development , risk sit- uation , risk management , compliance and sustainability . The Super- visory Board is directly involved in decisions of material importance Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 17 to the company . As specified by law , the Articles of Incorporation or the Supervisory Board By -Laws , certain corporate mana gement matters require the approval of the Supervisory Board . The chair- man of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and represents it vis-\u00e0-vis third parties . Within reasonable limits , he is prepared to talk to investors about issues specific to the S upervisory Board . He maintains regular contact between meetings with the Executive Board , and in particular with its chairman , to discuss issues relating in particular to the company \u2019 s strategy , business development , risk situation , risk management and compliance . Composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board comprises 20 members in accordance with the German Co -determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz \u2013 MitbestG ) and the company \u2019 s Articles of Incorporation . Half the members o f the Supervisory Board are elected individually by the shareholders in the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting ( shareholder representa- tives ) , while the other half are elected by the employees of Conti- nental AG and its German subsidiaries ( employee representatives ) . Both the shareholder representatives and the employee represent- atives have an equal duty to act in the interests of the company . The Supervisory Board \u2019 s chairman must be a shareholder repre- sentative . He has the casting vote in the event of a tie . The current Supervisory Board was constituted on April 26 , 2019 . The term of office of the Supervisory Board members lasts until the end of the 2024 Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . The chairman of the Supervisory Board is Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle who , in ac- cordance with the German Corporate Governance Code , is inde- pendent of the company and its Executive Board . The Supervisory Board does not include any members who previously belonged to the Executive Board of Continental AG , who exercise an executive function or advisory role at a major competitor of Continental , or who have a personal relationship with such a competitor . The company has set up an informational program that provides newly elected members of the Supervisory Board with a thorough overview of the c ompany \u2019 s products and technologies as well as finances , controlling and corporate governance at Continental . The Supervisory Board has drawn up its own By -Laws that supple- ment the law and the Articles of Incorporation with more detailed provisions , including provisions on Supervisory Board meetings , the duty of confidentiality , the handling of conflicts of interest and the Executive Board \u2019 s reporting obligations , and a list of transac- tions and measures that require the approval of the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board By -Laws are available on Continen- tal \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board also consults o n a regular basis in the absence of the Executive Board . Before each regular meeting of the Supervisory Board , the representatives of the shareholders and of the employees each meet separately with members of the Exec- utive Board to discuss the upcoming mee ting . The Supervisory Board regularly reviews how effectively it and its committees have fulfilled their responsibilities . It recently carried out such a review in 2021 with the help of an external consultant . This confirmed the Supervisory Board \u2019 s efficie nt and professional approach to its work in the past years . The Supervisory Board has adopted the recommendations that resulted from the 2021 self - assessment and , among other things , resolved to hold an addi- tional regular meeting each fiscal year and to co ordinate more closely with the Executive Board , including outside of meetings . Profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board In accordance with recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code , the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of skills and expertise and specified targets for its composition . The Supervisory Board as a whole should possess the skills and expertise described in more detail below . It is not expected that all Supervisory Board members possess all skills an d expertise . Instead , each area of expertise must be covered by at least one Supervisory Board member . The Supervisory Board assumes that all Supervisory Board members possess the knowledge and skills required for the proper performance of their duties a nd the charac- teristics necessary for successful Supervisory Board work . In partic- ular , these include integrity , commitment , capacity for discussion and teamwork , sufficient availability and discretion . \u203a Internationality : Due to Continental AG \u2019 s global activities , its Supervisory Board requires international professional or business experience . This means professional training or operational activ- ity abroad . International professional and business experience with regard to Asian markets is a lso desirable . \u203a Industry experience : The Supervisory Board should have professional experience in the automotive industry or other in- dustries in which the company operates . In particular , the Super- visory Board wants to increase its expertise in business a reas that are important to the company \u2019 s strategy . Therefore , professional knowledge or experience of information technology , software , telecommunications , mobility services , digital business models or related areas should be available . \u203a Financial expert ise : The Supervisory Board should possess finan- cial knowledge and experience pursuant to Section 100 ( 5 ) AktG as well as recommendation D.3 of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code , i.e . in the areas of accounting , internal control and risk management syste ms , and the audit of financial statements . \u203a Corporate governance and board experience : Members of the Supervisory Board should have experience as a member of the supervisory board or executive board of a German listed com- pany or as a member of such a body o f a foreign listed company . \u203a Sustainability expertise : The Supervisory Board should have in - depth knowledge and experience in the sustainability issues that are relevant to the company . \u203a Organizational and human resources development : The Supervisory Board should have expertise in the area of HR strategy , HR management and labor relations , and in particular knowledge and practical experience in the transformation of companies , including the impact on changing skills requirements for staff . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 18 The Supervisory B oard has specified the following targets for its composition : \u203a The number of members of the Supervisory Board who have the required international experience should at a minimum remain con- stant . Eleven members currently have international experience . \u203a An appropriate number of members with industry experience should be maintained . This applies to 16 of the members . \u203a The Supervisory Board should have an appropriate number of members on the shareholder side whom it deems to be independ- ent in accordance with the G erman Corporate Governance Code . Taking into account the ownership structure , a Supervisory Board member is therefore considered independent if they are independ- ent of the company and its Executive Board , and also independ- ent of a controlling shareholder . The independence of shareholder representatives was assessed in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code by shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board . As part of the assessment of independence from the Executive Board and the company , it was taken into ac- count that four shareholder representatives will have been mem- bers of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years in 2023 . It was also taken i nto consideration in the assessment of independ- ence from any controlling shareholder that two Supervisory Board members are linked to the controlling shareholder , the IHO Group , Herzogenaurach , Germany . As determined in the assess- ment by the shareholder re presentatives on the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board still has an appropriate number of members on the shareholder side who are independent in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code . This assessment is based on the following consid erations : \u203a More than half of the shareholder representatives should be independent of Continental AG and its Executive Board . In the assessment of the independence of the four shareholder repre- sentatives that have been on the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years , given the former and ongoing administration of the members in question , the shareholder representatives over- all see no grounds to accept changing the existing assessment of independence . The shareholder representatives currently on the Supervisory Board are therefore all , without exception , inde- pendent of Continental AG and its Executive Board . \u203a At least five shareholder representatives should be independent of the controlling shareholder , the IHO Group , headquartered in Herzogenaurach , Germany . The shareholder representatives in- dependent of the controlling shareholder are : \u203a Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle \u203a Dorothea von Boxberg ( as of April 29 , 2022 ) \u203a Stefan E. Buchner \u203a Dr. Gunter Dunkel \u203a Satish Khatu \u203a Isabel Corinna Knauf \u203a Sabine Neu\u00df \u203a Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher \u203a In its nominations for election to the Supervisory Board , the Super- visory Board as a rule does not nominate candidates who have al- ready held this position for three full terms of office at the time of the election . \u203a The Supervisory Board has not stipulated an age limit as recom- mended in recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code . It does not consider such a general criterion to be suitable for evaluating the qualifications of a candidate \u2019 s nomina- tion to the Supervisory Boar d. According to Section 96 ( 2 ) AktG , the Supervisory Board of Conti- nental AG is also subject to the requirement that at least 30 % of its members be women and at least 30 % be men . The company re- ports on this on page 22 , in accordance with Section 289f ( 2 ) Nos . 4 to 6 HGB . In its nominations of candidates for election to the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board takes into account the requirements of the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole as well as the aforementioned targets . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 20 Committees of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board currently has five committees with decision - making powers : the Chairman \u2019 s Committee , the Audit Committee , the Nomination Committee , the committee formed in accordance with Section 27 ( 3 ) MitbestG ( the Mediation Committee ) and the committe e for the approval of company transactions with related persons ( Committee for Related Party Transactions ) ( Section 107 ( 3 ) Sentence 4 ; Section 111b ( 1 ) AktG ) . Key responsibilities of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee are preparing the appointment of Executive Board members and concluding , ter- minating and amending their employment contracts and other agreements with them . However , the plenum of the Supervisory Board alone is responsible for establishing the total remun eration of the Executive Board members . Another key responsibility of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee is deciding on the approval of certain trans- actions and measures by the company as specified in the Super- visory Board By -Laws . The Supervisory Board has conferre d some of these participation rights on the Chairman \u2019 s Committee , each member of which may however , in individual cases , demand that a matter again be submitted to the plenary session for decision . The members of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle ( chairman ) ; his vice chairperson , Christiane Benner ; Georg F. W. Schaeffler ; and J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nfelder . The Audit Committee primarily deals with the audit of the ac- counts , the monitoring of the accounting process and the effective- ness of the i nternal control system , the risk management system and the internal audit system , the audit of the financial statements ( including sustainability reporting and examination thereof ) and compliance . In particular , the committee deals with the preliminary examination of Continental AG \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements , and makes its recommenda- tion to the plenary session of the Supervisory Board , which then passes resolutions pursuant to Section 171 AktG . Furthermore , the committee discusses the company \u2019 s draft interim financial reports . It is also responsible for ensuring the necessary independence of the auditor and deals with additional services performed by the auditor . The committee engages the auditor , determines the focus of the report as necessary , negotiates the fee and regularly reviews the quality of the audit . The chairman of the Audit Committee regu- larly consults with the auditor on the progress of the audit and re- ports on this to the committee . The committee al so regularly con- sults with the auditor without the Executive Board . It also gives its recommendation for the Supervisory Board \u2019 s proposal to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting for the election of the auditor . The Audit Committee is also responsible for the preliminary audit of non - financial reporting and for the engagement of an auditor for its re- view , if any . The chairman of the Audit Committee is Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher . He is independent in all respects as defined in the German Corporate Governance Co de . As an auditor with many years of professional experience in management positions , he has in-depth knowledge and experience in auditing . Another commit- tee member , Klaus Rosenfeld , is also a financial expert , and as chief financial officer in a number of companies has in -depth knowledge and experience in accounting and internal control and risk man- agement systems . The other members are Francesco Grioli , Michael Iglhaut , Dirk Nordmann and Georg F. W. Schaeffler . Neither a former Executive Board member nor the chairman of the Supervisory Board may act as chairman of the Audit Committee . The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating suita- ble candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting for election . In addition , the committee must propose targets for the Supervisory Board \u2019 s composition and profile of skills and expertise and review both regularly . The Nomination Committee consists entirely of shareholder representatives , specifi- cally the two members of the Chairm an \u2019 s Committee , Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle ( chairman ) and Georg F. W. Schaeffler ; the chairman of the Audit Committee , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher ; and Isabel Corinna Knauf . In accordance with Section 31 ( 3 ) Sentence 1 MitbestG , the Media- tion Committee becomes active only if the first round of voting on a proposal to appoint a member of the Executive Board or to re- move a member by consent does not achieve the legally required two-thirds majority . This committee must then attempt mediation before a new vote is taken . The members of the Chairman \u2019 s Com- mittee are also the members of the Mediation Committee . The Committee for Related Party Transactions ( RPT Commit- tee ) deals with transactions between Continental AG and a related person , where these t ransactions require the prior consent of Con- tinental AG \u2019 s Supervisory Board in accordance with Sections 111a and 111b AktG . Transactions in this case require the prior consent of the Supervisory Board . In addition to the chairman of the Super- visory Board , Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , and the chairman of the Audit Committee , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher , the Committee for Related Party Transactions includes two further members elected by the Supervisory Board from among the employee representatives where necessary . The Special Emissions Committee and the Special ContiT ech Committee support the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investigations into the manipulation of emission limits by certain automotive manufactur- ers and irregularities in the production of air condition ing lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sec- tor , respectively . In particular , the special committees are available to external law firms as a point of contact , source of information and recipient of reports , regularly rep ort to the plenary session on the investigations and prepare any resolutions required for the ple- nary session or committees . The members of the Special Emissions Committee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , Georg F. W. Schaeffler and Dirk Nordmann . The m embers of the Special ContiTech Com- mittee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher and Dirk Nordmann .

Management , organization and responsibilities Within the Executive Board , the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations ( director of Labor Relations ) and Group Sustaina- bility is responsible for sustainability . Sustainabil ity management within the Continental Group is regulated by a dedicated internal sustainability policy . The Group Sustainability group function is further supplemented by sustainability functions in the group sectors as well as coordina- tors in several business areas and countries . The key sustainability functions were expanded and strengthened in 2022 . The Group Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for as- sessing interdepartmental issues , weighing up risks and opportuni- ties and discus sing relevant Executive Board decisions in advance . In fiscal 2022 , it consisted of the entire Executive Board as well as the heads of the sustainability functions at corporate level and group sector level as well as the heads of other relevant group funct ions . The committee is chaired by the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations ( director of Labor Relations ) and Group Sustaina- bility and managed by the head of the Group Sustainability group function . Some of the group sectors have their own inter depart- mental sustainability committees , which are coordinated by the relevant sustainability functions . The sustainability performance indicators are consolidated in the Continental Group \u2019 s sustainability scorecard , which is approved annually by the Grou p Sustainability Steering Committee on behalf of the Executive Board . The scorecard is based on defined quality criteria for the indicators , is continuously developed further and establishes the formal basis for integrating sustainability into other corporate processes . The topic of sustainability is also an integral part of the Continental Group \u2019 s strategy development . Significant investments must be re- viewed and assessed as to their contribution to sustainability as a standard part of the approval process . For the Autom otive , Tires and ContiTech group sectors , detailed roadmaps for the implementation of sustainability ambitions in the relevant topic areas are under de- velopment . Remuneration The Executive Board and managers are measured against the achievement of sustain ability goals . Long -term remuneration com- ponents ( long -term incentive \u2013 LTI ) are thus linked to sustainability aspects . The LTI plans are updated on an annual basis . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Executi ve Board . Cultural change In order to support cultural change in the organization , we stepped up internal communication with respect to sustainability in fiscal 2022 , held numerous events and further integrated the topic into key internal event formats for managers . These events include the annual Global Sustainability Conference , which is attended by Con- tinental employees from all over the world .

For more information on the circular economy , see the integrated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Responsible value chain Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we strive for 100 % respon- sible sourcing and business partnerships by 2050 at the latest , to- gether with our partners along the value chain . Our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations . Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers , industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks . Concept In the reporting year , a comprehensive management system for ensuring due diligence within a responsible value chain was devel- oped and launched . The global implementation of the system in stages is designed to achieve continuous improvement and to re- spect both human and environmental rights along the value chain . This covers both Continental \u2019 s own operations and in particular those of direct suppliers . For this purpose , responsibilities , rules and processes are clearly defined , including control mechanisms . The management system is guided by specific commitments in the areas of labor standards , occupational health and safety , the environment , safety practices and land rights . The aim of the system is to ensure the corresponding laws are observed and recognized , in particular the requirements under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ) . It is also aimed at system- atically applying due diligence procedures , reducing risks , support- ing the implementation of customer requirements and supplement- ing the existing internal control system . Within the system , our Business Partner Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements , among others for our suppliers , and for their suppliers , including with regard to human rights , working conditions , environmental protection , conflict minerals an d anti- corruption . The Code of Conduct is updated regularly to reflect changes or adjustments to legislation . For suppliers of natural rub- ber , our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber additionally applies . Violations of our rules can be reported via the Integrity Hot- line , which is available around the clock and worldwide . When Continental is notified about violations of our Business Part- ner Code of Conduct , these will be checked , and , if necessary , fur- ther appropriate measures will be initiated n ecessary . Where busi- ness partners are proven to have violated our Business Partner Code of Conduct , Continental requests and monitors remedial measures and reserves the right to terminate the business relation- ship as a last resort . Sustainability aspects a re also taken into consideration at various other points in supplier management . For example , selected suppli- ers are evaluated based on various criteria using self-assessment questionnaires , which we collect via the generally accepted sustain- ability platfo rms for our industries , such as EcoVadis and NQC . These questionnaires are reviewed annually at the corporate level . Furthermore , selective local audits or other audit activities \u2013 such as in relation to the existence of management systems \u2013 are also carried out . We also continue to develop our approach for the responsible value chain in dialog with external stakeholders and support the development of industry -wide standards , for example through our participation in industry dialog with the German governmen t on human rights in the automotive industry . Here , we have worked in particular to cultivate a shared understanding of industry risks and due diligence requirements . We are also involved in initiatives and associations such as econsense , the Responsible B usiness Alliance ( RBA ) and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber ( GPSNR ) . Responsible sourcing is the responsibility of the relevant purchas- ing organizations , which are established at Continental by group sector , product group and country , for example . A corporate pur- chasing network regularly deals with responsible sourcing topi cs as well . The Group Quality group function coordinates the manage- ment of conflict minerals , including the corresponding reporting processes . Results of the concept To further increase transparency and sustainability in Continental \u2019 s natural rubber suppl y chain , the joint venture \u201c Rubberway , \u201d which was founded in 2019 , was rolled out further for the digital risk analy- sis of the upstream supply chain . The joint project with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit ( GIZ ) in the Indone- sian province of West Kalimantan , which has been in place since 2018 , was also further expanded . The aim of the project is to jointly drive forward the implementation of a digital system for the tracea- bility of natural rubber from the project reg ion . By optimizing the supply chain and offering training in the sustainable cultivation of natural rubber , smallholders are supported in boosting the quantity , quality and yield of their produce and in this way improving their income . In addition , a culti vation strategy designed around sustain- ability prevents clearing and deforestation , thereby conserving val- uable resources . As part of a development project with Security Matters ( SMX ) , Continental is working on testing a tamper -proof means of verification of the geographical origin of natural rubber using marker technologies . In fiscal 2022 , field testing was success- fully completed , and the marker substance could be verified beyond doubt throughout the entire tire production process . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 43 As at December 31 , 2022 , 1,009 valid supplier self -assessment questionnaires were available via the two sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC ( PY : 631 ) . This corresponds to a completion rate of 63 % of suppliers selected for this process ( PY : 53 % ) . The increase in the number of available valid supplier self -assessment question- naires and the higher completion rate are due to the onboarding of ContiTech suppliers in EcoVadis and the follow -up activities with suppliers to update and renew their self -assessment questionnaires . Responsible value chain performance indicator 2022 2021 Number of available valid supplier self-assessment questionnaires ( as at December 31 ) 1 1,009 631 1 Based on the self -assessment questionnaires via the sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC completed by suppliers selected for this process . We present further performance indicators for the implementation of a responsible value chain with regard to our own locations in the sections on good working conditions as well as green and safe fac- tories in this combined non -financial statement . For more information on the responsible value chain , see the inte- grated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Good working conditions Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we provide inspiring , healthy and fair working conditions . Concept The Continental Group \u2019 s Code of Conduct sets out the foundation for good working conditions as the basis of our global collabora- tion , including respect for human rights and fair working condi- tions . Employees receive training on compliance with the Code of Conduct . The management system being rolled out for a responsi- ble value chain also includes the company \u2019 s own activities ( see re- sponsible value chain ) . Our HR strategy is geared toward meeting staffing requirements in terms of both quantity and quality . The two HR strategy initiatives \u201c Industrialize Best Fit \u201d and \u201c Enable Transformation \u201d are therefore fo- cused on efficiently and effectively bringing together the right peo- ple and positions and shaping the digital and technological transfor- mation and cultural shift toward new forms of collaboration . Work- force planning , the search for , diagnostic selection and development of talent ( in particular in the areas of software and IT ) , the promotion of employee diversity and lifelong learning , the further development of the management culture and the flexibilization of working hou rs are therefore essential action fields of strategic HR work . We are tackling the impact of our Transformation 2019 \u20132029 structural program , which among other things is associated with the transformation in mobility and is likely to change up to 23,000 jobs worldwide , with targeted training measures for the employees affected . New career prospects and employment opportunities are to be opened up on the internal as well as the external employ- ment markets . Those responsible for HR are the HR functions at Continental Group , group sector , business area and country level , which work together in a global network . A special network of country coordi- nators for labor relations is also part of this organization . We measure the success of HR work against the OUR BA SICS Live Sustainable Engagement index , which is calculated on the basis of the annual employee survey . The index measures employee agree- ment on topics such as whether they personally back the company values and whether they are proud to work for Continent al . Other performance indicators we consult are the sickness rate and the unforced fluctuation rate . The sickness rate measures sickness -re- lated absence relative to contractual work time , and the unforced fluctuation rate measures the voluntary departure o f employees from the company relative to the average number of employees . The OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index has also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board and managers since fiscal 2020 . The sickness rate is also part of this , although only for the plans launched in fiscal 2020 . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . Results of the concept In fiscal 2022 , the Sustainable Engagement in dex was 80 % ( PY : 80 % ) and therefore on par with the previous year . The sickness rate was unchanged at 3.7 % ( PY : 3.7 % ) . For the unforced fluctuation rate , we recorded a slight increase to 7.8 % ( PY : 7.0 % ) . Information about personnel expenses in fiscal 20 22 ( i.e . wages and salaries , social security contributions and pension and post - employment benefit costs ) can be found in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated statement of income in this annual report . Em- ployee benefits such as pensions , post -employmen t benefits and long-term bonus payments are broken down in Note 29 of the notes to the consolidated statement of financial position . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 45 Benchmark in quality Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we are recognized by our customers and society as being a benchmark in quality by ensur- ing safe and sustainable products . Concept The decisi ve factor in becoming a benchmark in quality is a quality - oriented company culture . Our quality policy sets out guidelines for product and process quality at Continental . Product recalls , product liability claims and proceedings as a result of quality defe cts repre- sent a business risk that we want to avoid due to the resulting losses of sales , costs , and loss of customer and market acceptance . For more information , see the report on risks and opportunities in this annual report . Local management systems dr ive forward the implementation of these guidelines . The concrete organizational and technical require- ments can be found in the relevant quality management manuals for the group sectors . The extent of these certifications is assessed on an annual basis as t o how many employees they cover with re- spect to quality management systems . The number of new field quality events is used as an effectiveness indicator for our quality management . A field quality event is a risk -minimizing measure for a product manufactur ed and/or sold by Continental on the basis of a safety-related defect and/or non -compliance with regulations that was initiated by Continental , a customer and/or an authority . The Group Quality group function as well as the quality functions at various lev els in the Continental Group , which work together in a global network , are responsible for the strategic , corporate -wide quality management process . Results of the concept As at December 31 , 2022 , certified quality management systems covered 83 % of our em ployees throughout the Continental Group ( PY : 84 % ) . Thirty new field quality events were identified in fiscal 2022 ( PY : 36 ) .

For more information on benchmark in quality , see the integrated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Sustainable management practice Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we implement effective management processes , fair business practices and responsible cor- porate governance with a balanced view of different perspectives . Concept Group Compliance , which is divided into a central team and regional functions , is responsible for preventing violations in the areas of cor- ruption , antitrust law , money laundering and data protection . This structure is supplemented by compliance coordinators in the coun- tries and at the locations . The fund amental principles of compli- ance management are set out in the Continental Group \u2019 s compli- ance manual . Continental strives for a holistic compliance management system based on a comprehensive analysis of potential compliance risks , followed by the implemen tation of appropriate policies and proce- dures , training , consulting , monitoring and controls that lead to on- going lessons learned and system improvements . The Integrity Hotline and an ombudsman \u2019 s office are on hand to offer support in the detection of vio lations . As a further cornerstone for sustainable management practice , we are committed to promoting employee diversity , which we under- stand as internationality , a balanced gender ratio , and a range of ex- periences and age categories . We have set ourselves the corporate target of increasing the share of female executives and senior exec- utives to 25 % by 2025 and to up to 30 % by 2030 . We intend to achieve this in particular by promoting cultural change in the organization through the expansion of women \u2019 s networks and the holding of diversity workshops and specific events . Gender diversity \u2013 the share of female executives and senior executives \u2013 has also been part of the LTI plans for the mem- bers of the Executive Board and global managers since fiscal 2020 . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . For more information on sustainable management practice and our diversity concept , see the Corporate Governance section of this annual report . For more information on compliance , see the \u201c Struc- ture of the internal control system \u201d section in the report on risks and opportunities . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Report on Risks and Opportunities 88 The overall situation is analyzed and managed corporate -wide using the risk and opportunity management system . The management of Continental is geared toward sustainably in- creasing the value of each individual operating unit . We evaluate risks and opportunities contin ually and responsibly to achieve our goal of adding value . We define risk as the possibility of internal or external events occur- ring that can have a negative influence on the attainment of our strategic and operational targets . As a global corporation , C ontinen- tal is exposed to a number of different risks , in particular due to the transformation in the mobility industry , that could impair business and , in extreme cases , threaten the company \u2019 s existence . At the same time , this transformation also presents opportunities that we intend to consistently seize , as described in the Strategy of the Continental Group section . We accept manageable risks if the re- sulting opportunities are expected to result in sustainable growth in value . We consider growth in value in terms of the Continental Value Contribution ( CVC ) system described in the Corporate Man- agement section . Continental \u2019 s Internal Control System The governance systems at Continental comprise the internal con- trol system , the risk management system and \u2013 as part of the risk management system \u2013 the compliance management system . The risk management system in turn also includes the early risk identifi- cation system in accordance with Section 91 ( 2 ) of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz \u2013 AktG ) . The Executive Board is responsible for the governance systems , which include all subsidiaries . The Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee monitor the effectiveness of these systems . Structure of the internal control system In order to operate successfully as a company in a complex business environment and to ensure the effectiveness , efficiency and propriety of all processes and compliance with the relevant legal and sub -legis- lative regulations , Continental has established an internal control sys- tem that encompasses all relevant business processes . Key elements of the corporate -wide internal control system are the clear allocation of responsibilities and system -inherent controls in the respective process flows . The two -person rule and separation of functions are fundamental principles of this organization . Continen- tal \u2019 s management also issues guidelines to ensure that all business processes are conducted in an economical , orderly and legally compliant manner . Based on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable guidelines , the internal control system at Continental follows the Three Lines Model . In the first line , system-inherent controls are configured in the company \u2019 s IT systems to support the orderly and economical exe- cution of all process flow transactions in accordance with the cor- porate-wide guidelines . At the same time , these transactional con- trols help to identify risks and deviations that require separate con- sideration . As the controls and process flows established in the first line apply to Continental \u2019 s operating business , they are generally put in place at the level of our operating units , such as our subsidi- aries , business areas and group sectors . In the second line of our internal control system , guidelines for process flows are developed , implemented and updated and com- pliance with controls and guidelines is monitored . Responsibility for this lies primarily with the group functions , in addition to the busi- ness areas and group sectors . The responsibilities include , for ex- ample , the risk management system and the compliance manage- ment system . In order to perform this superv isory and monitoring function , an integrated reporting system has been established that includes , for example , the financial reporting internal control sys- tem ( Financial Reporting ICS ) , the general risk management sys- tem , the compliance risk management sys tem and the tax compli- ance management system . The supervisory and monitoring func- tion is performed on the basis of regular reports and supplemented as needed with effectiveness tests as part of self -audits and regular internal and external reviews . The com pliance management system plays an important role within the second line of defense by helping to prevent , detect and respond to compliance violations . The Group Compliance group function is responsible for the compliance management system . The chief compl iance officer reports directly to the chairman of the Executive Board . The work done by Group Compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting corruption , fraud and other property offenses , violations of antitrust and competition law and money launder ing ; implementing data protection ; and responding to compliance violations . For other legal areas in which there is a risk of compliance violations , responsibility for appropriate and effective compliance management lies with the respective functions , whic h are supported in these tasks by Group Compliance . An effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention . It be- gins with setting an appropriate \u201c tone from the top \u201d by the Executive Board and management and , in addition to risk analysis , includes in particular employee training , compliance consulting and the inter- nal publication of guidelines . In the course of risk analysis , the business activities of Continental are examined for compliance risks within the scope of top -down as Report on Risks and Opportunities Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Report on Risks and Opportunities 89 well as bottom -up review processes . The risk of compliance viola- tions arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows , the given market situation and activities in certain geographical re- gions . Furthermore , findings from investigations by the Group Inter- nal Audit group function as well as discussions with management and employees at all hierarchical levels are taken into account . This risk analysis is not a one -off procedure , but is performed annually and continuously updated . Prevention is also fostered by cons ultation on specific matters with Group Compliance and by the internal publication of guidelines on topics such as anti -corruption ( including giving and receiving gifts as well as donations and sponsoring ) , antitrust and competition law , anti-money launder ing and data protection . In training events , Group Compliance addresses topics directly related to everyday compli- ance issues and challenges . Continental introduced the Business Partner Code of Conduct to prevent compliance violations by suppliers , service providers , rep- resentatives or similar third parties . This must be recognized as a basic requirement for doing business with Continental . In the context of detection , Continental has set up an Integrity Hot- line to give employees and third parties outside t he Continental Group the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations , its fundamental values and ethical standards . Information on any kind of potential violations , including accounting manipulation , can be reported anonymously via this hotline . The hotline is available world- wide in many different languages . The company \u2019 s investigating units rigorously pursue any and all substantiated leads . Detection also includes the support of regular and incident -related audits conducted by Group Internal Aud it . Compliance -related is- sues are regularly the subject of audits by Group Internal Audit . Responses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence of identified compliance violations . Group Compliance is involved in decision-making on measures that m ay be required , including thor- ough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms of failings in the system . In this way , corresponding gaps can be closed preventively and the compliance management system , as well as the internal control syste m , can be systematically developed . The third line of our internal control system is our Group Internal Audit group function . Group Internal Audit serves an independent and objective auditing and advisory function , applying a systematic approach to help r e- view , assess and improve the adequacy and effectiveness of the or- ganization \u2019 s governance systems . Continental \u2019 s Executive Board au- thorizes Group Internal Audit to conduct audits in all regions , com- panies or functions of Continental AG and its affiliated , fully consoli- dated subsidiaries worldwide . Group Internal Audit prepares an annual risk -oriented audit plan that is submitted to Continental \u2019 s Executive Board for review and approval . In addition to its planned general audits , Group Internal Audit also co nducts special investigations . These are based on tips and information about fraudulent acts received from internal or external sources such as the Integrity Hotline or the ombudsman \u2019 s office . Group Internal Audit regularly reports its audit and investiga tion re- sults to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee . Significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies . The imple- mentation by management of the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and re- ported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee . Appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system The three -tier structure of the internal control system at Cont inen- tal and the associated guidelines and processes introduced world- wide fundamentally ensure that the relevant business processes are performed properly , economically and in compliance with legal regulations . Nevertheless , an internal control system canno t pro- vide complete protection , particularly if internal controls and guide- lines are intentionally circumvented . To proactively prevent and de- tect such circumvention , Continental has established monitoring functions at the various levels of the internal con trol system . Group Internal Audit assumes a particularly important role in this regard . Internal monitoring of compliance with internal controls is supple- mented by information we receive from external audits , for exam- ple as part of ISO certifications , cust omer and supplier audits , com- pany audits , customs audits and IT audits . These findings are taken into account when updating and making necessary adjustments to our internal control system . Continental \u2019 s Executive Board is kept continuously informed of the results of internal audit activities , external audits and governance system reporting , all of which form the basis for the Executive Board \u2019 s assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system . The increased volatility of our business environment , the transfor- mation of the automotive industry , the ever faster pace of techno- logical development and the necessary consideration of sustaina- bility aspects have shown that an internal control system must be continuously adapted"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short,precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

We closely supervised , carefu lly monitored and advised the Executive Board in the management of the company . We were directly involved in a timely manner in all decisions of fun- damental importance to the company . The Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular , timely and comprehensive updates at its meetings as well as ver- bally and in writing on all issues of relevance to the company . In particular , these include the business performance , business strat- egy , planning , significant business transactions in the company an d the Continental Group , and the related risks and opportunities , as well as compliance issues . The members of the Supervisory Board were also available to the Executive Board for consultation outside the meetings . As chairman of the Supervisory Board , I h ad regular contact with the members of the Executive Board , in particular with its chairman , and discussed current company issues and develop- ments with them . Pursuant to a suggestion of the German Corpo- rate Governance Code , I also held discussions with inv estors in 2022 on topics specific to the Supervisory Board . Meetings of the Supervisory Board and the committees Meetings of the Supervisory Board took place both virtually and in person in fiscal 2022 . In total , the Supervisory Board convened for five ordinary meetings and one extraordinary meeting in 2022 , as well as for the strategy meeting . The September and December meetings and the strategy meeting were held in person , while the other meetings took place virtually . At its meetings , the Supervisory Board regularly conferred part of the time in the absence of the Executive Board . In addition to these meetings , the Supervisory Board passed two resolutions by written procedure , one of which was passed only by the shareholder representatives . The Chairman \u2019 s Committee held two meetings in the reporting year ( one virtually and one in person ) and passed two resolutions by written procedure . The Audit Committee met four times virtually in 2022 and passed one resolution by written procedure . The Nomi- nation Comm ittee passed one resolution by written procedure and also prepared the appointment of a new member to the Supervisory Board and the revision of its profile of skills and expertise . The Me- diation Committee in accordance with Section 27 ( 3 ) of the German Co-determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz \u2013 MitbestG ) was not required to meet in 2022 , and neither was the Committee for Re- lated Party Transactions ( RPT Committee ) . The special committee formed in connection with the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investigation into t he manipulation of emission limits by certain automotive manufacturers ( Special Emissions Committee ) met twice in the year under review . At its December meeting , the Supervisory Board additionally formed a further special committee to support the Superviso ry Board \u2019 s investigation into irregularities in the production of air conditioning lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector ( Special Conti - Tech Committee ) . The Special ContiTech Committee did not hold any meetings in the year under review . There are no other committees . All committees report to the plenary session . The corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetz - buch \u2013 HGB ) starting on page 15 describes their responsibilities in more detail and names their members .

Schaeffler 1 / 2 50 Key topics dealt with by the Supervisory Board and the Chairman \u2019 s Committee At each ordinary meeting of the plenary session , the Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board in detail of the sales , results and employment development in the Continental Gr oup and indi- vidual group sectors as well as the financial situation of the com- pany . Where the actual course of business deviated from the de- fined plans and targets , the Executive Board provided detailed expla- nations . It discussed the reasons for these devi ations and the measures introduced in depth with the Supervisory Board . In addi- tion , the Executive Board regularly informed us about the Continen- tal Group \u2019 s main raw materials and sales markets and about Conti- nental AG \u2019 s share price performance . As part of this regular report- ing , the Executive Board also went into detail on the impact of the war in Ukraine on the company . In addition , the work of the Supervisory Board and its collaboration with the Executive Board in the year under review continued to be shaped by the transformation process in the automotive industry and its consequences for the company . Another focus of the Super- visory Board \u2019 s work was again on the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investiga- tion into the manipulation of emission limits in vehicles of spe cific automotive manufacturers , including monitoring of the correspond- ing investigative proceedings by public prosecutors . The Supervisory Board discussed this at each ordinary meeting . The Special Emis- sions Committee formed in connection with this matter also met twice in 2022 . Finally , the Supervisory Board addressed cybersecu- rity and the cyberattack on Continental in detail , as well as the irreg- ularities in the production of air conditioning lines and indus trial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector . At the meeting on March 17 , 2022 , we discussed and subse- quently approved the company \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2021 . We also approved both the decision by the Executive Board to hold the 2022 Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting virtually and the draft agenda for the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting , and resolved the proposed resolutions of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . In addition , we discussed the acquisition of US conveyor belt manufacturer WCCO Belting , LLC , Wilmington , Delaware , USA , by the ContiTech group sector and the sale of a product line from the Automotive group sector . Measures from the Supervisory Board \u2019 s self-assessment in 2021 were also discussed at the meeting , and we resolved to implement the proposed improvement measures . These include , for example , establishing a further regular plenary meeting per fiscal year . We also passed a resolution on the approval in principle of the reassignment of 24.9 % of the shares in ContiTech AG , Hanover , from Continental Pension Trust e. V. , Hanover , to the Continental Group . Final approval on this reassignment was resolved by written procedure at the end of May on the recomme ndation of the Audit Committee . In addition , we resolved to update the declaration in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktien - gesetz \u2013 AktG ) on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code , since the circums tances that required a change to the declaration in connection with the spin -off of Vitesco Tech- nologies Group AG in September 2021 no longer appl ied . At the Supervisory Board meeting on April 29 , 2022 , in addition to the ongoing business development , we also discussed in depth the Continental Group \u2019 s business activities in Russia , particularly with respect to the Tires group sector . We also received reports from the Executive Board on how the company is responding to supply shortages and price increases in the supply of energy . In implementing concrete measures following the Supervisory Board \u2019 s self -assessment , an additional ordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board was held for the first time on June 23 , 2022 . The transformation process in the automotive industry was an important topic of discussion at this meeting . In addition , the head of Compliance reported on the future organizational structure for compliance , and the Executive Board provided an update on the Continental Group \u2019 s current insurance sit uation . At the full -day strategy meeting held on September 21 , 2022 , the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board once again dis- cussed in detail the strategic objectives and strategic planning of the Continental Group , the Automotive group sector ( with a focus on the Autonomous Mobility business area ) and the Tires and Con ti- Tech group sectors , the Continental Group \u2019 s sustainability require- ments and the HR strategy . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 13 action . The Supervisory Board also resolved that a further special committee ( the Special ContiTech Committee ) would support this investigation . The Chairman \u2019 s Committee held two meetings in the year under review , in which it primarily prepared the personnel -related decisions of the plenary session and mad e recommendations for resolutions . At the first meeting on March 17 , 2022 , this included the recom- mendation on determined performance bonuses for fiscal 2021 , which the plenary session resolved at its following meeting . At the second meeting on December 14 , 2022 , the Chairman \u2019 s Commit- tee resolved proposals to the Chairman \u2019 s Committee relating to tar- gets set for the variable remuneration of the Executive Board and to the creation of a new Executive Board function for Integrity and Law . At the end of May , the Chairman \u2019 s Committee also approved the acquisition of US conveyor belt manufacturer WCCO Belting , LLC , Wilmington , Delaware , USA , by written procedure . This acquisi- tion had previously been discussed at the meeting of the plenary session on March 17 , 2022 . In September , the Chairman \u2019 s Commit- tee approved an investment project of the Automotive group sector by written procedure . Key topics dealt with by the Audit Committee The Audit Committee was also informed by the Executive Board in detail and on an ongoi ng basis about sales , results and employment development in the Continental Group and individual group sectors as well as the financial situation of the company . The Executive Board is assisted by the head of Accounting and the head of Group Controlling , w ho attend the meetings of the Audit Committee and can thereby provide information directly . In addition , the chairman of the Audit Committee is in regular contact with the chief financial officer and the auditor of the Continental Group outside of meetings and has access to senior employees entrusted with tasks relating to accounting , the internal control system , the risk management sys- tem , internal auditing and compliance . The chairman of the Audit Committee shares key information with the Audit Committee . As a focus of each of its quarterly meetings , the Audit Committee talks with the Executive Board about the accounting as at the end of the previous quarter and the outlook for the year as a whole as well as the quarterly statements and the half -year fina ncial report prior to their publication . Another focus of the Audit Committee \u2019 s work in the past fiscal year was dealing with the company \u2019 s internal control system and risk management system . At its meeting on March 2 , 2022 , the Audit Committee discussed the company \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the combined non -financial state- ment for 2021 with the Executive Board and the auditor , and rec- ommended their approval to the pl enary session of the Supervisory Board . The interim financial statements as at June 30 , 2022 , were reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs - gesellschaft , Hanover branch ( PwC ) , on behalf of the Audit Commit- tee . The work of the Group Compl iance and Group Internal Audit group functions and reporting on significant risks and incidents are also regular topics at each meeting . This includes in particular the matters described in more detail in the report on risks and opportu- nities and in the no tes to the consolidated financial statements . In addition to these recurring topics , at its meeting on May 4 , 2022 , the Audit Committee discussed the reassignment of 24.9 % of the shares in ContiTech AG , Hanover , from Continental Pension Trust e. V. , Hanov er , to the Continental Group , and was updated on the current status of cybersecurity . At the meeting on August 2 , 2022 , acquisition controlling was treated as a special topic of dis- cussion . The Audit Committee also addressed the review of the interim financial statements by auditor PwC at this meeting . In the absence of the Executive Board , the committee discussed with PwC the focal points to be determined in the audit by the Supervisory Board . At the meeting on November 9 , 2022 , the Audit Committee issued the mandate for the audit of the 2022 annual and consoli- dated financial statements , including the combined non -financial statement , the report on relations with affiliated companies and the remuneration report , to the auditor appointed by the Annual Share- holders \u2019 Meeting , PwC . In addition , the Audit Committee defined an approval framework for commissioning the auditor with permissi- ble non-audit services in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation . The Executive Board regularly informs the Audit Committee abo ut the use of this authorization . The Audit Committee discussed the current status of the cyberattack and initial consequences with the Executive Board and addressed the status of implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensor gfalts - pflichtengesetz ) . The perception of Continental on the capital mar- ket was also discussed . Finally , the Audit Committee extensively ad- dressed the irregularities in the production of air -conditioning lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sector and received reports on the current situation . Corporate governance At its meetings on March 17 , 2022 , and December 14 , 2022 , the Supervisory Board agreed to an updated declaration in accordance with Section 161 AktG on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code . At its meeting on September 22 , 2022 , the Supervisory Board approved amendments to the By -Laws of the Supervisory Board and to the By -Laws of the Audit Committee , prompted as a result of the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code . At its meeting on December 14 , 2022 , the Super- visory Board decided on amendments to its profile of skills and ex- pertise , and passed a resolution on the corresponding skills matrix . The chairman of the S upervisory Board was notified of potential conflicts of interest by three Supervisory Board members in 2022 . In such cases , it is ensured that the Supervisory Board members in question do not participate in discussions of the Supervisory Board and its comm ittees on the topics that could constitute a conflict of interest and also do not receive any information in this regard . These are not significant and long -term conflicts of interest that would require the members to step down . In its opinion , the Super- visory Board also had an appropriate number of independent members , in particular on the shareholder side , as defined in the Code at all times in the period under review . Further information on this topic and on corporate governance in general is included in the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB ( starting on page 15 ) . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 15 Responsible corporate governance is what governs the actions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board . Good , responsible corporate governance geared toward sustainable , long-term value creation and in the interests of all stakeholder groups is what governs the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Continental AG . The following corporate governance state- ment pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commer- cial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch \u2013 HGB ) is representative of corporate governance at Continental and is a part of the management report . The remuneration report for fiscal 2022 on the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board together with the auditor \u2019 s report and the valid remuneration system for the remu- neration of the Executive Board are available on Continental \u2019 s web- site under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . The valid remuneration system for remuneration of the Supervisory Board is described in the remuneration repor t for fiscal 2022 and is available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board . Declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the G erman Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz \u2013 AktG ) and deviations from the German Corporate Governance Code ( Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex \u2013 DCGK ) In December 2022 , the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board issued the following annual declaration pursuant to Section 161 AktG : \u201c The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Continental AG declare in accordance with Section 161 German Stock Corpora- tions Act ( AktG ) that the recommendations of the \u2018 Government Commission on the German Cor porate Governance Code \u2019 in the version dated December 16 , 2019 ( published by the Federal Minis- try of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on March 20 , 2020 ) , were complied with since February 18 , 2022 , with the exception as set out below , and fur- ther the recommendations of the \u2018 Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code \u2019 in the version dated April 28 , 2022 ( published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on June 27 , 2022 ) have been complied with and will continue to be complied with , with the exception set out below . Reference is made to the declaration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of March 2022 as well as to previous decla- rations in accordance with Section 161 AktG and the deviations from the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code explained therein . According to recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code , the Supervisory Board shall set an age limit for members of the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board does not set an age limit because it does not consider such a general criterion to be appropriate for evaluating the qualifications of a Supervisory Board member . Hanover , December 2022 Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle Chairman of the Supervisory Board Nikolai Setzer Chairman of the Executive Board \u201d The declaration of compliance is published in the Company/Corpo- rate Governance section of Continental \u2019 s website . Earlier declara- tions pursuant to Section 161 AktG can also be found there . Out -of- date corporate governance statements can also be found there for a period of at least five years from the date they were issued . Key corporate governance practices The following documents are key foundations of our sustaina ble and responsible corporate governance : \u203a OUR BASICS \u2013 Continental AG \u2019 s corporate guidelines . The vision , mission and values , desired behavior and self -image of the Conti- nental Group ; available on Continental \u2019 s website under Com- pany/Corporate Governance/Vision & Mission . \u203a Sustainability ambition ; available on Continental \u2019 s website under Sustainability /Sustainabi lity Framework/Continental \u2019 s Sustainability Ambition . \u203a Compliance with the binding Code of Conduct for all Continental employees . For more information , see Continental \u2019 s website under Sustainability /Sustainable Corporate Governance/ Organi- zation and Management . Corporate bodies In line with the law and the Articles of Incorporation , the company \u2019 s corporate bodies are the Executive Board , the Supervisory Board and the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . As a German stock corporation , Continental AG has a dual management system characterized by a strict personnel d ivision between the Executive Board as the man- agement body and the Supervisory Board as the monitoring body . The cooperation between the Executive Board , Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Meeting is depicted on the next page . The Executive Board and its practices The Executive Board has sole responsibility for managing the com- pany in the interests of the company , free from instructions from third parties in accordance with the law , the Articles of Incorpora- tion and the Executive Board \u2019 s By -Laws , while taking into account the resolutions of the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . All members of the Executive Board share responsibility for the management of the company jointly . Regardless of this principle of joint responsibility , each Executive Board member is individually responsible for the areas entrusted to them . The chairman of the Executive Board is responsible for the company \u2019 s overall management and business policy . He ensures management coordination and uniformity on the Executive Board and represents the company to the public . The Executive Board jointly develops the company \u2019 s strategy , agrees it with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation . Corporate Governance Statement Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 16 The Executive Board had five members as at December 31 , 2022 , and as at the date of this statement . Information on areas of respon- sibility and resumes of the Executive Board members are available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Govern- ance/Executive Board . From May 1 , 2023 , the Executive Board will be expanded to six members following the Supervisory Board \u2019 s de- cision to create a new Executive Board function for Integrity and Law on December 14 , 2022 ( for details , see the report of the Super - visory Board , page 12 ) . The first time a person is appointed to the Executive Board , his or her term as a rule is three years only . As a rule , a member of the Executive Board is not appointed beyond the statutory retirement age . Only under exceptional circumstances will a member of the Execu- tive Board be reappoint ed earlier than one year prior to the end of their term of appointment with simultaneous annulment of their current appointment . More information on the members of the Executive Board and their memberships to be disclosed pursuant to Section 285 No . 10 HGB can be found on page 219 and on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/ Executive Board . The Executive Board has By -Laws that regulate in particular the allocation of duties among the Executive Board members , key matters pertaining to the company and its subsidiaries that require a decision to be made by the Executive Board , the duties of th e Executive Board chairman , and the process in which the Executive Board passes resolutions . The Executive Board By -Laws are availa- ble on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Govern- ance/Executive Board . The Supervisory Board By -Laws on the basis of the Articles of Incorporation require the consent of the Super- visory Board for significant actions taken by management . The Executive Board has established separate boards for the Auto- motive , Tires and ContiTech group sectors . This measure supports the decentralization of responsibility that the global o rganization of the company seeks to achieve , and relieves the burden on the Continental Group Executive Board . In addition to establishing these boards , the Executive Board has delegated to them decision -mak- ing powers for certain matters that affect only the relevant group sectors . The boards for the three group sectors each comprise the Executive Board member responsible for the group sector in question as their chairman , the heads of the relevant business areas within the group sector , as well as furthe r members from among the central functions of the relevant group sectors . The Supervisory Board and its practices The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive Board and collaborates with the Executive Board to develop a long - term succession plan . The Supervisory Board discusses this at least once a year without the Executive Board . In order to become ac- quainted with potential successors , the Supervisory Board , in con- sultation with the Executive Board , offers them the opportunity to deliver presentations to the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in managing the company . This includes , in particular , issues relating to the company \u2019 s strategy , planning , business development , risk sit- uation , risk management , compliance and sustainability . The Super- visory Board is directly involved in decisions of material importance Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 17 to the company . As specified by law , the Articles of Incorporation or the Supervisory Board By -Laws , certain corporate mana gement matters require the approval of the Supervisory Board . The chair- man of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and represents it vis-\u00e0-vis third parties . Within reasonable limits , he is prepared to talk to investors about issues specific to the S upervisory Board . He maintains regular contact between meetings with the Executive Board , and in particular with its chairman , to discuss issues relating in particular to the company \u2019 s strategy , business development , risk situation , risk management and compliance . Composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board comprises 20 members in accordance with the German Co -determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz \u2013 MitbestG ) and the company \u2019 s Articles of Incorporation . Half the members o f the Supervisory Board are elected individually by the shareholders in the Shareholders \u2019 Meeting ( shareholder representa- tives ) , while the other half are elected by the employees of Conti- nental AG and its German subsidiaries ( employee representatives ) . Both the shareholder representatives and the employee represent- atives have an equal duty to act in the interests of the company . The Supervisory Board \u2019 s chairman must be a shareholder repre- sentative . He has the casting vote in the event of a tie . The current Supervisory Board was constituted on April 26 , 2019 . The term of office of the Supervisory Board members lasts until the end of the 2024 Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting . The chairman of the Supervisory Board is Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle who , in ac- cordance with the German Corporate Governance Code , is inde- pendent of the company and its Executive Board . The Supervisory Board does not include any members who previously belonged to the Executive Board of Continental AG , who exercise an executive function or advisory role at a major competitor of Continental , or who have a personal relationship with such a competitor . The company has set up an informational program that provides newly elected members of the Supervisory Board with a thorough overview of the c ompany \u2019 s products and technologies as well as finances , controlling and corporate governance at Continental . The Supervisory Board has drawn up its own By -Laws that supple- ment the law and the Articles of Incorporation with more detailed provisions , including provisions on Supervisory Board meetings , the duty of confidentiality , the handling of conflicts of interest and the Executive Board \u2019 s reporting obligations , and a list of transac- tions and measures that require the approval of the Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board By -Laws are available on Continen- tal \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board . The Supervisory Board also consults o n a regular basis in the absence of the Executive Board . Before each regular meeting of the Supervisory Board , the representatives of the shareholders and of the employees each meet separately with members of the Exec- utive Board to discuss the upcoming mee ting . The Supervisory Board regularly reviews how effectively it and its committees have fulfilled their responsibilities . It recently carried out such a review in 2021 with the help of an external consultant . This confirmed the Supervisory Board \u2019 s efficie nt and professional approach to its work in the past years . The Supervisory Board has adopted the recommendations that resulted from the 2021 self - assessment and , among other things , resolved to hold an addi- tional regular meeting each fiscal year and to co ordinate more closely with the Executive Board , including outside of meetings . Profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board In accordance with recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code , the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of skills and expertise and specified targets for its composition . The Supervisory Board as a whole should possess the skills and expertise described in more detail below . It is not expected that all Supervisory Board members possess all skills an d expertise . Instead , each area of expertise must be covered by at least one Supervisory Board member . The Supervisory Board assumes that all Supervisory Board members possess the knowledge and skills required for the proper performance of their duties a nd the charac- teristics necessary for successful Supervisory Board work . In partic- ular , these include integrity , commitment , capacity for discussion and teamwork , sufficient availability and discretion . \u203a Internationality : Due to Continental AG \u2019 s global activities , its Supervisory Board requires international professional or business experience . This means professional training or operational activ- ity abroad . International professional and business experience with regard to Asian markets is a lso desirable . \u203a Industry experience : The Supervisory Board should have professional experience in the automotive industry or other in- dustries in which the company operates . In particular , the Super- visory Board wants to increase its expertise in business a reas that are important to the company \u2019 s strategy . Therefore , professional knowledge or experience of information technology , software , telecommunications , mobility services , digital business models or related areas should be available . \u203a Financial expert ise : The Supervisory Board should possess finan- cial knowledge and experience pursuant to Section 100 ( 5 ) AktG as well as recommendation D.3 of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code , i.e . in the areas of accounting , internal control and risk management syste ms , and the audit of financial statements . \u203a Corporate governance and board experience : Members of the Supervisory Board should have experience as a member of the supervisory board or executive board of a German listed com- pany or as a member of such a body o f a foreign listed company . \u203a Sustainability expertise : The Supervisory Board should have in - depth knowledge and experience in the sustainability issues that are relevant to the company . \u203a Organizational and human resources development : The Supervisory Board should have expertise in the area of HR strategy , HR management and labor relations , and in particular knowledge and practical experience in the transformation of companies , including the impact on changing skills requirements for staff . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 18 The Supervisory B oard has specified the following targets for its composition : \u203a The number of members of the Supervisory Board who have the required international experience should at a minimum remain con- stant . Eleven members currently have international experience . \u203a An appropriate number of members with industry experience should be maintained . This applies to 16 of the members . \u203a The Supervisory Board should have an appropriate number of members on the shareholder side whom it deems to be independ- ent in accordance with the G erman Corporate Governance Code . Taking into account the ownership structure , a Supervisory Board member is therefore considered independent if they are independ- ent of the company and its Executive Board , and also independ- ent of a controlling shareholder . The independence of shareholder representatives was assessed in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code by shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board . As part of the assessment of independence from the Executive Board and the company , it was taken into ac- count that four shareholder representatives will have been mem- bers of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years in 2023 . It was also taken i nto consideration in the assessment of independ- ence from any controlling shareholder that two Supervisory Board members are linked to the controlling shareholder , the IHO Group , Herzogenaurach , Germany . As determined in the assess- ment by the shareholder re presentatives on the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board still has an appropriate number of members on the shareholder side who are independent in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code . This assessment is based on the following consid erations : \u203a More than half of the shareholder representatives should be independent of Continental AG and its Executive Board . In the assessment of the independence of the four shareholder repre- sentatives that have been on the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years , given the former and ongoing administration of the members in question , the shareholder representatives over- all see no grounds to accept changing the existing assessment of independence . The shareholder representatives currently on the Supervisory Board are therefore all , without exception , inde- pendent of Continental AG and its Executive Board . \u203a At least five shareholder representatives should be independent of the controlling shareholder , the IHO Group , headquartered in Herzogenaurach , Germany . The shareholder representatives in- dependent of the controlling shareholder are : \u203a Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle \u203a Dorothea von Boxberg ( as of April 29 , 2022 ) \u203a Stefan E. Buchner \u203a Dr. Gunter Dunkel \u203a Satish Khatu \u203a Isabel Corinna Knauf \u203a Sabine Neu\u00df \u203a Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher \u203a In its nominations for election to the Supervisory Board , the Super- visory Board as a rule does not nominate candidates who have al- ready held this position for three full terms of office at the time of the election . \u203a The Supervisory Board has not stipulated an age limit as recom- mended in recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code . It does not consider such a general criterion to be suitable for evaluating the qualifications of a candidate \u2019 s nomina- tion to the Supervisory Boar d. According to Section 96 ( 2 ) AktG , the Supervisory Board of Conti- nental AG is also subject to the requirement that at least 30 % of its members be women and at least 30 % be men . The company re- ports on this on page 22 , in accordance with Section 289f ( 2 ) Nos . 4 to 6 HGB . In its nominations of candidates for election to the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board takes into account the requirements of the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole as well as the aforementioned targets . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report To O ur Sharehold ers Corporate Governance 20 Committees of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board currently has five committees with decision - making powers : the Chairman \u2019 s Committee , the Audit Committee , the Nomination Committee , the committee formed in accordance with Section 27 ( 3 ) MitbestG ( the Mediation Committee ) and the committe e for the approval of company transactions with related persons ( Committee for Related Party Transactions ) ( Section 107 ( 3 ) Sentence 4 ; Section 111b ( 1 ) AktG ) . Key responsibilities of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee are preparing the appointment of Executive Board members and concluding , ter- minating and amending their employment contracts and other agreements with them . However , the plenum of the Supervisory Board alone is responsible for establishing the total remun eration of the Executive Board members . Another key responsibility of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee is deciding on the approval of certain trans- actions and measures by the company as specified in the Super- visory Board By -Laws . The Supervisory Board has conferre d some of these participation rights on the Chairman \u2019 s Committee , each member of which may however , in individual cases , demand that a matter again be submitted to the plenary session for decision . The members of the Chairman \u2019 s Committee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle ( chairman ) ; his vice chairperson , Christiane Benner ; Georg F. W. Schaeffler ; and J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nfelder . The Audit Committee primarily deals with the audit of the ac- counts , the monitoring of the accounting process and the effective- ness of the i nternal control system , the risk management system and the internal audit system , the audit of the financial statements ( including sustainability reporting and examination thereof ) and compliance . In particular , the committee deals with the preliminary examination of Continental AG \u2019 s annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements , and makes its recommenda- tion to the plenary session of the Supervisory Board , which then passes resolutions pursuant to Section 171 AktG . Furthermore , the committee discusses the company \u2019 s draft interim financial reports . It is also responsible for ensuring the necessary independence of the auditor and deals with additional services performed by the auditor . The committee engages the auditor , determines the focus of the report as necessary , negotiates the fee and regularly reviews the quality of the audit . The chairman of the Audit Committee regu- larly consults with the auditor on the progress of the audit and re- ports on this to the committee . The committee al so regularly con- sults with the auditor without the Executive Board . It also gives its recommendation for the Supervisory Board \u2019 s proposal to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting for the election of the auditor . The Audit Committee is also responsible for the preliminary audit of non - financial reporting and for the engagement of an auditor for its re- view , if any . The chairman of the Audit Committee is Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher . He is independent in all respects as defined in the German Corporate Governance Co de . As an auditor with many years of professional experience in management positions , he has in-depth knowledge and experience in auditing . Another commit- tee member , Klaus Rosenfeld , is also a financial expert , and as chief financial officer in a number of companies has in -depth knowledge and experience in accounting and internal control and risk man- agement systems . The other members are Francesco Grioli , Michael Iglhaut , Dirk Nordmann and Georg F. W. Schaeffler . Neither a former Executive Board member nor the chairman of the Supervisory Board may act as chairman of the Audit Committee . The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating suita- ble candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting for election . In addition , the committee must propose targets for the Supervisory Board \u2019 s composition and profile of skills and expertise and review both regularly . The Nomination Committee consists entirely of shareholder representatives , specifi- cally the two members of the Chairm an \u2019 s Committee , Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle ( chairman ) and Georg F. W. Schaeffler ; the chairman of the Audit Committee , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher ; and Isabel Corinna Knauf . In accordance with Section 31 ( 3 ) Sentence 1 MitbestG , the Media- tion Committee becomes active only if the first round of voting on a proposal to appoint a member of the Executive Board or to re- move a member by consent does not achieve the legally required two-thirds majority . This committee must then attempt mediation before a new vote is taken . The members of the Chairman \u2019 s Com- mittee are also the members of the Mediation Committee . The Committee for Related Party Transactions ( RPT Commit- tee ) deals with transactions between Continental AG and a related person , where these t ransactions require the prior consent of Con- tinental AG \u2019 s Supervisory Board in accordance with Sections 111a and 111b AktG . Transactions in this case require the prior consent of the Supervisory Board . In addition to the chairman of the Super- visory Board , Prof. Dr.-Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , and the chairman of the Audit Committee , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher , the Committee for Related Party Transactions includes two further members elected by the Supervisory Board from among the employee representatives where necessary . The Special Emissions Committee and the Special ContiT ech Committee support the Supervisory Board \u2019 s investigations into the manipulation of emission limits by certain automotive manufactur- ers and irregularities in the production of air condition ing lines and industrial hoses in two business areas of the ContiTech group sec- tor , respectively . In particular , the special committees are available to external law firms as a point of contact , source of information and recipient of reports , regularly rep ort to the plenary session on the investigations and prepare any resolutions required for the ple- nary session or committees . The members of the Special Emissions Committee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , Georg F. W. Schaeffler and Dirk Nordmann . The m embers of the Special ContiTech Com- mittee are Prof. Dr. -Ing . Wolfgang Reitzle , Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher and Dirk Nordmann . Finally , the Supervisory Board has formed a group of experts that deals with sustainability issues relevant to Continental . The gr oup of experts comprises two shareholder representatives and two employee representatives . More information on the members of the Supervisory Board and its committees can be found on pages 220 and 221 . Current resumes , which are updated annually , are available on Continental \u2019 s website under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board They also contain information on how long each member has held their position on the Supervisory Board .

Management , organization and responsibilities Within the Executive Board , the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations ( director of Labor Relations ) and Group Sustaina- bility is responsible for sustainability . Sustainabil ity management within the Continental Group is regulated by a dedicated internal sustainability policy . The Group Sustainability group function is further supplemented by sustainability functions in the group sectors as well as coordina- tors in several business areas and countries . The key sustainability functions were expanded and strengthened in 2022 . The Group Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for as- sessing interdepartmental issues , weighing up risks and opportuni- ties and discus sing relevant Executive Board decisions in advance . In fiscal 2022 , it consisted of the entire Executive Board as well as the heads of the sustainability functions at corporate level and group sector level as well as the heads of other relevant group funct ions . The committee is chaired by the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations ( director of Labor Relations ) and Group Sustaina- bility and managed by the head of the Group Sustainability group function . Some of the group sectors have their own inter depart- mental sustainability committees , which are coordinated by the relevant sustainability functions . The sustainability performance indicators are consolidated in the Continental Group \u2019 s sustainability scorecard , which is approved annually by the Grou p Sustainability Steering Committee on behalf of the Executive Board . The scorecard is based on defined quality criteria for the indicators , is continuously developed further and establishes the formal basis for integrating sustainability into other corporate processes . The topic of sustainability is also an integral part of the Continental Group \u2019 s strategy development . Significant investments must be re- viewed and assessed as to their contribution to sustainability as a standard part of the approval process . For the Autom otive , Tires and ContiTech group sectors , detailed roadmaps for the implementation of sustainability ambitions in the relevant topic areas are under de- velopment . Remuneration The Executive Board and managers are measured against the achievement of sustain ability goals . Long -term remuneration com- ponents ( long -term incentive \u2013 LTI ) are thus linked to sustainability aspects . The LTI plans are updated on an annual basis . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Executi ve Board . Cultural change In order to support cultural change in the organization , we stepped up internal communication with respect to sustainability in fiscal 2022 , held numerous events and further integrated the topic into key internal event formats for managers . These events include the annual Global Sustainability Conference , which is attended by Con- tinental employees from all over the world . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 42 Results of the concept The waste for recovery quota was at 85 % in fiscal 2022 ( PY : 81 % ) . This was mainly due to the successful implementation of local pro- jects as well as to market conditions , which allowed for increased waste rec overy . Circular economy performance indicator 20222 20212 Waste for recovery quota in % 1 85 81 1 Definition : proportion of waste that has been sent for material recycling , thermal recovery or any other form of recycling or reuse . 2 Contains a small amount of imputed data for parts of the Continental Group that did not report data directly . For more information on the circular economy , see the integrated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Responsible value chain Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we strive for 100 % respon- sible sourcing and business partnerships by 2050 at the latest , to- gether with our partners along the value chain . Our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations . Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers , industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks . Concept In the reporting year , a comprehensive management system for ensuring due diligence within a responsible value chain was devel- oped and launched . The global implementation of the system in stages is designed to achieve continuous improvement and to re- spect both human and environmental rights along the value chain . This covers both Continental \u2019 s own operations and in particular those of direct suppliers . For this purpose , responsibilities , rules and processes are clearly defined , including control mechanisms . The management system is guided by specific commitments in the areas of labor standards , occupational health and safety , the environment , safety practices and land rights . The aim of the system is to ensure the corresponding laws are observed and recognized , in particular the requirements under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ) . It is also aimed at system- atically applying due diligence procedures , reducing risks , support- ing the implementation of customer requirements and supplement- ing the existing internal control system . Within the system , our Business Partner Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements , among others for our suppliers , and for their suppliers , including with regard to human rights , working conditions , environmental protection , conflict minerals an d anti- corruption . The Code of Conduct is updated regularly to reflect changes or adjustments to legislation . For suppliers of natural rub- ber , our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber additionally applies . Violations of our rules can be reported via the Integrity Hot- line , which is available around the clock and worldwide . When Continental is notified about violations of our Business Part- ner Code of Conduct , these will be checked , and , if necessary , fur- ther appropriate measures will be initiated n ecessary . Where busi- ness partners are proven to have violated our Business Partner Code of Conduct , Continental requests and monitors remedial measures and reserves the right to terminate the business relation- ship as a last resort . Sustainability aspects a re also taken into consideration at various other points in supplier management . For example , selected suppli- ers are evaluated based on various criteria using self-assessment questionnaires , which we collect via the generally accepted sustain- ability platfo rms for our industries , such as EcoVadis and NQC . These questionnaires are reviewed annually at the corporate level . Furthermore , selective local audits or other audit activities \u2013 such as in relation to the existence of management systems \u2013 are also carried out . We also continue to develop our approach for the responsible value chain in dialog with external stakeholders and support the development of industry -wide standards , for example through our participation in industry dialog with the German governmen t on human rights in the automotive industry . Here , we have worked in particular to cultivate a shared understanding of industry risks and due diligence requirements . We are also involved in initiatives and associations such as econsense , the Responsible B usiness Alliance ( RBA ) and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber ( GPSNR ) . Responsible sourcing is the responsibility of the relevant purchas- ing organizations , which are established at Continental by group sector , product group and country , for example . A corporate pur- chasing network regularly deals with responsible sourcing topi cs as well . The Group Quality group function coordinates the manage- ment of conflict minerals , including the corresponding reporting processes . Results of the concept To further increase transparency and sustainability in Continental \u2019 s natural rubber suppl y chain , the joint venture \u201c Rubberway , \u201d which was founded in 2019 , was rolled out further for the digital risk analy- sis of the upstream supply chain . The joint project with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit ( GIZ ) in the Indone- sian province of West Kalimantan , which has been in place since 2018 , was also further expanded . The aim of the project is to jointly drive forward the implementation of a digital system for the tracea- bility of natural rubber from the project reg ion . By optimizing the supply chain and offering training in the sustainable cultivation of natural rubber , smallholders are supported in boosting the quantity , quality and yield of their produce and in this way improving their income . In addition , a culti vation strategy designed around sustain- ability prevents clearing and deforestation , thereby conserving val- uable resources . As part of a development project with Security Matters ( SMX ) , Continental is working on testing a tamper -proof means of verification of the geographical origin of natural rubber using marker technologies . In fiscal 2022 , field testing was success- fully completed , and the marker substance could be verified beyond doubt throughout the entire tire production process . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 43 As at December 31 , 2022 , 1,009 valid supplier self -assessment questionnaires were available via the two sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC ( PY : 631 ) . This corresponds to a completion rate of 63 % of suppliers selected for this process ( PY : 53 % ) . The increase in the number of available valid supplier self -assessment question- naires and the higher completion rate are due to the onboarding of ContiTech suppliers in EcoVadis and the follow -up activities with suppliers to update and renew their self -assessment questionnaires . Responsible value chain performance indicator 2022 2021 Number of available valid supplier self-assessment questionnaires ( as at December 31 ) 1 1,009 631 1 Based on the self -assessment questionnaires via the sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC completed by suppliers selected for this process . We present further performance indicators for the implementation of a responsible value chain with regard to our own locations in the sections on good working conditions as well as green and safe fac- tories in this combined non -financial statement . For more information on the responsible value chain , see the inte- grated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Good working conditions Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we provide inspiring , healthy and fair working conditions . Concept The Continental Group \u2019 s Code of Conduct sets out the foundation for good working conditions as the basis of our global collabora- tion , including respect for human rights and fair working condi- tions . Employees receive training on compliance with the Code of Conduct . The management system being rolled out for a responsi- ble value chain also includes the company \u2019 s own activities ( see re- sponsible value chain ) . Our HR strategy is geared toward meeting staffing requirements in terms of both quantity and quality . The two HR strategy initiatives \u201c Industrialize Best Fit \u201d and \u201c Enable Transformation \u201d are therefore fo- cused on efficiently and effectively bringing together the right peo- ple and positions and shaping the digital and technological transfor- mation and cultural shift toward new forms of collaboration . Work- force planning , the search for , diagnostic selection and development of talent ( in particular in the areas of software and IT ) , the promotion of employee diversity and lifelong learning , the further development of the management culture and the flexibilization of working hou rs are therefore essential action fields of strategic HR work . We are tackling the impact of our Transformation 2019 \u20132029 structural program , which among other things is associated with the transformation in mobility and is likely to change up to 23,000 jobs worldwide , with targeted training measures for the employees affected . New career prospects and employment opportunities are to be opened up on the internal as well as the external employ- ment markets . Those responsible for HR are the HR functions at Continental Group , group sector , business area and country level , which work together in a global network . A special network of country coordi- nators for labor relations is also part of this organization . We measure the success of HR work against the OUR BA SICS Live Sustainable Engagement index , which is calculated on the basis of the annual employee survey . The index measures employee agree- ment on topics such as whether they personally back the company values and whether they are proud to work for Continent al . Other performance indicators we consult are the sickness rate and the unforced fluctuation rate . The sickness rate measures sickness -re- lated absence relative to contractual work time , and the unforced fluctuation rate measures the voluntary departure o f employees from the company relative to the average number of employees . The OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index has also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board and managers since fiscal 2020 . The sickness rate is also part of this , although only for the plans launched in fiscal 2020 . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . Results of the concept In fiscal 2022 , the Sustainable Engagement in dex was 80 % ( PY : 80 % ) and therefore on par with the previous year . The sickness rate was unchanged at 3.7 % ( PY : 3.7 % ) . For the unforced fluctuation rate , we recorded a slight increase to 7.8 % ( PY : 7.0 % ) . Information about personnel expenses in fiscal 20 22 ( i.e . wages and salaries , social security contributions and pension and post - employment benefit costs ) can be found in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated statement of income in this annual report . Em- ployee benefits such as pensions , post -employmen t benefits and long-term bonus payments are broken down in Note 29 of the notes to the consolidated statement of financial position . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Corporate Profile 45 Benchmark in quality Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we are recognized by our customers and society as being a benchmark in quality by ensur- ing safe and sustainable products . Concept The decisi ve factor in becoming a benchmark in quality is a quality - oriented company culture . Our quality policy sets out guidelines for product and process quality at Continental . Product recalls , product liability claims and proceedings as a result of quality defe cts repre- sent a business risk that we want to avoid due to the resulting losses of sales , costs , and loss of customer and market acceptance . For more information , see the report on risks and opportunities in this annual report . Local management systems dr ive forward the implementation of these guidelines . The concrete organizational and technical require- ments can be found in the relevant quality management manuals for the group sectors . The extent of these certifications is assessed on an annual basis as t o how many employees they cover with re- spect to quality management systems . The number of new field quality events is used as an effectiveness indicator for our quality management . A field quality event is a risk -minimizing measure for a product manufactur ed and/or sold by Continental on the basis of a safety-related defect and/or non -compliance with regulations that was initiated by Continental , a customer and/or an authority . The Group Quality group function as well as the quality functions at various lev els in the Continental Group , which work together in a global network , are responsible for the strategic , corporate -wide quality management process . Results of the concept As at December 31 , 2022 , certified quality management systems covered 83 % of our em ployees throughout the Continental Group ( PY : 84 % ) . Thirty new field quality events were identified in fiscal 2022 ( PY : 36 ) .

For more information on benchmark in quality , see the integrated sustainability report on our website at www.continental -sustainability.com . Sustainable management practice Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition , we implement effective management processes , fair business practices and responsible cor- porate governance with a balanced view of different perspectives . Concept Group Compliance , which is divided into a central team and regional functions , is responsible for preventing violations in the areas of cor- ruption , antitrust law , money laundering and data protection . This structure is supplemented by compliance coordinators in the coun- tries and at the locations . The fund amental principles of compli- ance management are set out in the Continental Group \u2019 s compli- ance manual . Continental strives for a holistic compliance management system based on a comprehensive analysis of potential compliance risks , followed by the implemen tation of appropriate policies and proce- dures , training , consulting , monitoring and controls that lead to on- going lessons learned and system improvements . The Integrity Hotline and an ombudsman \u2019 s office are on hand to offer support in the detection of vio lations . As a further cornerstone for sustainable management practice , we are committed to promoting employee diversity , which we under- stand as internationality , a balanced gender ratio , and a range of ex- periences and age categories . We have set ourselves the corporate target of increasing the share of female executives and senior exec- utives to 25 % by 2025 and to up to 30 % by 2030 . We intend to achieve this in particular by promoting cultural change in the organization through the expansion of women \u2019 s networks and the holding of diversity workshops and specific events . Gender diversity \u2013 the share of female executives and senior executives \u2013 has also been part of the LTI plans for the mem- bers of the Executive Board and global managers since fiscal 2020 . For more information , see the remuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board . For more information on sustainable management practice and our diversity concept , see the Corporate Governance section of this annual report . For more information on compliance , see the \u201c Struc- ture of the internal control system \u201d section in the report on risks and opportunities . Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Report on Risks and Opportunities 88 The overall situation is analyzed and managed corporate -wide using the risk and opportunity management system . The management of Continental is geared toward sustainably in- creasing the value of each individual operating unit . We evaluate risks and opportunities contin ually and responsibly to achieve our goal of adding value . We define risk as the possibility of internal or external events occur- ring that can have a negative influence on the attainment of our strategic and operational targets . As a global corporation , C ontinen- tal is exposed to a number of different risks , in particular due to the transformation in the mobility industry , that could impair business and , in extreme cases , threaten the company \u2019 s existence . At the same time , this transformation also presents opportunities that we intend to consistently seize , as described in the Strategy of the Continental Group section . We accept manageable risks if the re- sulting opportunities are expected to result in sustainable growth in value . We consider growth in value in terms of the Continental Value Contribution ( CVC ) system described in the Corporate Man- agement section . Continental \u2019 s Internal Control System The governance systems at Continental comprise the internal con- trol system , the risk management system and \u2013 as part of the risk management system \u2013 the compliance management system . The risk management system in turn also includes the early risk identifi- cation system in accordance with Section 91 ( 2 ) of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz \u2013 AktG ) . The Executive Board is responsible for the governance systems , which include all subsidiaries . The Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee monitor the effectiveness of these systems . Structure of the internal control system In order to operate successfully as a company in a complex business environment and to ensure the effectiveness , efficiency and propriety of all processes and compliance with the relevant legal and sub -legis- lative regulations , Continental has established an internal control sys- tem that encompasses all relevant business processes . Key elements of the corporate -wide internal control system are the clear allocation of responsibilities and system -inherent controls in the respective process flows . The two -person rule and separation of functions are fundamental principles of this organization . Continen- tal \u2019 s management also issues guidelines to ensure that all business processes are conducted in an economical , orderly and legally compliant manner . Based on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable guidelines , the internal control system at Continental follows the Three Lines Model . In the first line , system-inherent controls are configured in the company \u2019 s IT systems to support the orderly and economical exe- cution of all process flow transactions in accordance with the cor- porate-wide guidelines . At the same time , these transactional con- trols help to identify risks and deviations that require separate con- sideration . As the controls and process flows established in the first line apply to Continental \u2019 s operating business , they are generally put in place at the level of our operating units , such as our subsidi- aries , business areas and group sectors . In the second line of our internal control system , guidelines for process flows are developed , implemented and updated and com- pliance with controls and guidelines is monitored . Responsibility for this lies primarily with the group functions , in addition to the busi- ness areas and group sectors . The responsibilities include , for ex- ample , the risk management system and the compliance manage- ment system . In order to perform this superv isory and monitoring function , an integrated reporting system has been established that includes , for example , the financial reporting internal control sys- tem ( Financial Reporting ICS ) , the general risk management sys- tem , the compliance risk management sys tem and the tax compli- ance management system . The supervisory and monitoring func- tion is performed on the basis of regular reports and supplemented as needed with effectiveness tests as part of self -audits and regular internal and external reviews . The com pliance management system plays an important role within the second line of defense by helping to prevent , detect and respond to compliance violations . The Group Compliance group function is responsible for the compliance management system . The chief compl iance officer reports directly to the chairman of the Executive Board . The work done by Group Compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting corruption , fraud and other property offenses , violations of antitrust and competition law and money launder ing ; implementing data protection ; and responding to compliance violations . For other legal areas in which there is a risk of compliance violations , responsibility for appropriate and effective compliance management lies with the respective functions , whic h are supported in these tasks by Group Compliance . An effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention . It be- gins with setting an appropriate \u201c tone from the top \u201d by the Executive Board and management and , in addition to risk analysis , includes in particular employee training , compliance consulting and the inter- nal publication of guidelines . In the course of risk analysis , the business activities of Continental are examined for compliance risks within the scope of top -down as Report on Risks and Opportunities Continental AG 2022 Annual Report Management Report Report on Risks and Opportunities 89 well as bottom -up review processes . The risk of compliance viola- tions arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows , the given market situation and activities in certain geographical re- gions . Furthermore , findings from investigations by the Group Inter- nal Audit group function as well as discussions with management and employees at all hierarchical levels are taken into account . This risk analysis is not a one -off procedure , but is performed annually and continuously updated . Prevention is also fostered by cons ultation on specific matters with Group Compliance and by the internal publication of guidelines on topics such as anti -corruption ( including giving and receiving gifts as well as donations and sponsoring ) , antitrust and competition law , anti-money launder ing and data protection . In training events , Group Compliance addresses topics directly related to everyday compli- ance issues and challenges . Continental introduced the Business Partner Code of Conduct to prevent compliance violations by suppliers , service providers , rep- resentatives or similar third parties . This must be recognized as a basic requirement for doing business with Continental . In the context of detection , Continental has set up an Integrity Hot- line to give employees and third parties outside t he Continental Group the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations , its fundamental values and ethical standards . Information on any kind of potential violations , including accounting manipulation , can be reported anonymously via this hotline . The hotline is available world- wide in many different languages . The company \u2019 s investigating units rigorously pursue any and all substantiated leads . Detection also includes the support of regular and incident -related audits conducted by Group Internal Aud it . Compliance -related is- sues are regularly the subject of audits by Group Internal Audit . Responses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence of identified compliance violations . Group Compliance is involved in decision-making on measures that m ay be required , including thor- ough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms of failings in the system . In this way , corresponding gaps can be closed preventively and the compliance management system , as well as the internal control syste m , can be systematically developed . The third line of our internal control system is our Group Internal Audit group function . Group Internal Audit serves an independent and objective auditing and advisory function , applying a systematic approach to help r e- view , assess and improve the adequacy and effectiveness of the or- ganization \u2019 s governance systems . Continental \u2019 s Executive Board au- thorizes Group Internal Audit to conduct audits in all regions , com- panies or functions of Continental AG and its affiliated , fully consoli- dated subsidiaries worldwide . Group Internal Audit prepares an annual risk -oriented audit plan that is submitted to Continental \u2019 s Executive Board for review and approval . In addition to its planned general audits , Group Internal Audit also co nducts special investigations . These are based on tips and information about fraudulent acts received from internal or external sources such as the Integrity Hotline or the ombudsman \u2019 s office . Group Internal Audit regularly reports its audit and investiga tion re- sults to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee . Significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies . The imple- mentation by management of the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and re- ported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee . Appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system The three -tier structure of the internal control system at Cont inen- tal and the associated guidelines and processes introduced world- wide fundamentally ensure that the relevant business processes are performed properly , economically and in compliance with legal regulations . Nevertheless , an internal control system canno t pro- vide complete protection , particularly if internal controls and guide- lines are intentionally circumvented . To proactively prevent and de- tect such circumvention , Continental has established monitoring functions at the various levels of the internal con trol system . Group Internal Audit assumes a particularly important role in this regard . Internal monitoring of compliance with internal controls is supple- mented by information we receive from external audits , for exam- ple as part of ISO certifications , cust omer and supplier audits , com- pany audits , customs audits and IT audits . These findings are taken into account when updating and making necessary adjustments to our internal control system . Continental \u2019 s Executive Board is kept continuously informed of the results of internal audit activities , external audits and governance system reporting , all of which form the basis for the Executive Board \u2019 s assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system . The increased volatility of our business environment , the transfor- mation of the automotive industry , the ever faster pace of techno- logical development and the necessary consideration of sustaina- bility aspects have shown that an internal control system must be continuously adapted"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

It\nreviewed the Board of Management\u2019s fixed compensation on a regular basis and considered the long-term\nvariable compensation for the Board of Management. The Board additionally discussed in detail the financial\nplanning for fiscal 2023 proposed by the Board of Management and the medium-term outlook also presented. It\napproved both the financial plan and the financing framework proposed for fiscal 2023. In this meeting, the\nSupervisory Board also planned the AGM to be held in the year 2023, discussing the agenda and proposed\nresolutions and approved the decision of the Board of Management to hold the 2023 AGM as a virtual meeting. In\nthis meeting, the Supervisory Board also voted to issue an unqualified declaration of conformity with the GCGC.\nCovestro AG Supervisory Board (as of December 31, 2022; from left to right):\nFirst row: Dr. Richard Pott, Petra Kronen, Dr. Christine Bortenl\u00e4nger, Dr. Christoph G\u00fcrtler\nSecond row: Lise Kingo, Irena K\u00fcstner, Frank L\u00f6llgen, Petra Reinbold-Knape\nThird row: Dr. Sven Schneider, Regine Stachelhaus, Marc Stothfang and Patrick Thomas\nCommittees of the Supervisory Board\nIn the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board had five permanent committees set up so that it can continue to\nexercise its duties effectively and efficiently. The committees prepared resolutions by the full Supervisory Board\nand provided information on other topics to be discussed by this body. Moreover, certain decision-making\npowers of the Supervisory Board were delegated to the committees to the extent legally permissible. The\nSupervisory Board currently has the following permanent committees: Presidial Committee, Audit Committee,\nHuman Resources Committee, Nominations Committee, and Sustainability Committee.\nThe tasks and responsibilities of the standing committees and their current composition are described in greater\ndetail in \u201cDeclaration on Corporate Governance\u201d under \u201cCommittees of the Supervisory Board\u201d in the Combined\nManagement Report.\nThe meetings and decisions of all committees, and especially those of the Audit and Sustainability Committees,\nwere prepared on the basis of reports and explanations provided by the Board of Management. The committee\nchairs regularly provided comprehensive reports on the work of the committees to the full Supervisory Board.\n24 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe Presidial Committee, on which shareholders and employees are equally represented, made preparations in\nthe year 2022 for the decisions relating to the qualification matrix required by the new GCGC and convened for a\nmeeting for this purpose on November 23, 2022. This followed the preparation by the Nomination Committee of\na proposed qualification matrix, including a review of and adjustments to the Supervisory Board\u2019s areas of skill.\nThe Audit Committee met a total of four times in the year under review: on February 21, May 2, July 25, and\nOctober 24, 2022, each time in the presence of the CFO. Three of these meetings were also attended by the\nauditor. The Audit Committee conducted a preparatory review of the Financial Statements of Covestro AG, the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Covestro Group, the Combined Management Report, and the proposal\nfor the use of the distributable profit for the Supervisory Board. Additionally, it also discussed in detail the\nrespective audit report and in particular, along with the oral report by the auditor on the material results of the\naudit. The Combined Management Report also included the Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement. In conducting its\nreview, the Audit Committee found no grounds for objections. It recommended to the Supervisory Board to\napprove the Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021 as well as to consent to\nthe Combined Management Report and the proposal for the use of the distributable profit. In addition, the Audit\nCommittee discussed with the Board of Management the half-year financial report in light of the results of the\nreview by the auditor, and the Q1 and Q3 2022 interim statements prior to their publication.\nThe Audit Committee monitored the accounting and financial reporting process and the appropriateness and\neffectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system,\nincluding sustainability-related aspects, and deliberated on the audit of the Financial Statements and compliance.\nIn doing so, the Committee received reports, including from the heads of Corporate Audit and the Corporate Law,\nIntellectual Property & Compliance functions and from the auditor. No material weaknesses were identified in the\ninternal control system for financial reporting purposes or the risk early warning system.\nThe Audit Committee additionally undertook preparations for the Supervisory Board\u2019s proposal for the\nappointment of the financial statement auditor by the AGM, the engagement of the auditor and agreement on the\nauditor\u2019s fee. It monitored the quality of the audit and the independence of the auditor as well as the\nsupplementary non-audit services provided in addition to the financial statement audit. In this context, the\ncommittee had the auditor confirm their independence.\nThe Audit Committee discussed the audit risk assessment, audit strategy, audit planning, key audit matters, and\naudit results with the auditor. The Chairman of the Audit Committee had regular feedback sessions with the\nauditor on the audit progress and reported on this to the Audit Committee.\nParticular topics discussed by the Audit Committee in the fiscal year under review were current and future\nregulatory requirements for sustainability reporting and their implementation, including especially the\nrequirements of the EU Taxonomy; the amendments to the GCGC; pension plan asset management; information\nsecurity; and cyber risk management. Furthermore, the Audit Committee obtained information on an ongoing\nbasis on enhancements to the compliance management system (particularly regarding anti-corruption\nmeasures), the handling of suspected compliance violations, progress in significant litigation, new legal and\nregulatory risks, and the risk situation, risk tracking, and risk monitoring in the Group. The Corporate Audit function\nprovided regular reports about risk assessments.\nThe heads of the relevant corporate functions also participated in meetings of the Audit Committee on selected\nagenda items, reported on these, and answered questions. In addition, the Chair of the Audit Committee\ndiscussed important matters between meetings, particularly with the Supervisory Board Chair, the CFO and the\nauditor. The key results of these discussions were reported regularly to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory\nBoard. The Audit Committee continued its practice of closed sessions in the year under review. They allow the\nauditor and the committee during the meeting to have a discussion without the Board of Management being\npresent.\n25 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nIn the reporting period, the Human Resources Committee met for a total of five meetings held on February 22,\nApril 21, June 9, September 28, and December 16, 2022. Topics of particular importance in connection with\nlong-term succession planning for the Board of Management in the past year also included the reappointment of\nthe CEO, Dr. Markus Steilemann, and the extension of his contract as well as succession planning for the CTO.\nThe CTO succession planning was on the agenda of the Human Resources Committee meetings in February,\nJune, and September.\nIn its first meeting on February 22, the committee discussed the CTO succession planning, as well as target\nattainment by the members of the Board of Management, long-term variable compensation of the Board of\nManagement, and adjustments to the description of the compensation system for the Board of Management.\nThe meetings on April 21 and June 9 focused on the reappointment of the CEO and the extension of his contract.\nIn the fourth meeting held on September 28, the Human Resources Committee dealt in particular with the\nreappointment of Dr. Klaus Sch\u00e4fer and the extension of his contract and the appointment of Dr. Thorsten Dreier\nas member of the Board of Management and successor to Dr. Sch\u00e4fer as of July 1, 2023. It also approved\nDr. Thomas Toepfer\u2019s membership of the Regional Advisory Council for the Central Region of Commerzbank AG.\nThe agenda of the meeting held on December 16 included the annual review of the appropriateness of Board of\nManagement compensation, long-term variable compensation of the Board of Management, and short-term\nvariable compensation for the current year.\nThe members of the Nomination Committee held a meeting on September 22 of the reporting year to discuss\nthe skills profile and the qualification matrix of the Supervisory Board required by the GCGC. The Nomination\nCommittee reviewed and added to the skills profile to meet the requirements of the new version of the GCGC. In\nthis meeting, the Nomination Committee also prepared the qualification matrix required by the GCGC, which was\nsubsequently processed further by the Presidial Committee.\nThe Sustainability Committee convened for a total of five meetings. In its first meeting on February 1, it dealt\nwith Covestro\u2019s path to climate neutrality (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and related proposals on objectives\nand implementation measures. The committee also discussed the EU\u2019s chemicals strategy and the approach\nadopted by Covestro in response. In its second meeting on March 30, the focus was on Scope 3 emissions and\nhow they relate to the circular economy. In the third meeting on June 7, the Scope 3/circular economy topic was\nraised again on the basis of examples from the market. In addition, discussions centered on ratings by external\nrating agencies on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, and the approach pursued by Covestro\nin this regard. Another topic at this meeting was the concept for the K plastics trade fair in October 2022, with a\nfocus on sustainable solutions and the circular economy. In the fourth meeting on September 9, the committee\ndiscussed the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring performance against targets. It also considered\nthe ESG aspect of \u201cCompliance with human rights\u201d and spent time on the topic of \u201cTransparency of our reporting\u201d\n(current forms of reporting at Covestro and future requirements, in particular in accordance with the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). The topics focused on at the fifth\nmeeting on November 25 included a progress update on ESG reporting, the 2022 materiality assessment, and\nthe annual planning of the topics of the Sustainability Committee for the year 2023.\n26 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nMANAGEMENT REPORT PROFILE\nCombined Management Report of the Covestro Group and Covestro AG\nThe Combined Management Report pertains to both the Covestro Group and Covestro AG. This report covers\nthe period from January 1 to December 31, 2022. The presentation of the results of operations, financial position,\nand net assets as well as the expected development, including the principal opportunities and risks, relate to the\nCovestro Group, unless otherwise noted. Information that applies to Covestro AG only is identified accordingly.\nThe results of operations, financial position, and net assets of Covestro AG are presented in a separate chapter\nof the Report on Economic Position. In addition, the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c\nin conjunction with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB is integrated into the Group Management Report.\nThis includes the statements in accordance with the European Union\u2019s Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).\nA nonfinancial statement in accordance with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB does not have to be\nprovided for Covestro AG.\nNonfinancial Reporting\nCovestro reports comprehensively and transparently about topics important from the company's perspective\nand for our stakeholders. We measure our sustainability performance using financial indicators as well as key\nnonfinancial indicators published in the Group Management Report. Our objective here is to highlight how closely\nlinked environmental and societal factors are with responsible corporate governance and the long-term success\nof our business. The Group Management Report and the supplementary sustainability information together\ncomprise our annual sustainability reporting. We supplement the nonfinancial information in the Group\nManagement Report by reporting additional content, which meets the requirements of the \u201cwith reference to GRI\u201d\nreporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) and is identified\nseparately.\nFor all reportable aspects, the nonfinancial statement includes the policies we pursue in addressing\nenvironmental matters, employee matters, and social matters as well as respect for human rights and anti-\ncorruption and bribery matters, the due diligence processes followed, as well as the outcomes of these\nstrategies. Nonfinancial performance indicators are reported only when these are important to the Covestro\nGroup.\nAs an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial statement was audited with reasonable\nassurance by our auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany). The supplementary\nsustainability information specifically identified as such additionally contributes to the transparency of our\nreporting, which meets the requirements of the \u201cwith reference to GRI\u201d reporting option of the Global Reporting\nInitiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS). We voluntarily report the management approaches for\nmaterial topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). The supplementary sustainability information that is not part of\nour statutory audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements was subjected to a separate review with limited\nassurance pursuant to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 by KPMG AG\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany).\nEnvironmental Performance Indicators\nEnvironmental protection performance indicators are reported for all fully consolidated companies. Since these\nfigures are calculated only at the end of the year, they include the group of companies consolidated as it stands\nat year-end. In this process, we incorporate data from all environmentally relevant Covestro sites, i.e., all\nproduction sites and relevant administrative sites. This data is used in addition to the environmental reporting\ncontained in this report to communicate with various stakeholders, e.g., associations, the press, and government\nagencies, as well as to continually improve our environmental performance. In order to comply with publication\ndeadlines, the sites estimate the environmental data for the final weeks of the current fiscal year on the basis of\nestablished estimation methodologies that ensure accurate reporting of data as close as possible to the actual\nfigures for the year. If, however, in the course of the following year, we become aware of material deviations based\non internally defined thresholds, the figures in question are corrected retroactively. This was not required in fiscal\n2022 for the preceding fiscal year 2021.\n32 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe reporting of direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, e.g., from burning fossil energy sources and from our\nproduction processes (Scope 1), of indirect GHG emissions from the provision and use of energy produced\noutside the company (Scope 2), and of GHG emissions from upstream and downstream processes in the value\nchain (Scope 3), is based on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes all fully consolidated\ncompanies. If, in our efforts to achieve climate neutrality, measures are taken to offset emissions in relation to our\nScope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, they are disclosed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The\nglobal warming potential (GWP) factors correspond to the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nAlternative Performance Measures\nThroughout its financial reporting, Covestro uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to assess the\nbusiness performance of the Group. These are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRSs) adopted by the European Union (EU). These non-IFRS indicators should be considered a supplement to,\nnot a replacement for, the financial performance measures determined in accordance with IFRSs. The alternative\nperformance measures of relevance to the Covestro Group include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,\nand amortization (EBITDA), return on capital employed (ROCE), free operating cash flow (FOCF), and net financial\ndebt. The calculation methods for the APMs may vary from those of other companies, thus limiting the extent of\nthe overall comparability. These alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation or employed\nas an alternative to the financial indicators determined in accordance with IFRSs and presented in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for purposes of assessing Covestro\u2019s results of operations, financial position,\nand net assets.\nExplanations of the definition and calculation of these alternative performance measures can be found in the \u201cManagement\u201d section.\n33 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nInternal Control System to Ensure Compliance\nCompliance risks are systematically identified and assessed as part of Covestro\u2019s Group-wide risk management.\nRisk owners assess the compliance risks that have been identified. A risk matrix is used to define focal points of\ncompliance tasks at Covestro. The findings of a risk-based analysis enabled Covestro to identify four key topics:\nantitrust law, corruption, data protection, and foreign trade law. The General Counsel/Chief Compliance Officer is\nthe risk owner responsible for breaches of antitrust law and corruption, while the Global Export Control Officer\noversees the risk of breaches of foreign trade law, and the Group Data Protection Officer is assigned to handling\nthe risk of loss and improper handling of personal data. With respect to corruption, areas including gifts and\ninvitations, relationships with government officials, and relationships with certain business partners such as sales\nagents were identified as being especially risk-relevant. A corruption risk analysis was performed in the year\nunder review for all companies in which Covestro holds a majority interest. If the risk profile changes, new\ncontrols are implemented if needed.\nMany controls have been implemented at both the global and local levels to reduce the number of compliance\nrisks. To the extent possible, we integrate the compliance controls into our internal control system. The\neffectiveness of the compliance controls is evaluated on the basis of a cascaded self-assessment system, as are\nthe ICS processes for accounting and financial reporting. The results of the effectiveness evaluations are\ndocumented in the global system for the ICS processes. The Corporate Audit function regularly reviews the\ncompliance activities in independent, objective audits as part of dedicated compliance checks in the larger\ncompanies. In the smaller companies, compliance aspects are part of a general review.\nRisk Management System\nCovestro has implemented a structured risk management process for the early identification of any potentially\ndisadvantageous developments that could have a material impact on our business or endanger the continued\nexistence of the company. This process satisfies the legal requirements regarding an early warning system for\nrisks pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, and is aligned with the\ninternational risk management standard COSO II Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrated Framework (2004).\nRisk management system\n155 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCorporate Risk Management defines, coordinates, and monitors the framework and standards for this risk\nmanagement system, ensuring adequate risk communication and reporting to both management and the risk\nmanagers. Covestro uses risk management software that simplifies the aggregation of risks, provides displays of\nvarious interdependencies, and compares individual risks to the risk bearing capacity.\nRisks are identified, evaluated, and controlled in the operating divisions and corporate functions by the respective\nrisk managers, who are organized in various global sub-committees. The Covestro Corporate Risk Committee\nmet three times in fiscal 2022 to review the risk landscape as well as the various risk management and monitoring\nmechanisms that are in place, and to take any necessary measures. Additionally, we conduct an ad-hoc process\nfor newly identified risks throughout the year so that these are immediately incorporated into the risk\nmanagement system. These ad-hoc risks are identified and their handling is determined based on risk\nassessments and depending on the defined thresholds. In addition, the Corporate Audit function complements\nthe monitoring process with process-independent monitoring.\nFinancial risks are evaluated using estimates of the potential impact after taking into account countermeasures\nand the likelihood of their occurrence. The potential economic losses are projected using the expected EBITDA\nloss and, in some individual cases, the FOCF loss. All material risks and the respective countermeasures are\ndocumented in the risk management software, which is used throughout the Group. The risk management\nsystem is reviewed regularly over the course of the year. Significant changes must be promptly entered in the\nsoftware and reported to the Board of Management. In addition, a report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the\nAudit Committee several times a year and to the Supervisory Board at least once a year.\nNonfinancial risks associated with our own business activities, business relations, or products are also recorded.\nThe extent of losses associated with these risks is evaluated on a quantitative and/or qualitative basis. In\nquantitative evaluation, any potential EBITDA loss is estimated. This also takes into consideration any\ncountermeasures that have a mitigating effect on the potential extent of losses or the probability of the risk. A\nqualitative assessment of the impact is made on the basis of criteria such as strategic effect, influence on our\nreputation, or possible loss of confidence among groups of stakeholders.\nThe following matrix illustrates the quantitative and qualitative criteria for rating a risk as high, medium, or low. The\nsame applies to the classification of nonfinancial risks.\nRating matrix\n1 An individual risk that could have both a direct financial and an indirect financial impact of different severities is always classified based on the higher level of risk.\n156 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nProcess-Independent Monitoring\nThe effectiveness of our management systems is evaluated at regular intervals by the Corporate Audit function,\nwhich performs an independent and objective audit focused on verifying compliance with laws and policies.\nCorporate Audit also supports the company in achieving its goals by systematically evaluating the efficiency and\neffectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes and helping to improve them. This\nincludes internal monitoring of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk\nmanagement system. The selection of audit targets follows a risk-based approach. Corporate Audit performs its\nduties according to internationally recognized standards. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee is regularly\ninformed about the results of audits and also receives an annual report on the internal control system and its\neffectiveness.\nRisks in the areas of occupational health and safety, plant safety, environmental protection, and product quality\nare assessed through specific health, safety, environment, energy, and quality (HSEQ) audits.\nThe external auditor assesses the early warning system for risks as part of its audit of the financial statements,\nfocusing on whether the system is fundamentally suitable for identifying at an early stage any risks that could\nendanger the company\u2019s continued existence so that suitable countermeasures can be taken. The auditor also\nreports at regular intervals to Covestro AG\u2019s Board of Management and the Audit Committee as well as the\nSupervisory Board on the results of the audit and any weaknesses identified in the internal control system. Audit\noutcomes are also taken into account in the continuous improvement of our management processes.\nOpportunities and Risks\nOverall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks\nParticularly in the year 2022, Covestro\u2019s business environment was severely affected by geopolitical events, such\nas the Russian war against Ukraine, a rise in inflation trends around the world, higher energy and raw material\nprices, disrupted global supply chains, and the global acceleration in recessionary trends. However, the overall\nopportunity and risk position of the Group, has not changed significantly compared to the previous year. The\nlatest assessment of financial and nonfinancial risks shows that none of the risks reported below endanger the\ncompany\u2019s continued existence. Nor could we identify any risk interdependencies that could combine to\nendanger the company\u2019s continued existence.\nBased on our product portfolio, our know-how, and our innovation capability, we are confident that we can use\nthe opportunities resulting from our business practices and successfully master the challenges resulting from the\nrisks stated below.\nOpportunities and Risks in General and in the Company\u2019s Business Environment\nThe risks outlined below may have material effects on EBITDA and, in individual cases, the FOCF of our Group\nwithin the one-year forecast period. In this context, risks are deemed material if the potential loss to Covestro is\nestimated at \u20ac50 million or more and/or they have at least a moderate potential qualitative impact. The likelihood\nof occurrence of the risks is used for internal management purposes to define focus areas for the Corporate Risk\nCommittee. The risks are more highly aggregated in this report than in our internal documentation. Various\nindividual risks are combined into risk categories we have defined for this purpose. The following overview shows\nthe levels of risk allocated to the individual risks within each category. A risk category can therefore include more\nthan one weighted risk occurrence level. The order in which the risk categories are listed does not reflect their\nsignificance. Unless explicit information to the contrary is provided, the opportunities and risks described below\nalways refer to both segments of Covestro.\nFinancial opportunities and risks that affect neither EBITDA nor FOCF are presented separately at the end of the\nchapter.\n157 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nRisk management considers risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group\u2019s objectives by having a\nnegative impact on the existing business or strategic goals. They are included in our risk portfolio, which is in turn\nlinked to the material sustainability topics and the topics of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD).\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/tcfd22\nRisk categories by weighted risk occurrence\nBusiness Environment\nGeopolitical Tensions and Social Upheavals\nIn the year 2022, we saw geopolitical tensions between regional powers, whose effects included a decline in\nproduct demand, rising energy and raw material prices, and disruptions in the supply chains. There is great\ngeneral uncertainty about how existing trade conflicts and tensions will develop, including the associated\nmacroeconomic implications, which could also have an impact on Covestro\u2019s business situation.\nMarket Development\nGeneral economic conditions worldwide and, in particular, in the geographic regions in which Covestro operates\nare a significant factor affecting the company\u2019s earnings, since their effect on the industries in which Covestro\u2019s\ndirect and indirect customers operate affects demand for our company\u2019s products.\nNegative economic developments triggered by a variety of events may have a negative impact on the global\neconomy and international financial markets in general. As a rule, this also adversely affects the sales markets for\nour products, which then usually decreases Covestro\u2019s sales volumes and earnings. However, the extent of the\nimpact of economic developments on sales volumes and earnings also depends on capacity utilization rates in\nthe industry, which in turn depend on the balance between supply and demand for the industry\u2019s products.\nDownturns in demand lead to reduced sales volumes and, ultimately, to reduced capacity utilization, which\nnegatively impacts margins. Conversely, a positive economic environment characterized by growth and upward\ntrends normally leads to improved business success.\n158 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nCovestro\u2019s corporate governance is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles.\nCovestro places great importance on responsible corporate governance. This promise to shareholders, business\npartners, and our employees is based on our commitment to the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\nand Articles of Incorporation that reflect these standards. In pursuing our business activities, we follow company\nprinciples that exceed the requirements of the law and the GCGC. A key concern is combining business success\nwith environmental and social goals, so when making any business decision, we always consider the three\ndimensions of sustainability \u2013 people, planet, profit. The principles guiding our actions, which are also based on\nthese dimensions, are documented in six policies applicable throughout the Group. These provide our employees\nwith guidance in the areas of value creation; sustainability; innovation; employees; health, safety, environment,\nenergy, and quality (HSEQ); and compliance. The standards contained in these policies are mandatory for all\nemployees worldwide.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/sustainability/service-downloads/policies-commitments\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board provide information pertaining to corporate governance in the\nsections that follow, including a Declaration on Corporate Governance for Covestro AG pursuant to Section 289f\nand for the Covestro Group pursuant to Section 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

In doing so, it takes into account the\ninterests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. The Board of Management performs its duties\naccording to the law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Management\u2019s rules of procedure, and the\nrecommendations of the GCGC as stated in the Declaration of Conformity. It ensures compliance with the law\nand internal company policies, and works with the company\u2019s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.\nThe current rules of procedure of the Board of Management are available at: https://www.covestro.com/rulesofprocedure2022\nThe Board of Management defines the long-term goals and strategy for the company and sets forth the\nprinciples and policies for the resulting corporate policies. Furthermore, it coordinates and monitors the most\nimportant activities, defines the company\u2019s portfolio, develops and deploys managerial staff, allocates resources,\nand decides on the management and reporting of the Covestro Group. In this context, the Board of Management\nensures that both, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with social and environmental factors,\nand the ecological and social impact of the company\u2019s activities are systematically identified and assessed. In\naddition to the long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy also takes ecological and social goals into\naccount. Corporate planning incorporates appropriate financial and sustainability-related goals.\nDuring their period of service for Covestro, Board of Management members are subject to a comprehensive non-\ncompete clause. They are obligated to work in the company\u2019s interests at all times and may not pursue any\npersonal interests in making decisions for the company or take advantage of the company\u2019s business\nopportunities for themselves. All Board of Management members are required to disclose any conflicts of\ninterest to the Chair of the Supervisory Board\u2019s Human Resources Committee and the Board of Management\nChair, and inform the other Board of Management members of this fact. Other duties, particularly holding seats on\nSupervisory Boards or comparable governing bodies at companies outside the Group, may only be assumed with\nthe approval of the Supervisory Board.\nThe members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole. However,\nthe individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within the framework of\nthe decisions made by the full Board. The allocation of duties among the members of the Board of Management\nis defined in a written schedule appended to its rules of procedure and listed in the following table. The full Board\nof Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in cases where a decision of the\nfull Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of procedure of the Board of Management\ncontain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by the full Board.\nBoard of Management meetings are held regularly and are convened by the Chair of the Board of Management.\nAny member of the Board of Management may also request that a meeting be convened, notifying the other\nmembers of the matter for discussion. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the\nvotes cast, except where unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chair casts the deciding vote.\nAccording to the Board of Management\u2019s rules of procedure, the Chair bears particular responsibility for\nfunctional coordination of all Board of Management areas. The Chair represents the Board of Management as\nwell as Covestro AG and the Group in dealings with the public and other third parties.\n166 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCompliance\nCompliance Management System\nOur corporate conduct is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles. Compliance with\nlegal and regulatory requirements is integral to our operations. It is only in this manner that we can sustainably\nincrease the company\u2019s enterprise value and safeguard our reputation.\nCompliance Culture and Targets\nIn its Corporate Compliance Policy, Covestro has specified a Group-wide code of conduct that mandates\nfundamental principles and rules for all employees. This code of conduct details our commitment to fair\ncompetition, integrity in business dealings, the principles of sustainability and product stewardship, data\nprotection, upholding of foreign trade and insider dealing laws, the separation of business and private interests,\nproper record-keeping and transparent financial reporting, as well as to providing fair, respectful, and\nnondiscriminatory working conditions. These requirements apply within the company as well as to all interactions\nwith external partners and the general public. Our code of conduct provides a framework for all decisions by the\ncompany and our employees. The Corporate Compliance Policy is available on our intranet and on our website,\nand is part of an information packet distributed to new employees when they are hired.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/profile/procurement/sustainability-in-\nprocurement/supplier-code-of-conduct\nCovestro is aware that employees will likely embrace and exhibit integrity if managers are excellent role models.\nThe Board of Management states very clearly in its Corporate Compliance Policy for all staff that, above and\nbeyond any legal requirements, Covestro elects not to conduct any business activities that would violate our\nrules and that management staff is prohibited from instructing employees otherwise. In this way, management\ncontinuously fosters our compliance culture by, for example, regularly drawing employees\u2019 attention to\ncompliance topics and their significance to the company. At Covestro town hall meetings, for example, Board of\nManagement members regularly present recent compliance cases to employees and underscore the importance\nof complying with statutory requirements and internal regulations.\nSee \u201cCorporate Commitments.\u201d\nWe want to utilize our compliance management system in order to:\n\nWe have taken steps to meet our targets, including implementing an internal control system to ensure\ncompliance rules are followed. The insights gained from our annual evaluation of effectiveness are leveraged in\nour efforts to continually improve our compliance management system.\nSee \u201cInternal Control System to Ensure Compliance.\u201d\n183 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCompliance Organization\nThe Chief Compliance Officer is in charge of all compliance activities at Covestro, and in this function reports\ndirectly to the Board of Management. The corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function is the single\npoint of contact that coordinates Group-wide compliance activities. Chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\nof Covestro, the Compliance Committee is the Group\u2019s top-level decision-making body on these issues. The\nCommittee\u2019s responsibilities include the following: exercising a Group-wide compliance governance function,\ninitiating and approving compliance-related regulations, and approving the annual training plan. In the reporting\nperiod, the Compliance Committee met a total of four times. The suitability and effectiveness of compliance\nactivities are regularly reviewed by the Corporate Audit function in independent, objective audits.\nSee \u201cProcess-Independent Monitoring.\u201d\nData privacy is under the responsibility of the corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function and is\ncoordinated Group-wide. By defining controls and processes, the function works to ensure compliance with legal\nrequirements (in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) and legal judgments to protect\npersonal data of employees, as well as of business partners, media representatives, etc. Local Data Privacy\nOfficers have been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. They serve as local points of\ncontact for employees on all questions regarding data privacy. The Board of Management is informed regularly\nabout activities in the company relating to data privacy law.\nA local Compliance Officer has also been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. This\nperson serves as a local point of contact for employees on all questions regarding legally and ethically correct\nconduct in business situations. The country organizations also have local compliance committees.\nCommunications and Compliance\nCovestro systematically conducts training courses on compliance. Once focus areas have been specified, target\ngroups are defined for each content category and the employees (including managerial staff) are invited.\nCovestro expressly encourages its employees to openly address any doubts about proper conduct in business\nsituations and to solicit advice. We inform all employees whom they can contact if they have any doubts or\nquestions. Covestro has also set up a whistleblowing tool. Employees and third parties can report potential\ncompliance violations through a hotline accessible worldwide or use an online tool that also permits anonymous\nreports. In addition, employees can also report any compliance incidents to their supervisors or to the\nCompliance organization.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/management/compliance\nAn internal policy sets out the principles for handling compliance incidents at Covestro. All suspected\ncompliance incidents are recorded in a central database. Confirmed violations are evaluated, and organizational,\ndisciplinary, or legal measures are taken if necessary.\nCompliance incidents are regularly reported to the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the\nbusiness entities\u2019 management teams. Moreover, a current overview of incidents, including additional information\non various aspects and developments related to this topic, is published in a monthly Compliance Telegram on the\nintranet. This ensures a high degree of transparency for all employees.\nOn a quarterly basis, all companies document risks arising from pending or current legal or administrative\nproceedings. Relevant cases are reported on a regular basis to the Board of Management and to the Audit\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. The material legal risks are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nSee note 26 \u201cLegal Risks\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n184 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nDISCLOSURES ON SUSTAINABILITY\nREPORTING AND GRI INDEX\nCovestro aims to help protect the environment, conserve limited resources, advance society, and create value, all\nby firmly integrating sustainability into our Group strategy and management.\nOur sustainability reporting is based on recognized standards. We report on material topics and nonfinancial\nperformance indicators pursuant to Section 315 (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in our Group\nManagement Report and supplement this information with additional content, which meets the requirements of\nthe \u201cwith reference to\u201d reporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards\n(SRS); this option has been available since the year 2022. We voluntarily report the management approaches for\nmaterial topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). We plan to check whether the use of voluntary GRI reporting\nunder the \u201cin accordance with GRI\u201d option is appropriate against the backdrop of regulatory developments.\nNonfinancial Group Statement\nWe publish the nonfinancial Group statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with\nSections 289c through 289e HGB as an integrated part of the Group Management Report. The respective\nsections include the strategies we pursue in addressing environmental, labor, and social issues as well as\nprotecting human rights and fighting corruption and bribery, including the due diligence processes followed and\nmeasures implemented, as well as the outcomes of these strategies.\nWe applied the GRI standards as a framework for preparing the nonfinancial Group statement.\nKey topics relevant to the nonfinancial Group statement are identified in an internal process and in consideration\nof their significance and implementation within the company. The starting point for this is the materiality\nassessment and the material sustainability topics identified or updated as a result, i.e., the topics that are of\nmedium or high relevance to Covestro and on the aspects of which Covestro\u2019s business activities have a medium\nor high impact. The following table provides an overview of the key sustainability topics with an eye to the relevant\naspects and contains references to the specific sections in the Group Management Report. In order to identify\nand address current developments and sustainability-related opportunities and risks at an early stage, we also\nreview whether there are any new findings relevant to opportunity and risk management. No material risks have\nbeen identified in connection with Covestro\u2019s own business activities, business relationships, or products that\nhave or are very likely to have a severely negative impact on the nonfinancial aspects of the company\u2019s business.\nSee \u201cOpportunities and Risks Report.\u201d\n186 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nKey sustainability topics of the Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement (HGB)\nRelevant aspects in accordance with the\nKey topics of the Group\u2019s nonfinancial Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement (German Section reference in the Group\nstatement (German Commercial Code) Commercial Code) Management Report\n\"Strategy,\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, social matters \"Circular Economy,\u201c\nCircular economy \"Innovation.\u201c\n\"Strategy,\u201d\nClimate neutrality Environmental matters, social matters \"Management,\u201d\n\"Climate Neutrality.\u201d\n\"Management,\u201d\nSustainable R&D based innovation portfolio Environmental matters, social matters\n\"Innovation.\u201c\n\"Strategy,\u201d\nSustainable products & product\nEnvironmental matters, social matters \"Sustainable Products and Product\nstewardship\nStewardship.\u201d\nEmployer attractiveness Employee matters \"Employees.\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, fighting corruption \"Opportunities and Risks Report,\u201c\nCompliance\nand bribery, respect for human rights \"Compliance.\u201c\nEmployee matters, respect for human\nDiversity, equity & inclusion\nrights, social matters \"Employees.\u201c\nInclusive business Social matters \"Social Responsibility.\u201c\nHuman rights Respect for human rights, social matters \"Social Responsibility.\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, social matters,\nSustainability in sourcing fighting corruption and bribery, respect for \"Procurement,\u201c\nhuman rights \"Sustainability in the Supply Chain.\u201c\n\"Integrated Management System for\nEmployee matters, environmental matters, Health, Safety, Environment, Energy,\nHealth & safety\nsocial matters and Quality,\u201c\n\u201eHealth & Safety.\u201c\nAs an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial Group statement was audited by the\nfinancial statement auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany), as part of the audit\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements based on an expansion of the audit engagement.\nA nonfinancial statement or nonfinancial report does not have to be provided at this time for Covestro AG.\n187 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nFor economic activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen, we potentially make a substantial contribution to the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation for selected sites. However, we are not yet able at present to\nfully meet the stringent quality requirements (e.g., product-related lifecycle assessments [LCAs] that go beyond\nexternally certified methodology assessments) that the EU Taxonomy imposes on the evidence to be provided.\nDo No Significant Harm (DNSH)\nFor an activity to qualify as a substantial contribution to one environmental objective, the EU Taxonomy requires\nthat it does not cause significant harm to the five other environmental objectives. In connection with the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was conducted\nfor activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen at site level, using Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6,\n4.5, and 8.5. With regard to the environmental objective of sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources, a risk assessment was likewise performed to establish any possible environmental damage at site\nlevel. For the environmental objective of transition to a circular economy, no criteria had been defined for the\neconomic activity analyzed at the time of publication of this report. As a result, compliance is currently not bound\nby any criteria. The criteria for ensuring that no significant harm is done for the environmental objective of\npollution prevention and control were reviewed in two steps. Employees with the relevant professional expertise\nexamined compliance with the requirements for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation set out\nin Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation on climate change mitigation in connection\nwith the specified guidelines and regulations. At the same time, compliance with the emission values in\nconnection with the best available techniques (BATs) was verified for the sites at which products are\nmanufactured with which we make a substantial contribution to meeting the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation. Finally, a check was performed at site level to make sure that no significant harm is done to the\nenvironmental objective of protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nFor activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen, proof could be provided for the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation that no significant harm was done to the other five environmental objectives. The only\nexception is Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation for the environmental objective of\nclimate change mitigation due to interpretation uncertainty about the provision of evidence, especially in relation\nto subitem g. Taxonomy-eligible products that either do not make a substantial contribution to meeting the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation or cause significant harm to at least one environmental\nobjective are not classified as taxonomy-aligned.\nMinimum Safeguards\nArticle 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to establish processes and procedures to ensure\ncompliance with different rules and regulations. They relate in particular to human rights (including labor and\nconsumer rights), corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition. These requirements correspond to\nCovestro\u2019s culture, which we have made an integral part of our actions on the basis of existing Corporate\nCommitments, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and various Group regulations. To ensure compliance with all legal\nand Group-wide provisions, regulations, guidelines, and standards, including those relevant to the minimum\nsafeguards of the EU Taxonomy, we have implemented processes and controls (e.g., as part of the compliance\nmanagement system, the internal control system, or the integrated Health, Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality\nmanagement system).\nSee \u201cCorporate Policies,\u201d \u201cHealth and Safety,\u201d \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain,\u201d \u201cHuman Rights,\u201d \u201cCompliance,\u201d and note 26\n\u201cLegal Risks\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n189 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe review of the minimum safeguards for human rights relates to Covestro\u2019s overarching management\napproach to respecting human rights, and primarily to the risk analysis conducted as part of the human rights due\ndiligence. In addition to the company\u2019s own business activities, this also covers our direct suppliers. It also\nconsiders the upstream supply chain, especially if there are specific allegations. The comprehensive and ongoing\nrisk analysis covers all of Covestro\u2019s own sites, the supply chain, as well as the use phase and end-of-life of our\nproducts. Depending on the respective risk assessments, various measures are agreed with the suppliers, e.g.,\nsupplier assessments under the TfS initiative* or special human rights training.\nSee \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain\u201d and \u201cHuman Rights.\u201d\nIn addition, as part of the review to establish compliance with the minimum safeguards, we verified at Group level\nthat no final court judgments have been handed down against Covestro in connection with the above issues.\nAlthough no economic activities were reported as taxonomy-aligned in the year 2022, there are no indications\nbased on the review described above to suggest that Covestro does not meet the minimum safeguards under\nArticle 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nWe are planning further activities to be undertaken by our cross-functional Human Rights Task Force, such as\nadditional training for buyers, the completion of guidance for buyers with various measures for suppliers\nprioritized during the risk analysis, or the introduction of a Group-wide guideline on our human rights-related\nmanagement system.\nResult of the Alignment Check\nIn fiscal 2022, we did not identify any taxonomy-aligned economic activities associated with the environmental\nobjective of climate change mitigation.\nCalculation of Taxonomy KPIs\nWe calculate taxonomy KPIs and report on the nature of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic\nactivities in accordance with Article 10(3) and Article 11(3) of the Taxonomy Regulation. We are required to report\nthe share of turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) that are generated by\ntaxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned activities. The way in which we define and document these KPIs and run\nthe data queries for the calculations prevents double-counting amounts when allocating turnover, CapEx, and\nOpEx to our economic activities. Where data could not be definitively allocated or KPIs had to be split between\neconomic activities, we applied allocation models appropriate for the particular process to reflect the technical\ncircumstances in the KPI calculation. The taxonomy KPIs are determined with system support in processes\nestablished for the purpose. Validation steps are taken and the data is checked against the figures in the Group\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements to ensure the data is complete and correct. Controls in our Internal Control\nSystem are used to support the underlying systems and processes.\nSee \u201cMain Features of the Internal Control System.\u201d\nTurnover\nIn order to determine the turnover generated by Covestro from taxonomy-eligible economic activities, we\nallocated the relevant Covestro products to these activities. The corresponding turnover for fiscal 2022 was then\ncalculated for the identified products and a ratio derived using the Covestro Group\u2019s sales reported in the Income\nStatement (denominator). Turnover generated from the activity of high-efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and\npower from fossil gaseous fuels is calculated in the same way.\nSee \u201cCovestro Group Consolidated Income Statement.\u201d\n\nFinancial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities generally comprise primary financial liabilities and negative fair values of derivatives.\nIn subsequent periods, such nonderivative liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest\nmethod. The Covestro Group does not opt to measure financial liabilities at fair value, e.g., to avoid or minimize\naccounting mismatches.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has expired.\nNetting Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities in the context of master netting or similar agreements are netted and the\nnet amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position if the Covestro Group has a present\nlegal entitlement to offset the recognized amounts against one another and there is the intention to balance them\non a net basis or at the same time to settle the corresponding liability with realization of the asset.\nProvisions for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nWithin the Covestro Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and defined\nbenefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately\nadministered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual, or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been\npaid, the company has no further payment obligations. The regular contributions constitute expenses for the year\nin which they are due. As such, they are included in the functional cost items, and thus in EBIT. All other post-\nemployment benefit systems are defined benefit plans, which may be either unfunded, i.e., financed by provisions,\nor funded, i.e., financed through pension funds.\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligations and the resulting expense are calculated in accordance with\nIAS 19 (Employee Benefits) using the projected unit credit method. The future benefit obligations are valued by\nactuarial methods and spread over the entire employment period on the basis of specific assumptions regarding\nbeneficiary structure and the economic environment. These relate mainly to the discount rate, future salary and\npension increases, variations in health care costs, and mortality rates.\nThe discount rates used are calculated from the yields of high-quality corporate bond portfolios in specific\ncurrencies with cash flows approximately equivalent to the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The\nuniform discount rate derived from this interest rate structure is thus based on the yields, on the closing date, of a\nportfolio of corporate bonds with at least an AA or AAA rating whose weighted residual maturities approximately\ncorrespond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.\nThe fair value of plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation for pensions and\nother post-employment benefits to determine the net defined benefit liability. Plan assets in excess of the benefit\nobligation are reflected in other receivables, subject to the asset ceiling specified in IAS 19. Comprehensive\nactuarial valuations for all major plans are performed annually as of December 31.\nThe balance of all income and expenses relating to defined benefit plans, except the net interest on the net\nliability, is recognized in EBIT. The net interest is reflected in the financial result.\nThe effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in other comprehensive income.\nThey consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets, and changes in the effects of the asset\nceiling, less the respective amounts included in net interest for the last two components. Deferred taxes relating\nto the effects of remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.\n251 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Provisions\nOther provisions are measured in accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent\nAssets) or, where applicable, IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Where the cash outflow to settle an obligation is\nexpected to occur after one year, the provision is recognized at the present value of the expected cash outflow.\nClaims for reimbursements from third parties are separately recognized in other receivables if their realization is\nvirtually certain.\nIf the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the\ncorresponding amount and the resulting income generally recognized in the functional cost item(s) in which the\noriginal charge was recognized.\nTo enhance the information content of the estimates, certain provisions that could have a material effect on the\nnet assets, financial position, and results of operations are selected and tested for their sensitivity to changes in\nthe underlying parameters using sensitivity analysis. To reflect uncertainty about the likelihood of the assumed\nevents actually occurring, the impact of a five-percentage-point change in the probability of occurrence is\nexamined in each case.\nProvisions for environmental protection are recognized if future cash outflows are likely to be necessary to\nensure compliance with environmental regulations or to carry out remediation work based on an obligation, such\ncosts can be reliably estimated, and no future benefits are expected from such measures.\nEstimating the future costs of environmental protection and remediation involves many uncertainties, particularly\nwith regard to the status of laws, regulations, and the information available about conditions in the various\ncountries and at the individual sites. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in\nsimilar cases, the conclusions in expert opinions obtained for existing environmental programs, current costs,\nand new developments affecting these costs. Also taken into consideration are management\u2019s interpretation of\ncurrent environmental laws and regulations, the number and financial position of third parties that may become\nobligated to participate in any remediation costs on the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely\nto be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results.\nTaking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature,\nCovestro\u2019s management believes the existing provisions to be adequate based upon currently available\ninformation. Given the business environment in which the Covestro Group operates and the inherent difficulties in\naccurately estimating environmental liabilities, material additional costs beyond the amounts accrued may be\nincurred under certain circumstances. It may transpire during remediation work that additional expenditures are\nnecessary over an extended period and that these exceed existing provisions and cannot be reasonably\nestimated.\nProvisions for restructuring are based either on a legal or a constructive external obligation. They only cover\nexpenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are necessary for restructuring, and are not related to\nfuture business operations. Such expenses include severance payments to employees and compensation\npayments in respect of rented property that can no longer be used. Prior to recognition of this type of provision,\nthe associated assets are tested for impairment.\nRestructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of\nbusiness activities, leveraging of portfolio synergies, or fundamental reorganizations of business units. The\nrespective provisions are recognized when a detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up, resolved by the\nresponsible decision-making level of management, and communicated to the affected employees and/or their\nrepresentatives. Provisions for restructuring are generally recognized at the present value of future cash\noutflows.\nAs a company with international operations, the Covestro Group is exposed to numerous legal risks for which\nprovisions for litigation must be recognized under certain conditions \u2013 especially in the areas of product liability,\ncompetition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax law, environmental law, and compliance issues such as\ncorruption and export control.\n252 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nLitigation and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and\ncomplexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the jurisdiction in\nwhich each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. The outcomes of currently pending and future\nproceedings generally cannot be predicted. Judgment in court proceedings, regulatory decisions, or the\nconclusion of a settlement may result in the Covestro Group incurring charges for which no accounting\nmeasures have been taken for lack of reasonable estimate or which exceed established provisions and insurance\ncoverage.\nThe Covestro Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, and\nthe extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its Law, Intellectual Property &\nCompliance corporate function and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Covestro Group.\nWhere it is more likely than not that such litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably\nestimable, a provision for litigation is normally recognized in the amount of the present value of the expected\ncash outflows. Such provisions cover the estimated unavoidable payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural\ncosts, attorney costs, and the cost of potential settlements.\nIt is often impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the\nprobability that a potential outflow of resources will result from pending or future litigation. Due to the special\nnature of these litigation, provisions are generally not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of\npotential amounts or judgments have been issued, and not before at least a range of possible legal outcomes of\nsuch litigations can be determined. Provisions for legal defense costs are recognized if it is probable that material\ncosts will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the company\u2019s legal position and an outflow of\nresources can generally be expected.\nInternal and external legal counsels evaluate the current status of the material legal risks to the Covestro Group at\nthe end of each reporting period. The need to recognized or adjust a provision and the amount of the provision or\nadjustment are determined on this basis. Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nSee note 26 \u201cLegal Risks.\u201d\nPersonnel-related provisions are mainly those recorded for variable one-time payments, individual performance\nawards, long-service awards, severance payments in connection with early retirement arrangements, surpluses\non long-term accounts, and other personnel costs. Since January 1, 2022, calculation of the provision for short-\nterm variable compensation (\u201cCovestro Profit Sharing Plan\u201d, \u201cCovestro PSP\u201d) has been based not only on the\nachievement of financial performance indicators such as Earnings Before Interest , Taxes, Depreciation and\nAmortization (EBITDA), Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF), and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)\nabove Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), but also on a sustainability component measured on the basis\nof selected environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. In fiscal 2022, measurement was based on\nselected environmental criteria.\nObligations under share-based compensation programs that provide for awards payable in cash are also\nincluded in personnel-related provisions (\u201cPrisma\u201d). The compensation of the Board of Management of\nCovestro AG and of managerial employees includes cash compensation based on the share price that are\nearned with lock-up periods and are reflected in profit or loss as personnel expenses in line with the\nconsideration paid in the performance period. They are measured using a subscription price model at the time of\ngranting and at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment). In 2021, Prisma was\nexpanded to include a sustainability component that covers Covestro\u2019s target for reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions (CO equivalents, CO e).\n2 2\nMiscellaneous provisions include those for other liabilities, for product liability, for warranty, and insurance\npayments. Rebates to be granted to customers, on the other hand are reported under refund liabilities.\n253 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Receivables and Liabilities\nOther receivables are measured at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of\nthe asset.\nPending Transactions\nPending transactions relating to contributions in kind (\u201cexecutory contracts\u201d), i.e., agreements in relation to which\n(to a degree) neither the service nor the consideration has been rendered, are not recognized in the statement of\nfinancial position on the reporting date if there is no risk of a loss on the reporting date. If there is the risk of a loss,\nthis is generally anticipated in the form of provisions if all the other requirements are met. In contrast, gains\nanticipated from such agreements on the reporting date may not be recognized in the statement of financial\nposition. Examples of executory procurement contracts include contracts regarding the procurement of energy\nfor the operation of production facilities, which also includes what are known as power purchase agreements\n(PPA) for the procurement of power from renewable energy. In comparison, pending transactions in the area of\nthe application of the rules regarding financial instruments (financial derivatives) are to be recognized on the\nreporting date in the amount of the negative fair value if a loss is expected and in the amount of the positive fair\nvalue if a gain is expected.\n\n\nThe image is a diagram of a corporate risk management system, detailing the structure and flow of responsibilities within an organization. The system is layered to show different levels of oversight and operational functions related to risk management. Here is a breakdown of each level:\n\n1. **Supervisory Board / Audit Committee**:\n   - At the top, responsible for monitoring the risk management processes. This ensures oversight and accountability.\n\n2. **Board of Management**:\n   - Directly below the Supervisory Board/Audit Committee, this layer has overall responsibility for handling material risks and opportunities within the group. It also ensures the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system.\n\n3. **Corporate Risk Committee**:\n   - This committee ensures a holistic overview of the organization\u2019s risk landscape. It functions under the Board of Management to aggregate and assess risk information from various parts of the organization.\n\n4. **Corporate Risk Management**:\n   - Positioned below the Corporate Risk Committee, this level is responsible for the creation and implementation of risk management guidelines and software. It also handles communication and reporting, process-integrated monitoring, and provides guidance on risk management.\n\n5. **Sub-committees with Risk Owners**:\n   - At the operational level, these sub-committees are involved in the hands-on management of risks. They perform functions such as risk identification, evaluation, and handling, ensuring that risks are managed effectively on the ground level.\n\n6. **Corporate Audit**:\n   - Shown at the base of the diagram, operating independently from the risk management processes to ensure unbiased monitoring of the entire risk management system.\n\nThe diagram uses arrows to indicate the flow of information and responsibility, emphasizing a comprehensive and structured approach to risk management that integrates oversight, management, and execution across different levels of the organization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

It\nreviewed the Board of Management\u2019s fixed compensation on a regular basis and considered the long-term\nvariable compensation for the Board of Management. The Board additionally discussed in detail the financial\nplanning for fiscal 2023 proposed by the Board of Management and the medium-term outlook also presented. It\napproved both the financial plan and the financing framework proposed for fiscal 2023. In this meeting, the\nSupervisory Board also planned the AGM to be held in the year 2023, discussing the agenda and proposed\nresolutions and approved the decision of the Board of Management to hold the 2023 AGM as a virtual meeting. In\nthis meeting, the Supervisory Board also voted to issue an unqualified declaration of conformity with the GCGC.\nCovestro AG Supervisory Board (as of December 31, 2022; from left to right):\nFirst row: Dr. Richard Pott, Petra Kronen, Dr. Christine Bortenl\u00e4nger, Dr. Christoph G\u00fcrtler\nSecond row: Lise Kingo, Irena K\u00fcstner, Frank L\u00f6llgen, Petra Reinbold-Knape\nThird row: Dr. Sven Schneider, Regine Stachelhaus, Marc Stothfang and Patrick Thomas\nCommittees of the Supervisory Board\nIn the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board had five permanent committees set up so that it can continue to\nexercise its duties effectively and efficiently. The committees prepared resolutions by the full Supervisory Board\nand provided information on other topics to be discussed by this body. Moreover, certain decision-making\npowers of the Supervisory Board were delegated to the committees to the extent legally permissible. The\nSupervisory Board currently has the following permanent committees: Presidial Committee, Audit Committee,\nHuman Resources Committee, Nominations Committee, and Sustainability Committee.\nThe tasks and responsibilities of the standing committees and their current composition are described in greater\ndetail in \u201cDeclaration on Corporate Governance\u201d under \u201cCommittees of the Supervisory Board\u201d in the Combined\nManagement Report.\nThe meetings and decisions of all committees, and especially those of the Audit and Sustainability Committees,\nwere prepared on the basis of reports and explanations provided by the Board of Management. The committee\nchairs regularly provided comprehensive reports on the work of the committees to the full Supervisory Board.\n24 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe Presidial Committee, on which shareholders and employees are equally represented, made preparations in\nthe year 2022 for the decisions relating to the qualification matrix required by the new GCGC and convened for a\nmeeting for this purpose on November 23, 2022. This followed the preparation by the Nomination Committee of\na proposed qualification matrix, including a review of and adjustments to the Supervisory Board\u2019s areas of skill.\nThe Audit Committee met a total of four times in the year under review: on February 21, May 2, July 25, and\nOctober 24, 2022, each time in the presence of the CFO. Three of these meetings were also attended by the\nauditor. The Audit Committee conducted a preparatory review of the Financial Statements of Covestro AG, the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Covestro Group, the Combined Management Report, and the proposal\nfor the use of the distributable profit for the Supervisory Board. Additionally, it also discussed in detail the\nrespective audit report and in particular, along with the oral report by the auditor on the material results of the\naudit. The Combined Management Report also included the Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement. In conducting its\nreview, the Audit Committee found no grounds for objections. It recommended to the Supervisory Board to\napprove the Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021 as well as to consent to\nthe Combined Management Report and the proposal for the use of the distributable profit. In addition, the Audit\nCommittee discussed with the Board of Management the half-year financial report in light of the results of the\nreview by the auditor, and the Q1 and Q3 2022 interim statements prior to their publication.\nThe Audit Committee monitored the accounting and financial reporting process and the appropriateness and\neffectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system,\nincluding sustainability-related aspects, and deliberated on the audit of the Financial Statements and compliance.\nIn doing so, the Committee received reports, including from the heads of Corporate Audit and the Corporate Law,\nIntellectual Property & Compliance functions and from the auditor. No material weaknesses were identified in the\ninternal control system for financial reporting purposes or the risk early warning system.\nThe Audit Committee additionally undertook preparations for the Supervisory Board\u2019s proposal for the\nappointment of the financial statement auditor by the AGM, the engagement of the auditor and agreement on the\nauditor\u2019s fee. It monitored the quality of the audit and the independence of the auditor as well as the\nsupplementary non-audit services provided in addition to the financial statement audit. In this context, the\ncommittee had the auditor confirm their independence.\nThe Audit Committee discussed the audit risk assessment, audit strategy, audit planning, key audit matters, and\naudit results with the auditor. The Chairman of the Audit Committee had regular feedback sessions with the\nauditor on the audit progress and reported on this to the Audit Committee.\nParticular topics discussed by the Audit Committee in the fiscal year under review were current and future\nregulatory requirements for sustainability reporting and their implementation, including especially the\nrequirements of the EU Taxonomy; the amendments to the GCGC; pension plan asset management; information\nsecurity; and cyber risk management. Furthermore, the Audit Committee obtained information on an ongoing\nbasis on enhancements to the compliance management system (particularly regarding anti-corruption\nmeasures), the handling of suspected compliance violations, progress in significant litigation, new legal and\nregulatory risks, and the risk situation, risk tracking, and risk monitoring in the Group. The Corporate Audit function\nprovided regular reports about risk assessments.\nThe heads of the relevant corporate functions also participated in meetings of the Audit Committee on selected\nagenda items, reported on these, and answered questions. In addition, the Chair of the Audit Committee\ndiscussed important matters between meetings, particularly with the Supervisory Board Chair, the CFO and the\nauditor. The key results of these discussions were reported regularly to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory\nBoard. The Audit Committee continued its practice of closed sessions in the year under review. They allow the\nauditor and the committee during the meeting to have a discussion without the Board of Management being\npresent.\n25 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nIn the reporting period, the Human Resources Committee met for a total of five meetings held on February 22,\nApril 21, June 9, September 28, and December 16, 2022. Topics of particular importance in connection with\nlong-term succession planning for the Board of Management in the past year also included the reappointment of\nthe CEO, Dr. Markus Steilemann, and the extension of his contract as well as succession planning for the CTO.\nThe CTO succession planning was on the agenda of the Human Resources Committee meetings in February,\nJune, and September.\nIn its first meeting on February 22, the committee discussed the CTO succession planning, as well as target\nattainment by the members of the Board of Management, long-term variable compensation of the Board of\nManagement, and adjustments to the description of the compensation system for the Board of Management.\nThe meetings on April 21 and June 9 focused on the reappointment of the CEO and the extension of his contract.\nIn the fourth meeting held on September 28, the Human Resources Committee dealt in particular with the\nreappointment of Dr. Klaus Sch\u00e4fer and the extension of his contract and the appointment of Dr. Thorsten Dreier\nas member of the Board of Management and successor to Dr. Sch\u00e4fer as of July 1, 2023. It also approved\nDr. Thomas Toepfer\u2019s membership of the Regional Advisory Council for the Central Region of Commerzbank AG.\nThe agenda of the meeting held on December 16 included the annual review of the appropriateness of Board of\nManagement compensation, long-term variable compensation of the Board of Management, and short-term\nvariable compensation for the current year.\nThe members of the Nomination Committee held a meeting on September 22 of the reporting year to discuss\nthe skills profile and the qualification matrix of the Supervisory Board required by the GCGC. The Nomination\nCommittee reviewed and added to the skills profile to meet the requirements of the new version of the GCGC. In\nthis meeting, the Nomination Committee also prepared the qualification matrix required by the GCGC, which was\nsubsequently processed further by the Presidial Committee.\nThe Sustainability Committee convened for a total of five meetings. In its first meeting on February 1, it dealt\nwith Covestro\u2019s path to climate neutrality (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and related proposals on objectives\nand implementation measures. The committee also discussed the EU\u2019s chemicals strategy and the approach\nadopted by Covestro in response. In its second meeting on March 30, the focus was on Scope 3 emissions and\nhow they relate to the circular economy. In the third meeting on June 7, the Scope 3/circular economy topic was\nraised again on the basis of examples from the market. In addition, discussions centered on ratings by external\nrating agencies on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, and the approach pursued by Covestro\nin this regard. Another topic at this meeting was the concept for the K plastics trade fair in October 2022, with a\nfocus on sustainable solutions and the circular economy. In the fourth meeting on September 9, the committee\ndiscussed the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring performance against targets. It also considered\nthe ESG aspect of \u201cCompliance with human rights\u201d and spent time on the topic of \u201cTransparency of our reporting\u201d\n(current forms of reporting at Covestro and future requirements, in particular in accordance with the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). The topics focused on at the fifth\nmeeting on November 25 included a progress update on ESG reporting, the 2022 materiality assessment, and\nthe annual planning of the topics of the Sustainability Committee for the year 2023.\n26 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nMANAGEMENT REPORT PROFILE\nCombined Management Report of the Covestro Group and Covestro AG\nThe Combined Management Report pertains to both the Covestro Group and Covestro AG. This report covers\nthe period from January 1 to December 31, 2022. The presentation of the results of operations, financial position,\nand net assets as well as the expected development, including the principal opportunities and risks, relate to the\nCovestro Group, unless otherwise noted. Information that applies to Covestro AG only is identified accordingly.\nThe results of operations, financial position, and net assets of Covestro AG are presented in a separate chapter\nof the Report on Economic Position. In addition, the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c\nin conjunction with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB is integrated into the Group Management Report.\nThis includes the statements in accordance with the European Union\u2019s Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).\nA nonfinancial statement in accordance with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB does not have to be\nprovided for Covestro AG.\nNonfinancial Reporting\nCovestro reports comprehensively and transparently about topics important from the company's perspective\nand for our stakeholders. We measure our sustainability performance using financial indicators as well as key\nnonfinancial indicators published in the Group Management Report. Our objective here is to highlight how closely\nlinked environmental and societal factors are with responsible corporate governance and the long-term success\nof our business. The Group Management Report and the supplementary sustainability information together\ncomprise our annual sustainability reporting. We supplement the nonfinancial information in the Group\nManagement Report by reporting additional content, which meets the requirements of the \u201cwith reference to GRI\u201d\nreporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) and is identified\nseparately.\nFor all reportable aspects, the nonfinancial statement includes the policies we pursue in addressing\nenvironmental matters, employee matters, and social matters as well as respect for human rights and anti-\ncorruption and bribery matters, the due diligence processes followed, as well as the outcomes of these\nstrategies. Nonfinancial performance indicators are reported only when these are important to the Covestro\nGroup.\nAs an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial statement was audited with reasonable\nassurance by our auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany). The supplementary\nsustainability information specifically identified as such additionally contributes to the transparency of our\nreporting, which meets the requirements of the \u201cwith reference to GRI\u201d reporting option of the Global Reporting\nInitiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS). We voluntarily report the management approaches for\nmaterial topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). The supplementary sustainability information that is not part of\nour statutory audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements was subjected to a separate review with limited\nassurance pursuant to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 by KPMG AG\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany).\nEnvironmental Performance Indicators\nEnvironmental protection performance indicators are reported for all fully consolidated companies. Since these\nfigures are calculated only at the end of the year, they include the group of companies consolidated as it stands\nat year-end. In this process, we incorporate data from all environmentally relevant Covestro sites, i.e., all\nproduction sites and relevant administrative sites. This data is used in addition to the environmental reporting\ncontained in this report to communicate with various stakeholders, e.g., associations, the press, and government\nagencies, as well as to continually improve our environmental performance. In order to comply with publication\ndeadlines, the sites estimate the environmental data for the final weeks of the current fiscal year on the basis of\nestablished estimation methodologies that ensure accurate reporting of data as close as possible to the actual\nfigures for the year. If, however, in the course of the following year, we become aware of material deviations based\non internally defined thresholds, the figures in question are corrected retroactively. This was not required in fiscal\n2022 for the preceding fiscal year 2021.\n32 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe reporting of direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, e.g., from burning fossil energy sources and from our\nproduction processes (Scope 1), of indirect GHG emissions from the provision and use of energy produced\noutside the company (Scope 2), and of GHG emissions from upstream and downstream processes in the value\nchain (Scope 3), is based on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes all fully consolidated\ncompanies. If, in our efforts to achieve climate neutrality, measures are taken to offset emissions in relation to our\nScope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, they are disclosed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The\nglobal warming potential (GWP) factors correspond to the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nAlternative Performance Measures\nThroughout its financial reporting, Covestro uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to assess the\nbusiness performance of the Group. These are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRSs) adopted by the European Union (EU). These non-IFRS indicators should be considered a supplement to,\nnot a replacement for, the financial performance measures determined in accordance with IFRSs. The alternative\nperformance measures of relevance to the Covestro Group include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,\nand amortization (EBITDA), return on capital employed (ROCE), free operating cash flow (FOCF), and net financial\ndebt. The calculation methods for the APMs may vary from those of other companies, thus limiting the extent of\nthe overall comparability. These alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation or employed\nas an alternative to the financial indicators determined in accordance with IFRSs and presented in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for purposes of assessing Covestro\u2019s results of operations, financial position,\nand net assets.\nExplanations of the definition and calculation of these alternative performance measures can be found in the \u201cManagement\u201d section.\n33 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nInternal Control System to Ensure Compliance\nCompliance risks are systematically identified and assessed as part of Covestro\u2019s Group-wide risk management.\nRisk owners assess the compliance risks that have been identified. A risk matrix is used to define focal points of\ncompliance tasks at Covestro. The findings of a risk-based analysis enabled Covestro to identify four key topics:\nantitrust law, corruption, data protection, and foreign trade law. The General Counsel/Chief Compliance Officer is\nthe risk owner responsible for breaches of antitrust law and corruption, while the Global Export Control Officer\noversees the risk of breaches of foreign trade law, and the Group Data Protection Officer is assigned to handling\nthe risk of loss and improper handling of personal data. With respect to corruption, areas including gifts and\ninvitations, relationships with government officials, and relationships with certain business partners such as sales\nagents were identified as being especially risk-relevant. A corruption risk analysis was performed in the year\nunder review for all companies in which Covestro holds a majority interest. If the risk profile changes, new\ncontrols are implemented if needed.\nMany controls have been implemented at both the global and local levels to reduce the number of compliance\nrisks. To the extent possible, we integrate the compliance controls into our internal control system. The\neffectiveness of the compliance controls is evaluated on the basis of a cascaded self-assessment system, as are\nthe ICS processes for accounting and financial reporting. The results of the effectiveness evaluations are\ndocumented in the global system for the ICS processes. The Corporate Audit function regularly reviews the\ncompliance activities in independent, objective audits as part of dedicated compliance checks in the larger\ncompanies. In the smaller companies, compliance aspects are part of a general review.\nRisk Management System\nCovestro has implemented a structured risk management process for the early identification of any potentially\ndisadvantageous developments that could have a material impact on our business or endanger the continued\nexistence of the company. This process satisfies the legal requirements regarding an early warning system for\nrisks pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, and is aligned with the\ninternational risk management standard COSO II Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrated Framework (2004).\nRisk management system\n155 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCorporate Risk Management defines, coordinates, and monitors the framework and standards for this risk\nmanagement system, ensuring adequate risk communication and reporting to both management and the risk\nmanagers. Covestro uses risk management software that simplifies the aggregation of risks, provides displays of\nvarious interdependencies, and compares individual risks to the risk bearing capacity.\nRisks are identified, evaluated, and controlled in the operating divisions and corporate functions by the respective\nrisk managers, who are organized in various global sub-committees. The Covestro Corporate Risk Committee\nmet three times in fiscal 2022 to review the risk landscape as well as the various risk management and monitoring\nmechanisms that are in place, and to take any necessary measures. Additionally, we conduct an ad-hoc process\nfor newly identified risks throughout the year so that these are immediately incorporated into the risk\nmanagement system. These ad-hoc risks are identified and their handling is determined based on risk\nassessments and depending on the defined thresholds. In addition, the Corporate Audit function complements\nthe monitoring process with process-independent monitoring.\nFinancial risks are evaluated using estimates of the potential impact after taking into account countermeasures\nand the likelihood of their occurrence. The potential economic losses are projected using the expected EBITDA\nloss and, in some individual cases, the FOCF loss. All material risks and the respective countermeasures are\ndocumented in the risk management software, which is used throughout the Group. The risk management\nsystem is reviewed regularly over the course of the year. Significant changes must be promptly entered in the\nsoftware and reported to the Board of Management. In addition, a report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the\nAudit Committee several times a year and to the Supervisory Board at least once a year.\nNonfinancial risks associated with our own business activities, business relations, or products are also recorded.\nThe extent of losses associated with these risks is evaluated on a quantitative and/or qualitative basis. In\nquantitative evaluation, any potential EBITDA loss is estimated. This also takes into consideration any\ncountermeasures that have a mitigating effect on the potential extent of losses or the probability of the risk. A\nqualitative assessment of the impact is made on the basis of criteria such as strategic effect, influence on our\nreputation, or possible loss of confidence among groups of stakeholders.\nThe following matrix illustrates the quantitative and qualitative criteria for rating a risk as high, medium, or low. The\nsame applies to the classification of nonfinancial risks.\nRating matrix\n1 An individual risk that could have both a direct financial and an indirect financial impact of different severities is always classified based on the higher level of risk.\n156 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nProcess-Independent Monitoring\nThe effectiveness of our management systems is evaluated at regular intervals by the Corporate Audit function,\nwhich performs an independent and objective audit focused on verifying compliance with laws and policies.\nCorporate Audit also supports the company in achieving its goals by systematically evaluating the efficiency and\neffectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes and helping to improve them. This\nincludes internal monitoring of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk\nmanagement system. The selection of audit targets follows a risk-based approach. Corporate Audit performs its\nduties according to internationally recognized standards. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee is regularly\ninformed about the results of audits and also receives an annual report on the internal control system and its\neffectiveness.\nRisks in the areas of occupational health and safety, plant safety, environmental protection, and product quality\nare assessed through specific health, safety, environment, energy, and quality (HSEQ) audits.\nThe external auditor assesses the early warning system for risks as part of its audit of the financial statements,\nfocusing on whether the system is fundamentally suitable for identifying at an early stage any risks that could\nendanger the company\u2019s continued existence so that suitable countermeasures can be taken. The auditor also\nreports at regular intervals to Covestro AG\u2019s Board of Management and the Audit Committee as well as the\nSupervisory Board on the results of the audit and any weaknesses identified in the internal control system. Audit\noutcomes are also taken into account in the continuous improvement of our management processes.\nOpportunities and Risks\nOverall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks\nParticularly in the year 2022, Covestro\u2019s business environment was severely affected by geopolitical events, such\nas the Russian war against Ukraine, a rise in inflation trends around the world, higher energy and raw material\nprices, disrupted global supply chains, and the global acceleration in recessionary trends. However, the overall\nopportunity and risk position of the Group, has not changed significantly compared to the previous year. The\nlatest assessment of financial and nonfinancial risks shows that none of the risks reported below endanger the\ncompany\u2019s continued existence. Nor could we identify any risk interdependencies that could combine to\nendanger the company\u2019s continued existence.\nBased on our product portfolio, our know-how, and our innovation capability, we are confident that we can use\nthe opportunities resulting from our business practices and successfully master the challenges resulting from the\nrisks stated below.\nOpportunities and Risks in General and in the Company\u2019s Business Environment\nThe risks outlined below may have material effects on EBITDA and, in individual cases, the FOCF of our Group\nwithin the one-year forecast period. In this context, risks are deemed material if the potential loss to Covestro is\nestimated at \u20ac50 million or more and/or they have at least a moderate potential qualitative impact. The likelihood\nof occurrence of the risks is used for internal management purposes to define focus areas for the Corporate Risk\nCommittee. The risks are more highly aggregated in this report than in our internal documentation. Various\nindividual risks are combined into risk categories we have defined for this purpose. The following overview shows\nthe levels of risk allocated to the individual risks within each category. A risk category can therefore include more\nthan one weighted risk occurrence level. The order in which the risk categories are listed does not reflect their\nsignificance. Unless explicit information to the contrary is provided, the opportunities and risks described below\nalways refer to both segments of Covestro.\nFinancial opportunities and risks that affect neither EBITDA nor FOCF are presented separately at the end of the\nchapter.\n157 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nRisk management considers risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group\u2019s objectives by having a\nnegative impact on the existing business or strategic goals. They are included in our risk portfolio, which is in turn\nlinked to the material sustainability topics and the topics of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD).\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/tcfd22\nRisk categories by weighted risk occurrence\nBusiness Environment\nGeopolitical Tensions and Social Upheavals\nIn the year 2022, we saw geopolitical tensions between regional powers, whose effects included a decline in\nproduct demand, rising energy and raw material prices, and disruptions in the supply chains. There is great\ngeneral uncertainty about how existing trade conflicts and tensions will develop, including the associated\nmacroeconomic implications, which could also have an impact on Covestro\u2019s business situation.\nMarket Development\nGeneral economic conditions worldwide and, in particular, in the geographic regions in which Covestro operates\nare a significant factor affecting the company\u2019s earnings, since their effect on the industries in which Covestro\u2019s\ndirect and indirect customers operate affects demand for our company\u2019s products.\nNegative economic developments triggered by a variety of events may have a negative impact on the global\neconomy and international financial markets in general. As a rule, this also adversely affects the sales markets for\nour products, which then usually decreases Covestro\u2019s sales volumes and earnings. However, the extent of the\nimpact of economic developments on sales volumes and earnings also depends on capacity utilization rates in\nthe industry, which in turn depend on the balance between supply and demand for the industry\u2019s products.\nDownturns in demand lead to reduced sales volumes and, ultimately, to reduced capacity utilization, which\nnegatively impacts margins. Conversely, a positive economic environment characterized by growth and upward\ntrends normally leads to improved business success.\n158 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nCovestro\u2019s corporate governance is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles.\nCovestro places great importance on responsible corporate governance. This promise to shareholders, business\npartners, and our employees is based on our commitment to the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\nand Articles of Incorporation that reflect these standards. In pursuing our business activities, we follow company\nprinciples that exceed the requirements of the law and the GCGC. A key concern is combining business success\nwith environmental and social goals, so when making any business decision, we always consider the three\ndimensions of sustainability \u2013 people, planet, profit. The principles guiding our actions, which are also based on\nthese dimensions, are documented in six policies applicable throughout the Group. These provide our employees\nwith guidance in the areas of value creation; sustainability; innovation; employees; health, safety, environment,\nenergy, and quality (HSEQ); and compliance. The standards contained in these policies are mandatory for all\nemployees worldwide.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/sustainability/service-downloads/policies-commitments\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board provide information pertaining to corporate governance in the\nsections that follow, including a Declaration on Corporate Governance for Covestro AG pursuant to Section 289f\nand for the Covestro Group pursuant to Section 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

In doing so, it takes into account the\ninterests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. The Board of Management performs its duties\naccording to the law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Management\u2019s rules of procedure, and the\nrecommendations of the GCGC as stated in the Declaration of Conformity. It ensures compliance with the law\nand internal company policies, and works with the company\u2019s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.\nThe current rules of procedure of the Board of Management are available at: https://www.covestro.com/rulesofprocedure2022\nThe Board of Management defines the long-term goals and strategy for the company and sets forth the\nprinciples and policies for the resulting corporate policies. Furthermore, it coordinates and monitors the most\nimportant activities, defines the company\u2019s portfolio, develops and deploys managerial staff, allocates resources,\nand decides on the management and reporting of the Covestro Group. In this context, the Board of Management\nensures that both, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with social and environmental factors,\nand the ecological and social impact of the company\u2019s activities are systematically identified and assessed. In\naddition to the long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy also takes ecological and social goals into\naccount. Corporate planning incorporates appropriate financial and sustainability-related goals.\nDuring their period of service for Covestro, Board of Management members are subject to a comprehensive non-\ncompete clause. They are obligated to work in the company\u2019s interests at all times and may not pursue any\npersonal interests in making decisions for the company or take advantage of the company\u2019s business\nopportunities for themselves. All Board of Management members are required to disclose any conflicts of\ninterest to the Chair of the Supervisory Board\u2019s Human Resources Committee and the Board of Management\nChair, and inform the other Board of Management members of this fact. Other duties, particularly holding seats on\nSupervisory Boards or comparable governing bodies at companies outside the Group, may only be assumed with\nthe approval of the Supervisory Board.\nThe members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole. However,\nthe individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within the framework of\nthe decisions made by the full Board. The allocation of duties among the members of the Board of Management\nis defined in a written schedule appended to its rules of procedure and listed in the following table. The full Board\nof Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in cases where a decision of the\nfull Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of procedure of the Board of Management\ncontain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by the full Board.\nBoard of Management meetings are held regularly and are convened by the Chair of the Board of Management.\nAny member of the Board of Management may also request that a meeting be convened, notifying the other\nmembers of the matter for discussion. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the\nvotes cast, except where unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chair casts the deciding vote.\nAccording to the Board of Management\u2019s rules of procedure, the Chair bears particular responsibility for\nfunctional coordination of all Board of Management areas. The Chair represents the Board of Management as\nwell as Covestro AG and the Group in dealings with the public and other third parties.\n166 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCompliance\nCompliance Management System\nOur corporate conduct is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles. Compliance with\nlegal and regulatory requirements is integral to our operations. It is only in this manner that we can sustainably\nincrease the company\u2019s enterprise value and safeguard our reputation.\nCompliance Culture and Targets\nIn its Corporate Compliance Policy, Covestro has specified a Group-wide code of conduct that mandates\nfundamental principles and rules for all employees. This code of conduct details our commitment to fair\ncompetition, integrity in business dealings, the principles of sustainability and product stewardship, data\nprotection, upholding of foreign trade and insider dealing laws, the separation of business and private interests,\nproper record-keeping and transparent financial reporting, as well as to providing fair, respectful, and\nnondiscriminatory working conditions. These requirements apply within the company as well as to all interactions\nwith external partners and the general public. Our code of conduct provides a framework for all decisions by the\ncompany and our employees. The Corporate Compliance Policy is available on our intranet and on our website,\nand is part of an information packet distributed to new employees when they are hired.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/profile/procurement/sustainability-in-\nprocurement/supplier-code-of-conduct\nCovestro is aware that employees will likely embrace and exhibit integrity if managers are excellent role models.\nThe Board of Management states very clearly in its Corporate Compliance Policy for all staff that, above and\nbeyond any legal requirements, Covestro elects not to conduct any business activities that would violate our\nrules and that management staff is prohibited from instructing employees otherwise. In this way, management\ncontinuously fosters our compliance culture by, for example, regularly drawing employees\u2019 attention to\ncompliance topics and their significance to the company. At Covestro town hall meetings, for example, Board of\nManagement members regularly present recent compliance cases to employees and underscore the importance\nof complying with statutory requirements and internal regulations.\nSee \u201cCorporate Commitments.\u201d\nWe want to utilize our compliance management system in order to:\n\nWe have taken steps to meet our targets, including implementing an internal control system to ensure\ncompliance rules are followed. The insights gained from our annual evaluation of effectiveness are leveraged in\nour efforts to continually improve our compliance management system.\nSee \u201cInternal Control System to Ensure Compliance.\u201d\n183 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCompliance Organization\nThe Chief Compliance Officer is in charge of all compliance activities at Covestro, and in this function reports\ndirectly to the Board of Management. The corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function is the single\npoint of contact that coordinates Group-wide compliance activities. Chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\nof Covestro, the Compliance Committee is the Group\u2019s top-level decision-making body on these issues. The\nCommittee\u2019s responsibilities include the following: exercising a Group-wide compliance governance function,\ninitiating and approving compliance-related regulations, and approving the annual training plan. In the reporting\nperiod, the Compliance Committee met a total of four times. The suitability and effectiveness of compliance\nactivities are regularly reviewed by the Corporate Audit function in independent, objective audits.\nSee \u201cProcess-Independent Monitoring.\u201d\nData privacy is under the responsibility of the corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function and is\ncoordinated Group-wide. By defining controls and processes, the function works to ensure compliance with legal\nrequirements (in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) and legal judgments to protect\npersonal data of employees, as well as of business partners, media representatives, etc. Local Data Privacy\nOfficers have been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. They serve as local points of\ncontact for employees on all questions regarding data privacy. The Board of Management is informed regularly\nabout activities in the company relating to data privacy law.\nA local Compliance Officer has also been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. This\nperson serves as a local point of contact for employees on all questions regarding legally and ethically correct\nconduct in business situations. The country organizations also have local compliance committees.\nCommunications and Compliance\nCovestro systematically conducts training courses on compliance. Once focus areas have been specified, target\ngroups are defined for each content category and the employees (including managerial staff) are invited.\nCovestro expressly encourages its employees to openly address any doubts about proper conduct in business\nsituations and to solicit advice. We inform all employees whom they can contact if they have any doubts or\nquestions. Covestro has also set up a whistleblowing tool. Employees and third parties can report potential\ncompliance violations through a hotline accessible worldwide or use an online tool that also permits anonymous\nreports. In addition, employees can also report any compliance incidents to their supervisors or to the\nCompliance organization.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/management/compliance\nAn internal policy sets out the principles for handling compliance incidents at Covestro. All suspected\ncompliance incidents are recorded in a central database. Confirmed violations are evaluated, and organizational,\ndisciplinary, or legal measures are taken if necessary.\nCompliance incidents are regularly reported to the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the\nbusiness entities\u2019 management teams. Moreover, a current overview of incidents, including additional information\non various aspects and developments related to this topic, is published in a monthly Compliance Telegram on the\nintranet. This ensures a high degree of transparency for all employees.\nOn a quarterly basis, all companies document risks arising from pending or current legal or administrative\nproceedings. Relevant cases are reported on a regular basis to the Board of Management and to the Audit\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. The material legal risks are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nSee note 26 \u201cLegal Risks\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n184 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nDISCLOSURES ON SUSTAINABILITY\nREPORTING AND GRI INDEX\nCovestro aims to help protect the environment, conserve limited resources, advance society, and create value, all\nby firmly integrating sustainability into our Group strategy and management.\nOur sustainability reporting is based on recognized standards. We report on material topics and nonfinancial\nperformance indicators pursuant to Section 315 (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in our Group\nManagement Report and supplement this information with additional content, which meets the requirements of\nthe \u201cwith reference to\u201d reporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards\n(SRS); this option has been available since the year 2022. We voluntarily report the management approaches for\nmaterial topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). We plan to check whether the use of voluntary GRI reporting\nunder the \u201cin accordance with GRI\u201d option is appropriate against the backdrop of regulatory developments.\nNonfinancial Group Statement\nWe publish the nonfinancial Group statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with\nSections 289c through 289e HGB as an integrated part of the Group Management Report. The respective\nsections include the strategies we pursue in addressing environmental, labor, and social issues as well as\nprotecting human rights and fighting corruption and bribery, including the due diligence processes followed and\nmeasures implemented, as well as the outcomes of these strategies.\nWe applied the GRI standards as a framework for preparing the nonfinancial Group statement.\nKey topics relevant to the nonfinancial Group statement are identified in an internal process and in consideration\nof their significance and implementation within the company. The starting point for this is the materiality\nassessment and the material sustainability topics identified or updated as a result, i.e., the topics that are of\nmedium or high relevance to Covestro and on the aspects of which Covestro\u2019s business activities have a medium\nor high impact. The following table provides an overview of the key sustainability topics with an eye to the relevant\naspects and contains references to the specific sections in the Group Management Report. In order to identify\nand address current developments and sustainability-related opportunities and risks at an early stage, we also\nreview whether there are any new findings relevant to opportunity and risk management. No material risks have\nbeen identified in connection with Covestro\u2019s own business activities, business relationships, or products that\nhave or are very likely to have a severely negative impact on the nonfinancial aspects of the company\u2019s business.\nSee \u201cOpportunities and Risks Report.\u201d\n186 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nKey sustainability topics of the Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement (HGB)\nRelevant aspects in accordance with the\nKey topics of the Group\u2019s nonfinancial Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement (German Section reference in the Group\nstatement (German Commercial Code) Commercial Code) Management Report\n\"Strategy,\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, social matters \"Circular Economy,\u201c\nCircular economy \"Innovation.\u201c\n\"Strategy,\u201d\nClimate neutrality Environmental matters, social matters \"Management,\u201d\n\"Climate Neutrality.\u201d\n\"Management,\u201d\nSustainable R&D based innovation portfolio Environmental matters, social matters\n\"Innovation.\u201c\n\"Strategy,\u201d\nSustainable products & product\nEnvironmental matters, social matters \"Sustainable Products and Product\nstewardship\nStewardship.\u201d\nEmployer attractiveness Employee matters \"Employees.\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, fighting corruption \"Opportunities and Risks Report,\u201c\nCompliance\nand bribery, respect for human rights \"Compliance.\u201c\nEmployee matters, respect for human\nDiversity, equity & inclusion\nrights, social matters \"Employees.\u201c\nInclusive business Social matters \"Social Responsibility.\u201c\nHuman rights Respect for human rights, social matters \"Social Responsibility.\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, social matters,\nSustainability in sourcing fighting corruption and bribery, respect for \"Procurement,\u201c\nhuman rights \"Sustainability in the Supply Chain.\u201c\n\"Integrated Management System for\nEmployee matters, environmental matters, Health, Safety, Environment, Energy,\nHealth & safety\nsocial matters and Quality,\u201c\n\u201eHealth & Safety.\u201c\nAs an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial Group statement was audited by the\nfinancial statement auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany), as part of the audit\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements based on an expansion of the audit engagement.\nA nonfinancial statement or nonfinancial report does not have to be provided at this time for Covestro AG.\n187 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nFor economic activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen, we potentially make a substantial contribution to the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation for selected sites. However, we are not yet able at present to\nfully meet the stringent quality requirements (e.g., product-related lifecycle assessments [LCAs] that go beyond\nexternally certified methodology assessments) that the EU Taxonomy imposes on the evidence to be provided.\nDo No Significant Harm (DNSH)\nFor an activity to qualify as a substantial contribution to one environmental objective, the EU Taxonomy requires\nthat it does not cause significant harm to the five other environmental objectives. In connection with the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was conducted\nfor activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen at site level, using Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6,\n4.5, and 8.5. With regard to the environmental objective of sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources, a risk assessment was likewise performed to establish any possible environmental damage at site\nlevel. For the environmental objective of transition to a circular economy, no criteria had been defined for the\neconomic activity analyzed at the time of publication of this report. As a result, compliance is currently not bound\nby any criteria. The criteria for ensuring that no significant harm is done for the environmental objective of\npollution prevention and control were reviewed in two steps. Employees with the relevant professional expertise\nexamined compliance with the requirements for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation set out\nin Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation on climate change mitigation in connection\nwith the specified guidelines and regulations. At the same time, compliance with the emission values in\nconnection with the best available techniques (BATs) was verified for the sites at which products are\nmanufactured with which we make a substantial contribution to meeting the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation. Finally, a check was performed at site level to make sure that no significant harm is done to the\nenvironmental objective of protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nFor activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen, proof could be provided for the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation that no significant harm was done to the other five environmental objectives. The only\nexception is Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation for the environmental objective of\nclimate change mitigation due to interpretation uncertainty about the provision of evidence, especially in relation\nto subitem g. Taxonomy-eligible products that either do not make a substantial contribution to meeting the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation or cause significant harm to at least one environmental\nobjective are not classified as taxonomy-aligned.\nMinimum Safeguards\nArticle 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to establish processes and procedures to ensure\ncompliance with different rules and regulations. They relate in particular to human rights (including labor and\nconsumer rights), corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition. These requirements correspond to\nCovestro\u2019s culture, which we have made an integral part of our actions on the basis of existing Corporate\nCommitments, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and various Group regulations. To ensure compliance with all legal\nand Group-wide provisions, regulations, guidelines, and standards, including those relevant to the minimum\nsafeguards of the EU Taxonomy, we have implemented processes and controls (e.g., as part of the compliance\nmanagement system, the internal control system, or the integrated Health, Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality\nmanagement system).\nSee \u201cCorporate Policies,\u201d \u201cHealth and Safety,\u201d \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain,\u201d \u201cHuman Rights,\u201d \u201cCompliance,\u201d and note 26\n\u201cLegal Risks\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n189 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe review of the minimum safeguards for human rights relates to Covestro\u2019s overarching management\napproach to respecting human rights, and primarily to the risk analysis conducted as part of the human rights due\ndiligence. In addition to the company\u2019s own business activities, this also covers our direct suppliers. It also\nconsiders the upstream supply chain, especially if there are specific allegations. The comprehensive and ongoing\nrisk analysis covers all of Covestro\u2019s own sites, the supply chain, as well as the use phase and end-of-life of our\nproducts. Depending on the respective risk assessments, various measures are agreed with the suppliers, e.g.,\nsupplier assessments under the TfS initiative* or special human rights training.\nSee \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain\u201d and \u201cHuman Rights.\u201d\nIn addition, as part of the review to establish compliance with the minimum safeguards, we verified at Group level\nthat no final court judgments have been handed down against Covestro in connection with the above issues.\nAlthough no economic activities were reported as taxonomy-aligned in the year 2022, there are no indications\nbased on the review described above to suggest that Covestro does not meet the minimum safeguards under\nArticle 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nWe are planning further activities to be undertaken by our cross-functional Human Rights Task Force, such as\nadditional training for buyers, the completion of guidance for buyers with various measures for suppliers\nprioritized during the risk analysis, or the introduction of a Group-wide guideline on our human rights-related\nmanagement system.\nResult of the Alignment Check\nIn fiscal 2022, we did not identify any taxonomy-aligned economic activities associated with the environmental\nobjective of climate change mitigation.\nCalculation of Taxonomy KPIs\nWe calculate taxonomy KPIs and report on the nature of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic\nactivities in accordance with Article 10(3) and Article 11(3) of the Taxonomy Regulation. We are required to report\nthe share of turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) that are generated by\ntaxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned activities. The way in which we define and document these KPIs and run\nthe data queries for the calculations prevents double-counting amounts when allocating turnover, CapEx, and\nOpEx to our economic activities. Where data could not be definitively allocated or KPIs had to be split between\neconomic activities, we applied allocation models appropriate for the particular process to reflect the technical\ncircumstances in the KPI calculation. The taxonomy KPIs are determined with system support in processes\nestablished for the purpose. Validation steps are taken and the data is checked against the figures in the Group\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements to ensure the data is complete and correct. Controls in our Internal Control\nSystem are used to support the underlying systems and processes.\nSee \u201cMain Features of the Internal Control System.\u201d\nTurnover\nIn order to determine the turnover generated by Covestro from taxonomy-eligible economic activities, we\nallocated the relevant Covestro products to these activities. The corresponding turnover for fiscal 2022 was then\ncalculated for the identified products and a ratio derived using the Covestro Group\u2019s sales reported in the Income\nStatement (denominator). Turnover generated from the activity of high-efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and\npower from fossil gaseous fuels is calculated in the same way.\nSee \u201cCovestro Group Consolidated Income Statement.\u201d\n\nFinancial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities generally comprise primary financial liabilities and negative fair values of derivatives.\nIn subsequent periods, such nonderivative liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest\nmethod. The Covestro Group does not opt to measure financial liabilities at fair value, e.g., to avoid or minimize\naccounting mismatches.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has expired.\nNetting Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities in the context of master netting or similar agreements are netted and the\nnet amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position if the Covestro Group has a present\nlegal entitlement to offset the recognized amounts against one another and there is the intention to balance them\non a net basis or at the same time to settle the corresponding liability with realization of the asset.\nProvisions for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nWithin the Covestro Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and defined\nbenefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately\nadministered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual, or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been\npaid, the company has no further payment obligations. The regular contributions constitute expenses for the year\nin which they are due. As such, they are included in the functional cost items, and thus in EBIT. All other post-\nemployment benefit systems are defined benefit plans, which may be either unfunded, i.e., financed by provisions,\nor funded, i.e., financed through pension funds.\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligations and the resulting expense are calculated in accordance with\nIAS 19 (Employee Benefits) using the projected unit credit method. The future benefit obligations are valued by\nactuarial methods and spread over the entire employment period on the basis of specific assumptions regarding\nbeneficiary structure and the economic environment. These relate mainly to the discount rate, future salary and\npension increases, variations in health care costs, and mortality rates.\nThe discount rates used are calculated from the yields of high-quality corporate bond portfolios in specific\ncurrencies with cash flows approximately equivalent to the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The\nuniform discount rate derived from this interest rate structure is thus based on the yields, on the closing date, of a\nportfolio of corporate bonds with at least an AA or AAA rating whose weighted residual maturities approximately\ncorrespond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.\nThe fair value of plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation for pensions and\nother post-employment benefits to determine the net defined benefit liability. Plan assets in excess of the benefit\nobligation are reflected in other receivables, subject to the asset ceiling specified in IAS 19. Comprehensive\nactuarial valuations for all major plans are performed annually as of December 31.\nThe balance of all income and expenses relating to defined benefit plans, except the net interest on the net\nliability, is recognized in EBIT. The net interest is reflected in the financial result.\nThe effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in other comprehensive income.\nThey consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets, and changes in the effects of the asset\nceiling, less the respective amounts included in net interest for the last two components. Deferred taxes relating\nto the effects of remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.\n251 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Provisions\nOther provisions are measured in accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent\nAssets) or, where applicable, IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Where the cash outflow to settle an obligation is\nexpected to occur after one year, the provision is recognized at the present value of the expected cash outflow.\nClaims for reimbursements from third parties are separately recognized in other receivables if their realization is\nvirtually certain.\nIf the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the\ncorresponding amount and the resulting income generally recognized in the functional cost item(s) in which the\noriginal charge was recognized.\nTo enhance the information content of the estimates, certain provisions that could have a material effect on the\nnet assets, financial position, and results of operations are selected and tested for their sensitivity to changes in\nthe underlying parameters using sensitivity analysis. To reflect uncertainty about the likelihood of the assumed\nevents actually occurring, the impact of a five-percentage-point change in the probability of occurrence is\nexamined in each case.\nProvisions for environmental protection are recognized if future cash outflows are likely to be necessary to\nensure compliance with environmental regulations or to carry out remediation work based on an obligation, such\ncosts can be reliably estimated, and no future benefits are expected from such measures.\nEstimating the future costs of environmental protection and remediation involves many uncertainties, particularly\nwith regard to the status of laws, regulations, and the information available about conditions in the various\ncountries and at the individual sites. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in\nsimilar cases, the conclusions in expert opinions obtained for existing environmental programs, current costs,\nand new developments affecting these costs. Also taken into consideration are management\u2019s interpretation of\ncurrent environmental laws and regulations, the number and financial position of third parties that may become\nobligated to participate in any remediation costs on the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely\nto be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results.\nTaking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature,\nCovestro\u2019s management believes the existing provisions to be adequate based upon currently available\ninformation. Given the business environment in which the Covestro Group operates and the inherent difficulties in\naccurately estimating environmental liabilities, material additional costs beyond the amounts accrued may be\nincurred under certain circumstances. It may transpire during remediation work that additional expenditures are\nnecessary over an extended period and that these exceed existing provisions and cannot be reasonably\nestimated.\nProvisions for restructuring are based either on a legal or a constructive external obligation. They only cover\nexpenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are necessary for restructuring, and are not related to\nfuture business operations. Such expenses include severance payments to employees and compensation\npayments in respect of rented property that can no longer be used. Prior to recognition of this type of provision,\nthe associated assets are tested for impairment.\nRestructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of\nbusiness activities, leveraging of portfolio synergies, or fundamental reorganizations of business units. The\nrespective provisions are recognized when a detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up, resolved by the\nresponsible decision-making level of management, and communicated to the affected employees and/or their\nrepresentatives. Provisions for restructuring are generally recognized at the present value of future cash\noutflows.\nAs a company with international operations, the Covestro Group is exposed to numerous legal risks for which\nprovisions for litigation must be recognized under certain conditions \u2013 especially in the areas of product liability,\ncompetition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax law, environmental law, and compliance issues such as\ncorruption and export control.\n252 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nLitigation and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and\ncomplexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the jurisdiction in\nwhich each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. The outcomes of currently pending and future\nproceedings generally cannot be predicted. Judgment in court proceedings, regulatory decisions, or the\nconclusion of a settlement may result in the Covestro Group incurring charges for which no accounting\nmeasures have been taken for lack of reasonable estimate or which exceed established provisions and insurance\ncoverage.\nThe Covestro Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, and\nthe extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its Law, Intellectual Property &\nCompliance corporate function and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Covestro Group.\nWhere it is more likely than not that such litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably\nestimable, a provision for litigation is normally recognized in the amount of the present value of the expected\ncash outflows. Such provisions cover the estimated unavoidable payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural\ncosts, attorney costs, and the cost of potential settlements.\nIt is often impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the\nprobability that a potential outflow of resources will result from pending or future litigation. Due to the special\nnature of these litigation, provisions are generally not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of\npotential amounts or judgments have been issued, and not before at least a range of possible legal outcomes of\nsuch litigations can be determined. Provisions for legal defense costs are recognized if it is probable that material\ncosts will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the company\u2019s legal position and an outflow of\nresources can generally be expected.\nInternal and external legal counsels evaluate the current status of the material legal risks to the Covestro Group at\nthe end of each reporting period. The need to recognized or adjust a provision and the amount of the provision or\nadjustment are determined on this basis. Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nSee note 26 \u201cLegal Risks.\u201d\nPersonnel-related provisions are mainly those recorded for variable one-time payments, individual performance\nawards, long-service awards, severance payments in connection with early retirement arrangements, surpluses\non long-term accounts, and other personnel costs. Since January 1, 2022, calculation of the provision for short-\nterm variable compensation (\u201cCovestro Profit Sharing Plan\u201d, \u201cCovestro PSP\u201d) has been based not only on the\nachievement of financial performance indicators such as Earnings Before Interest , Taxes, Depreciation and\nAmortization (EBITDA), Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF), and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)\nabove Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), but also on a sustainability component measured on the basis\nof selected environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. In fiscal 2022, measurement was based on\nselected environmental criteria.\nObligations under share-based compensation programs that provide for awards payable in cash are also\nincluded in personnel-related provisions (\u201cPrisma\u201d). The compensation of the Board of Management of\nCovestro AG and of managerial employees includes cash compensation based on the share price that are\nearned with lock-up periods and are reflected in profit or loss as personnel expenses in line with the\nconsideration paid in the performance period. They are measured using a subscription price model at the time of\ngranting and at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment). In 2021, Prisma was\nexpanded to include a sustainability component that covers Covestro\u2019s target for reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions (CO equivalents, CO e).\n2 2\nMiscellaneous provisions include those for other liabilities, for product liability, for warranty, and insurance\npayments. Rebates to be granted to customers, on the other hand are reported under refund liabilities.\n253 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Receivables and Liabilities\nOther receivables are measured at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of\nthe asset.\nPending Transactions\nPending transactions relating to contributions in kind (\u201cexecutory contracts\u201d), i.e., agreements in relation to which\n(to a degree) neither the service nor the consideration has been rendered, are not recognized in the statement of\nfinancial position on the reporting date if there is no risk of a loss on the reporting date. If there is the risk of a loss,\nthis is generally anticipated in the form of provisions if all the other requirements are met. In contrast, gains\nanticipated from such agreements on the reporting date may not be recognized in the statement of financial\nposition. Examples of executory procurement contracts include contracts regarding the procurement of energy\nfor the operation of production facilities, which also includes what are known as power purchase agreements\n(PPA) for the procurement of power from renewable energy. In comparison, pending transactions in the area of\nthe application of the rules regarding financial instruments (financial derivatives) are to be recognized on the\nreporting date in the amount of the negative fair value if a loss is expected and in the amount of the positive fair\nvalue if a gain is expected.\n\n\nThe image is a diagram of a corporate risk management system, detailing the structure and flow of responsibilities within an organization. The system is layered to show different levels of oversight and operational functions related to risk management.

This ensures oversight and accountability.\n\n2. **Board of Management**:\n   - Directly below the Supervisory Board/Audit Committee, this layer has overall responsibility for handling material risks and opportunities within the group. It also ensures the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system.\n\n3. **Corporate Risk Committee**:\n   - This committee ensures a holistic overview of the organization\u2019s risk landscape. It functions under the Board of Management to aggregate and assess risk information from various parts of the organization.\n\n4. **Corporate Risk Management**:\n   - Positioned below the Corporate Risk Committee, this level is responsible for the creation and implementation of risk management guidelines and software. It also handles communication and reporting, process-integrated monitoring, and provides guidance on risk management.\n\n5. **Sub-committees with Risk Owners**:\n   - At the operational level, these sub-committees are involved in the hands-on management of risks. They perform functions such as risk identification, evaluation, and handling, ensuring that risks are managed effectively on the ground level.\n\n6. **Corporate Audit**:\n   - Shown at the base of the diagram, operating independently from the risk management processes to ensure unbiased monitoring of the entire risk management system.\n\nThe diagram uses arrows to indicate the flow of information and responsibility, emphasizing a comprehensive and structured approach to risk management that integrates oversight, management, and execution across different levels of the organization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short,precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

It\nreviewed the Board of Management\u2019s fixed compensation on a regular basis and considered the long-term\nvariable compensation for the Board of Management. The Board additionally discussed in detail the financial\nplanning for fiscal 2023 proposed by the Board of Management and the medium-term outlook also presented. It\napproved both the financial plan and the financing framework proposed for fiscal 2023. In this meeting, the\nSupervisory Board also planned the AGM to be held in the year 2023, discussing the agenda and proposed\nresolutions and approved the decision of the Board of Management to hold the 2023 AGM as a virtual meeting. In\nthis meeting, the Supervisory Board also voted to issue an unqualified declaration of conformity with the GCGC.\nCovestro AG Supervisory Board (as of December 31, 2022; from left to right):\nFirst row: Dr. Richard Pott, Petra Kronen, Dr. Christine Bortenl\u00e4nger, Dr. Christoph G\u00fcrtler\nSecond row: Lise Kingo, Irena K\u00fcstner, Frank L\u00f6llgen, Petra Reinbold-Knape\nThird row: Dr. Sven Schneider, Regine Stachelhaus, Marc Stothfang and Patrick Thomas\nCommittees of the Supervisory Board\nIn the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board had five permanent committees set up so that it can continue to\nexercise its duties effectively and efficiently. The committees prepared resolutions by the full Supervisory Board\nand provided information on other topics to be discussed by this body. Moreover, certain decision-making\npowers of the Supervisory Board were delegated to the committees to the extent legally permissible. The\nSupervisory Board currently has the following permanent committees: Presidial Committee, Audit Committee,\nHuman Resources Committee, Nominations Committee, and Sustainability Committee.\nThe tasks and responsibilities of the standing committees and their current composition are described in greater\ndetail in \u201cDeclaration on Corporate Governance\u201d under \u201cCommittees of the Supervisory Board\u201d in the Combined\nManagement Report.\nThe meetings and decisions of all committees, and especially those of the Audit and Sustainability Committees,\nwere prepared on the basis of reports and explanations provided by the Board of Management. The committee\nchairs regularly provided comprehensive reports on the work of the committees to the full Supervisory Board.\n24 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe Presidial Committee, on which shareholders and employees are equally represented, made preparations in\nthe year 2022 for the decisions relating to the qualification matrix required by the new GCGC and convened for a\nmeeting for this purpose on November 23, 2022. This followed the preparation by the Nomination Committee of\na proposed qualification matrix, including a review of and adjustments to the Supervisory Board\u2019s areas of skill.\nThe Audit Committee met a total of four times in the year under review: on February 21, May 2, July 25, and\nOctober 24, 2022, each time in the presence of the CFO. Three of these meetings were also attended by the\nauditor. The Audit Committee conducted a preparatory review of the Financial Statements of Covestro AG, the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Covestro Group, the Combined Management Report, and the proposal\nfor the use of the distributable profit for the Supervisory Board. Additionally, it also discussed in detail the\nrespective audit report and in particular, along with the oral report by the auditor on the material results of the\naudit. The Combined Management Report also included the Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement. In conducting its\nreview, the Audit Committee found no grounds for objections. It recommended to the Supervisory Board to\napprove the Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021 as well as to consent to\nthe Combined Management Report and the proposal for the use of the distributable profit. In addition, the Audit\nCommittee discussed with the Board of Management the half-year financial report in light of the results of the\nreview by the auditor, and the Q1 and Q3 2022 interim statements prior to their publication.\nThe Audit Committee monitored the accounting and financial reporting process and the appropriateness and\neffectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system,\nincluding sustainability-related aspects, and deliberated on the audit of the Financial Statements and compliance.\nIn doing so, the Committee received reports, including from the heads of Corporate Audit and the Corporate Law,\nIntellectual Property & Compliance functions and from the auditor. No material weaknesses were identified in the\ninternal control system for financial reporting purposes or the risk early warning system.\nThe Audit Committee additionally undertook preparations for the Supervisory Board\u2019s proposal for the\nappointment of the financial statement auditor by the AGM, the engagement of the auditor and agreement on the\nauditor\u2019s fee. It monitored the quality of the audit and the independence of the auditor as well as the\nsupplementary non-audit services provided in addition to the financial statement audit. In this context, the\ncommittee had the auditor confirm their independence.\nThe Audit Committee discussed the audit risk assessment, audit strategy, audit planning, key audit matters, and\naudit results with the auditor. The Chairman of the Audit Committee had regular feedback sessions with the\nauditor on the audit progress and reported on this to the Audit Committee.\nParticular topics discussed by the Audit Committee in the fiscal year under review were current and future\nregulatory requirements for sustainability reporting and their implementation, including especially the\nrequirements of the EU Taxonomy; the amendments to the GCGC; pension plan asset management; information\nsecurity; and cyber risk management. Furthermore, the Audit Committee obtained information on an ongoing\nbasis on enhancements to the compliance management system (particularly regarding anti-corruption\nmeasures), the handling of suspected compliance violations, progress in significant litigation, new legal and\nregulatory risks, and the risk situation, risk tracking, and risk monitoring in the Group. The Corporate Audit function\nprovided regular reports about risk assessments.\nThe heads of the relevant corporate functions also participated in meetings of the Audit Committee on selected\nagenda items, reported on these, and answered questions. In addition, the Chair of the Audit Committee\ndiscussed important matters between meetings, particularly with the Supervisory Board Chair, the CFO and the\nauditor. The key results of these discussions were reported regularly to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory\nBoard. The Audit Committee continued its practice of closed sessions in the year under review. They allow the\nauditor and the committee during the meeting to have a discussion without the Board of Management being\npresent.\n25 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nIn the reporting period, the Human Resources Committee met for a total of five meetings held on February 22,\nApril 21, June 9, September 28, and December 16, 2022. Topics of particular importance in connection with\nlong-term succession planning for the Board of Management in the past year also included the reappointment of\nthe CEO, Dr. Markus Steilemann, and the extension of his contract as well as succession planning for the CTO.\nThe CTO succession planning was on the agenda of the Human Resources Committee meetings in February,\nJune, and September.\nIn its first meeting on February 22, the committee discussed the CTO succession planning, as well as target\nattainment by the members of the Board of Management, long-term variable compensation of the Board of\nManagement, and adjustments to the description of the compensation system for the Board of Management.\nThe meetings on April 21 and June 9 focused on the reappointment of the CEO and the extension of his contract.\nIn the fourth meeting held on September 28, the Human Resources Committee dealt in particular with the\nreappointment of Dr. Klaus Sch\u00e4fer and the extension of his contract and the appointment of Dr. Thorsten Dreier\nas member of the Board of Management and successor to Dr. Sch\u00e4fer as of July 1, 2023. It also approved\nDr. Thomas Toepfer\u2019s membership of the Regional Advisory Council for the Central Region of Commerzbank AG.\nThe agenda of the meeting held on December 16 included the annual review of the appropriateness of Board of\nManagement compensation, long-term variable compensation of the Board of Management, and short-term\nvariable compensation for the current year.\nThe members of the Nomination Committee held a meeting on September 22 of the reporting year to discuss\nthe skills profile and the qualification matrix of the Supervisory Board required by the GCGC. The Nomination\nCommittee reviewed and added to the skills profile to meet the requirements of the new version of the GCGC. In\nthis meeting, the Nomination Committee also prepared the qualification matrix required by the GCGC, which was\nsubsequently processed further by the Presidial Committee.\nThe Sustainability Committee convened for a total of five meetings. In its first meeting on February 1, it dealt\nwith Covestro\u2019s path to climate neutrality (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and related proposals on objectives\nand implementation measures. The committee also discussed the EU\u2019s chemicals strategy and the approach\nadopted by Covestro in response. In its second meeting on March 30, the focus was on Scope 3 emissions and\nhow they relate to the circular economy. In the third meeting on June 7, the Scope 3/circular economy topic was\nraised again on the basis of examples from the market. In addition, discussions centered on ratings by external\nrating agencies on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, and the approach pursued by Covestro\nin this regard. Another topic at this meeting was the concept for the K plastics trade fair in October 2022, with a\nfocus on sustainable solutions and the circular economy. In the fourth meeting on September 9, the committee\ndiscussed the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring performance against targets. It also considered\nthe ESG aspect of \u201cCompliance with human rights\u201d and spent time on the topic of \u201cTransparency of our reporting\u201d\n(current forms of reporting at Covestro and future requirements, in particular in accordance with the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). The topics focused on at the fifth\nmeeting on November 25 included a progress update on ESG reporting, the 2022 materiality assessment, and\nthe annual planning of the topics of the Sustainability Committee for the year 2023.\n26 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nMANAGEMENT REPORT PROFILE\nCombined Management Report of the Covestro Group and Covestro AG\nThe Combined Management Report pertains to both the Covestro Group and Covestro AG. This report covers\nthe period from January 1 to December 31, 2022. The presentation of the results of operations, financial position,\nand net assets as well as the expected development, including the principal opportunities and risks, relate to the\nCovestro Group, unless otherwise noted. Information that applies to Covestro AG only is identified accordingly.\nThe results of operations, financial position, and net assets of Covestro AG are presented in a separate chapter\nof the Report on Economic Position. In addition, the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c\nin conjunction with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB is integrated into the Group Management Report.\nThis includes the statements in accordance with the European Union\u2019s Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).\nA nonfinancial statement in accordance with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB does not have to be\nprovided for Covestro AG.\nNonfinancial Reporting\nCovestro reports comprehensively and transparently about topics important from the company's perspective\nand for our stakeholders. We measure our sustainability performance using financial indicators as well as key\nnonfinancial indicators published in the Group Management Report. Our objective here is to highlight how closely\nlinked environmental and societal factors are with responsible corporate governance and the long-term success\nof our business. The Group Management Report and the supplementary sustainability information together\ncomprise our annual sustainability reporting. We supplement the nonfinancial information in the Group\nManagement Report by reporting additional content, which meets the requirements of the \u201cwith reference to GRI\u201d\nreporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) and is identified\nseparately.\nFor all reportable aspects, the nonfinancial statement includes the policies we pursue in addressing\nenvironmental matters, employee matters, and social matters as well as respect for human rights and anti-\ncorruption and bribery matters, the due diligence processes followed, as well as the outcomes of these\nstrategies. Nonfinancial performance indicators are reported only when these are important to the Covestro\nGroup.\nAs an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial statement was audited with reasonable\nassurance by our auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany). The supplementary\nsustainability information specifically identified as such additionally contributes to the transparency of our\nreporting, which meets the requirements of the \u201cwith reference to GRI\u201d reporting option of the Global Reporting\nInitiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS). We voluntarily report the management approaches for\nmaterial topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). The supplementary sustainability information that is not part of\nour statutory audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements was subjected to a separate review with limited\nassurance pursuant to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 by KPMG AG\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany).\nEnvironmental Performance Indicators\nEnvironmental protection performance indicators are reported for all fully consolidated companies. Since these\nfigures are calculated only at the end of the year, they include the group of companies consolidated as it stands\nat year-end. In this process, we incorporate data from all environmentally relevant Covestro sites, i.e., all\nproduction sites and relevant administrative sites. This data is used in addition to the environmental reporting\ncontained in this report to communicate with various stakeholders, e.g., associations, the press, and government\nagencies, as well as to continually improve our environmental performance. In order to comply with publication\ndeadlines, the sites estimate the environmental data for the final weeks of the current fiscal year on the basis of\nestablished estimation methodologies that ensure accurate reporting of data as close as possible to the actual\nfigures for the year. If, however, in the course of the following year, we become aware of material deviations based\non internally defined thresholds, the figures in question are corrected retroactively. This was not required in fiscal\n2022 for the preceding fiscal year 2021.\n32 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe reporting of direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, e.g., from burning fossil energy sources and from our\nproduction processes (Scope 1), of indirect GHG emissions from the provision and use of energy produced\noutside the company (Scope 2), and of GHG emissions from upstream and downstream processes in the value\nchain (Scope 3), is based on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes all fully consolidated\ncompanies. If, in our efforts to achieve climate neutrality, measures are taken to offset emissions in relation to our\nScope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, they are disclosed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The\nglobal warming potential (GWP) factors correspond to the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nAlternative Performance Measures\nThroughout its financial reporting, Covestro uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to assess the\nbusiness performance of the Group. These are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRSs) adopted by the European Union (EU). These non-IFRS indicators should be considered a supplement to,\nnot a replacement for, the financial performance measures determined in accordance with IFRSs. The alternative\nperformance measures of relevance to the Covestro Group include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,\nand amortization (EBITDA), return on capital employed (ROCE), free operating cash flow (FOCF), and net financial\ndebt. The calculation methods for the APMs may vary from those of other companies, thus limiting the extent of\nthe overall comparability. These alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation or employed\nas an alternative to the financial indicators determined in accordance with IFRSs and presented in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for purposes of assessing Covestro\u2019s results of operations, financial position,\nand net assets.\nExplanations of the definition and calculation of these alternative performance measures can be found in the \u201cManagement\u201d section.\n33 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nInternal Control System to Ensure Compliance\nCompliance risks are systematically identified and assessed as part of Covestro\u2019s Group-wide risk management.\nRisk owners assess the compliance risks that have been identified. A risk matrix is used to define focal points of\ncompliance tasks at Covestro. The findings of a risk-based analysis enabled Covestro to identify four key topics:\nantitrust law, corruption, data protection, and foreign trade law. The General Counsel/Chief Compliance Officer is\nthe risk owner responsible for breaches of antitrust law and corruption, while the Global Export Control Officer\noversees the risk of breaches of foreign trade law, and the Group Data Protection Officer is assigned to handling\nthe risk of loss and improper handling of personal data. With respect to corruption, areas including gifts and\ninvitations, relationships with government officials, and relationships with certain business partners such as sales\nagents were identified as being especially risk-relevant. A corruption risk analysis was performed in the year\nunder review for all companies in which Covestro holds a majority interest. If the risk profile changes, new\ncontrols are implemented if needed.\nMany controls have been implemented at both the global and local levels to reduce the number of compliance\nrisks. To the extent possible, we integrate the compliance controls into our internal control system. The\neffectiveness of the compliance controls is evaluated on the basis of a cascaded self-assessment system, as are\nthe ICS processes for accounting and financial reporting. The results of the effectiveness evaluations are\ndocumented in the global system for the ICS processes. The Corporate Audit function regularly reviews the\ncompliance activities in independent, objective audits as part of dedicated compliance checks in the larger\ncompanies. In the smaller companies, compliance aspects are part of a general review.\nRisk Management System\nCovestro has implemented a structured risk management process for the early identification of any potentially\ndisadvantageous developments that could have a material impact on our business or endanger the continued\nexistence of the company. This process satisfies the legal requirements regarding an early warning system for\nrisks pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, and is aligned with the\ninternational risk management standard COSO II Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrated Framework (2004).\nRisk management system\n155 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCorporate Risk Management defines, coordinates, and monitors the framework and standards for this risk\nmanagement system, ensuring adequate risk communication and reporting to both management and the risk\nmanagers. Covestro uses risk management software that simplifies the aggregation of risks, provides displays of\nvarious interdependencies, and compares individual risks to the risk bearing capacity.\nRisks are identified, evaluated, and controlled in the operating divisions and corporate functions by the respective\nrisk managers, who are organized in various global sub-committees. The Covestro Corporate Risk Committee\nmet three times in fiscal 2022 to review the risk landscape as well as the various risk management and monitoring\nmechanisms that are in place, and to take any necessary measures. Additionally, we conduct an ad-hoc process\nfor newly identified risks throughout the year so that these are immediately incorporated into the risk\nmanagement system. These ad-hoc risks are identified and their handling is determined based on risk\nassessments and depending on the defined thresholds. In addition, the Corporate Audit function complements\nthe monitoring process with process-independent monitoring.\nFinancial risks are evaluated using estimates of the potential impact after taking into account countermeasures\nand the likelihood of their occurrence. The potential economic losses are projected using the expected EBITDA\nloss and, in some individual cases, the FOCF loss. All material risks and the respective countermeasures are\ndocumented in the risk management software, which is used throughout the Group. The risk management\nsystem is reviewed regularly over the course of the year. Significant changes must be promptly entered in the\nsoftware and reported to the Board of Management. In addition, a report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the\nAudit Committee several times a year and to the Supervisory Board at least once a year.\nNonfinancial risks associated with our own business activities, business relations, or products are also recorded.\nThe extent of losses associated with these risks is evaluated on a quantitative and/or qualitative basis. In\nquantitative evaluation, any potential EBITDA loss is estimated. This also takes into consideration any\ncountermeasures that have a mitigating effect on the potential extent of losses or the probability of the risk. A\nqualitative assessment of the impact is made on the basis of criteria such as strategic effect, influence on our\nreputation, or possible loss of confidence among groups of stakeholders.\nThe following matrix illustrates the quantitative and qualitative criteria for rating a risk as high, medium, or low. The\nsame applies to the classification of nonfinancial risks.\nRating matrix\n1 An individual risk that could have both a direct financial and an indirect financial impact of different severities is always classified based on the higher level of risk.\n156 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nProcess-Independent Monitoring\nThe effectiveness of our management systems is evaluated at regular intervals by the Corporate Audit function,\nwhich performs an independent and objective audit focused on verifying compliance with laws and policies.\nCorporate Audit also supports the company in achieving its goals by systematically evaluating the efficiency and\neffectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes and helping to improve them. This\nincludes internal monitoring of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk\nmanagement system. The selection of audit targets follows a risk-based approach. Corporate Audit performs its\nduties according to internationally recognized standards. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee is regularly\ninformed about the results of audits and also receives an annual report on the internal control system and its\neffectiveness.\nRisks in the areas of occupational health and safety, plant safety, environmental protection, and product quality\nare assessed through specific health, safety, environment, energy, and quality (HSEQ) audits.\nThe external auditor assesses the early warning system for risks as part of its audit of the financial statements,\nfocusing on whether the system is fundamentally suitable for identifying at an early stage any risks that could\nendanger the company\u2019s continued existence so that suitable countermeasures can be taken. The auditor also\nreports at regular intervals to Covestro AG\u2019s Board of Management and the Audit Committee as well as the\nSupervisory Board on the results of the audit and any weaknesses identified in the internal control system. Audit\noutcomes are also taken into account in the continuous improvement of our management processes.\nOpportunities and Risks\nOverall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks\nParticularly in the year 2022, Covestro\u2019s business environment was severely affected by geopolitical events, such\nas the Russian war against Ukraine, a rise in inflation trends around the world, higher energy and raw material\nprices, disrupted global supply chains, and the global acceleration in recessionary trends. However, the overall\nopportunity and risk position of the Group, has not changed significantly compared to the previous year. The\nlatest assessment of financial and nonfinancial risks shows that none of the risks reported below endanger the\ncompany\u2019s continued existence. Nor could we identify any risk interdependencies that could combine to\nendanger the company\u2019s continued existence.\nBased on our product portfolio, our know-how, and our innovation capability, we are confident that we can use\nthe opportunities resulting from our business practices and successfully master the challenges resulting from the\nrisks stated below.\nOpportunities and Risks in General and in the Company\u2019s Business Environment\nThe risks outlined below may have material effects on EBITDA and, in individual cases, the FOCF of our Group\nwithin the one-year forecast period. In this context, risks are deemed material if the potential loss to Covestro is\nestimated at \u20ac50 million or more and/or they have at least a moderate potential qualitative impact. The likelihood\nof occurrence of the risks is used for internal management purposes to define focus areas for the Corporate Risk\nCommittee. The risks are more highly aggregated in this report than in our internal documentation. Various\nindividual risks are combined into risk categories we have defined for this purpose. The following overview shows\nthe levels of risk allocated to the individual risks within each category. A risk category can therefore include more\nthan one weighted risk occurrence level. The order in which the risk categories are listed does not reflect their\nsignificance. Unless explicit information to the contrary is provided, the opportunities and risks described below\nalways refer to both segments of Covestro.\nFinancial opportunities and risks that affect neither EBITDA nor FOCF are presented separately at the end of the\nchapter.\n157 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nRisk management considers risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group\u2019s objectives by having a\nnegative impact on the existing business or strategic goals. They are included in our risk portfolio, which is in turn\nlinked to the material sustainability topics and the topics of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD).\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/tcfd22\nRisk categories by weighted risk occurrence\nBusiness Environment\nGeopolitical Tensions and Social Upheavals\nIn the year 2022, we saw geopolitical tensions between regional powers, whose effects included a decline in\nproduct demand, rising energy and raw material prices, and disruptions in the supply chains. There is great\ngeneral uncertainty about how existing trade conflicts and tensions will develop, including the associated\nmacroeconomic implications, which could also have an impact on Covestro\u2019s business situation.\nMarket Development\nGeneral economic conditions worldwide and, in particular, in the geographic regions in which Covestro operates\nare a significant factor affecting the company\u2019s earnings, since their effect on the industries in which Covestro\u2019s\ndirect and indirect customers operate affects demand for our company\u2019s products.\nNegative economic developments triggered by a variety of events may have a negative impact on the global\neconomy and international financial markets in general. As a rule, this also adversely affects the sales markets for\nour products, which then usually decreases Covestro\u2019s sales volumes and earnings. However, the extent of the\nimpact of economic developments on sales volumes and earnings also depends on capacity utilization rates in\nthe industry, which in turn depend on the balance between supply and demand for the industry\u2019s products.\nDownturns in demand lead to reduced sales volumes and, ultimately, to reduced capacity utilization, which\nnegatively impacts margins. Conversely, a positive economic environment characterized by growth and upward\ntrends normally leads to improved business success.\n158 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nCovestro\u2019s corporate governance is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles.\nCovestro places great importance on responsible corporate governance. This promise to shareholders, business\npartners, and our employees is based on our commitment to the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\nand Articles of Incorporation that reflect these standards. In pursuing our business activities, we follow company\nprinciples that exceed the requirements of the law and the GCGC. A key concern is combining business success\nwith environmental and social goals, so when making any business decision, we always consider the three\ndimensions of sustainability \u2013 people, planet, profit. The principles guiding our actions, which are also based on\nthese dimensions, are documented in six policies applicable throughout the Group. These provide our employees\nwith guidance in the areas of value creation; sustainability; innovation; employees; health, safety, environment,\nenergy, and quality (HSEQ); and compliance. The standards contained in these policies are mandatory for all\nemployees worldwide.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/sustainability/service-downloads/policies-commitments\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board provide information pertaining to corporate governance in the\nsections that follow, including a Declaration on Corporate Governance for Covestro AG pursuant to Section 289f\nand for the Covestro Group pursuant to Section 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

In doing so, it takes into account the\ninterests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. The Board of Management performs its duties\naccording to the law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Management\u2019s rules of procedure, and the\nrecommendations of the GCGC as stated in the Declaration of Conformity. It ensures compliance with the law\nand internal company policies, and works with the company\u2019s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.\nThe current rules of procedure of the Board of Management are available at: https://www.covestro.com/rulesofprocedure2022\nThe Board of Management defines the long-term goals and strategy for the company and sets forth the\nprinciples and policies for the resulting corporate policies. Furthermore, it coordinates and monitors the most\nimportant activities, defines the company\u2019s portfolio, develops and deploys managerial staff, allocates resources,\nand decides on the management and reporting of the Covestro Group. In this context, the Board of Management\nensures that both, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with social and environmental factors,\nand the ecological and social impact of the company\u2019s activities are systematically identified and assessed. In\naddition to the long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy also takes ecological and social goals into\naccount. Corporate planning incorporates appropriate financial and sustainability-related goals.\nDuring their period of service for Covestro, Board of Management members are subject to a comprehensive non-\ncompete clause. They are obligated to work in the company\u2019s interests at all times and may not pursue any\npersonal interests in making decisions for the company or take advantage of the company\u2019s business\nopportunities for themselves. All Board of Management members are required to disclose any conflicts of\ninterest to the Chair of the Supervisory Board\u2019s Human Resources Committee and the Board of Management\nChair, and inform the other Board of Management members of this fact. Other duties, particularly holding seats on\nSupervisory Boards or comparable governing bodies at companies outside the Group, may only be assumed with\nthe approval of the Supervisory Board.\nThe members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole. However,\nthe individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within the framework of\nthe decisions made by the full Board. The allocation of duties among the members of the Board of Management\nis defined in a written schedule appended to its rules of procedure and listed in the following table. The full Board\nof Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in cases where a decision of the\nfull Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of procedure of the Board of Management\ncontain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by the full Board.\nBoard of Management meetings are held regularly and are convened by the Chair of the Board of Management.\nAny member of the Board of Management may also request that a meeting be convened, notifying the other\nmembers of the matter for discussion. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the\nvotes cast, except where unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chair casts the deciding vote.\nAccording to the Board of Management\u2019s rules of procedure, the Chair bears particular responsibility for\nfunctional coordination of all Board of Management areas. The Chair represents the Board of Management as\nwell as Covestro AG and the Group in dealings with the public and other third parties.\n166 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCompliance\nCompliance Management System\nOur corporate conduct is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles. Compliance with\nlegal and regulatory requirements is integral to our operations. It is only in this manner that we can sustainably\nincrease the company\u2019s enterprise value and safeguard our reputation.\nCompliance Culture and Targets\nIn its Corporate Compliance Policy, Covestro has specified a Group-wide code of conduct that mandates\nfundamental principles and rules for all employees. This code of conduct details our commitment to fair\ncompetition, integrity in business dealings, the principles of sustainability and product stewardship, data\nprotection, upholding of foreign trade and insider dealing laws, the separation of business and private interests,\nproper record-keeping and transparent financial reporting, as well as to providing fair, respectful, and\nnondiscriminatory working conditions. These requirements apply within the company as well as to all interactions\nwith external partners and the general public. Our code of conduct provides a framework for all decisions by the\ncompany and our employees. The Corporate Compliance Policy is available on our intranet and on our website,\nand is part of an information packet distributed to new employees when they are hired.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/profile/procurement/sustainability-in-\nprocurement/supplier-code-of-conduct\nCovestro is aware that employees will likely embrace and exhibit integrity if managers are excellent role models.\nThe Board of Management states very clearly in its Corporate Compliance Policy for all staff that, above and\nbeyond any legal requirements, Covestro elects not to conduct any business activities that would violate our\nrules and that management staff is prohibited from instructing employees otherwise. In this way, management\ncontinuously fosters our compliance culture by, for example, regularly drawing employees\u2019 attention to\ncompliance topics and their significance to the company. At Covestro town hall meetings, for example, Board of\nManagement members regularly present recent compliance cases to employees and underscore the importance\nof complying with statutory requirements and internal regulations.\nSee \u201cCorporate Commitments.\u201d\nWe want to utilize our compliance management system in order to:\n\nWe have taken steps to meet our targets, including implementing an internal control system to ensure\ncompliance rules are followed. The insights gained from our annual evaluation of effectiveness are leveraged in\nour efforts to continually improve our compliance management system.\nSee \u201cInternal Control System to Ensure Compliance.\u201d\n183 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nCompliance Organization\nThe Chief Compliance Officer is in charge of all compliance activities at Covestro, and in this function reports\ndirectly to the Board of Management. The corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function is the single\npoint of contact that coordinates Group-wide compliance activities. Chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\nof Covestro, the Compliance Committee is the Group\u2019s top-level decision-making body on these issues. The\nCommittee\u2019s responsibilities include the following: exercising a Group-wide compliance governance function,\ninitiating and approving compliance-related regulations, and approving the annual training plan. In the reporting\nperiod, the Compliance Committee met a total of four times. The suitability and effectiveness of compliance\nactivities are regularly reviewed by the Corporate Audit function in independent, objective audits.\nSee \u201cProcess-Independent Monitoring.\u201d\nData privacy is under the responsibility of the corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function and is\ncoordinated Group-wide. By defining controls and processes, the function works to ensure compliance with legal\nrequirements (in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) and legal judgments to protect\npersonal data of employees, as well as of business partners, media representatives, etc. Local Data Privacy\nOfficers have been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. They serve as local points of\ncontact for employees on all questions regarding data privacy. The Board of Management is informed regularly\nabout activities in the company relating to data privacy law.\nA local Compliance Officer has also been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. This\nperson serves as a local point of contact for employees on all questions regarding legally and ethically correct\nconduct in business situations. The country organizations also have local compliance committees.\nCommunications and Compliance\nCovestro systematically conducts training courses on compliance. Once focus areas have been specified, target\ngroups are defined for each content category and the employees (including managerial staff) are invited.\nCovestro expressly encourages its employees to openly address any doubts about proper conduct in business\nsituations and to solicit advice. We inform all employees whom they can contact if they have any doubts or\nquestions. Covestro has also set up a whistleblowing tool. Employees and third parties can report potential\ncompliance violations through a hotline accessible worldwide or use an online tool that also permits anonymous\nreports. In addition, employees can also report any compliance incidents to their supervisors or to the\nCompliance organization.\nAdditional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/management/compliance\nAn internal policy sets out the principles for handling compliance incidents at Covestro. All suspected\ncompliance incidents are recorded in a central database. Confirmed violations are evaluated, and organizational,\ndisciplinary, or legal measures are taken if necessary.\nCompliance incidents are regularly reported to the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the\nbusiness entities\u2019 management teams. Moreover, a current overview of incidents, including additional information\non various aspects and developments related to this topic, is published in a monthly Compliance Telegram on the\nintranet. This ensures a high degree of transparency for all employees.\nOn a quarterly basis, all companies document risks arising from pending or current legal or administrative\nproceedings. Relevant cases are reported on a regular basis to the Board of Management and to the Audit\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. The material legal risks are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nSee note 26 \u201cLegal Risks\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n184 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nDISCLOSURES ON SUSTAINABILITY\nREPORTING AND GRI INDEX\nCovestro aims to help protect the environment, conserve limited resources, advance society, and create value, all\nby firmly integrating sustainability into our Group strategy and management.\nOur sustainability reporting is based on recognized standards. We report on material topics and nonfinancial\nperformance indicators pursuant to Section 315 (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in our Group\nManagement Report and supplement this information with additional content, which meets the requirements of\nthe \u201cwith reference to\u201d reporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards\n(SRS); this option has been available since the year 2022. We voluntarily report the management approaches for\nmaterial topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). We plan to check whether the use of voluntary GRI reporting\nunder the \u201cin accordance with GRI\u201d option is appropriate against the backdrop of regulatory developments.\nNonfinancial Group Statement\nWe publish the nonfinancial Group statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with\nSections 289c through 289e HGB as an integrated part of the Group Management Report. The respective\nsections include the strategies we pursue in addressing environmental, labor, and social issues as well as\nprotecting human rights and fighting corruption and bribery, including the due diligence processes followed and\nmeasures implemented, as well as the outcomes of these strategies.\nWe applied the GRI standards as a framework for preparing the nonfinancial Group statement.\nKey topics relevant to the nonfinancial Group statement are identified in an internal process and in consideration\nof their significance and implementation within the company. The starting point for this is the materiality\nassessment and the material sustainability topics identified or updated as a result, i.e., the topics that are of\nmedium or high relevance to Covestro and on the aspects of which Covestro\u2019s business activities have a medium\nor high impact. The following table provides an overview of the key sustainability topics with an eye to the relevant\naspects and contains references to the specific sections in the Group Management Report. In order to identify\nand address current developments and sustainability-related opportunities and risks at an early stage, we also\nreview whether there are any new findings relevant to opportunity and risk management. No material risks have\nbeen identified in connection with Covestro\u2019s own business activities, business relationships, or products that\nhave or are very likely to have a severely negative impact on the nonfinancial aspects of the company\u2019s business.\nSee \u201cOpportunities and Risks Report.\u201d\n186 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nKey sustainability topics of the Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement (HGB)\nRelevant aspects in accordance with the\nKey topics of the Group\u2019s nonfinancial Group\u2019s nonfinancial statement (German Section reference in the Group\nstatement (German Commercial Code) Commercial Code) Management Report\n\"Strategy,\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, social matters \"Circular Economy,\u201c\nCircular economy \"Innovation.\u201c\n\"Strategy,\u201d\nClimate neutrality Environmental matters, social matters \"Management,\u201d\n\"Climate Neutrality.\u201d\n\"Management,\u201d\nSustainable R&D based innovation portfolio Environmental matters, social matters\n\"Innovation.\u201c\n\"Strategy,\u201d\nSustainable products & product\nEnvironmental matters, social matters \"Sustainable Products and Product\nstewardship\nStewardship.\u201d\nEmployer attractiveness Employee matters \"Employees.\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, fighting corruption \"Opportunities and Risks Report,\u201c\nCompliance\nand bribery, respect for human rights \"Compliance.\u201c\nEmployee matters, respect for human\nDiversity, equity & inclusion\nrights, social matters \"Employees.\u201c\nInclusive business Social matters \"Social Responsibility.\u201c\nHuman rights Respect for human rights, social matters \"Social Responsibility.\u201c\nEnvironmental matters, social matters,\nSustainability in sourcing fighting corruption and bribery, respect for \"Procurement,\u201c\nhuman rights \"Sustainability in the Supply Chain.\u201c\n\"Integrated Management System for\nEmployee matters, environmental matters, Health, Safety, Environment, Energy,\nHealth & safety\nsocial matters and Quality,\u201c\n\u201eHealth & Safety.\u201c\nAs an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial Group statement was audited by the\nfinancial statement auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany), as part of the audit\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements based on an expansion of the audit engagement.\nA nonfinancial statement or nonfinancial report does not have to be provided at this time for Covestro AG.\n187 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nFor economic activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen, we potentially make a substantial contribution to the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation for selected sites. However, we are not yet able at present to\nfully meet the stringent quality requirements (e.g., product-related lifecycle assessments [LCAs] that go beyond\nexternally certified methodology assessments) that the EU Taxonomy imposes on the evidence to be provided.\nDo No Significant Harm (DNSH)\nFor an activity to qualify as a substantial contribution to one environmental objective, the EU Taxonomy requires\nthat it does not cause significant harm to the five other environmental objectives. In connection with the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was conducted\nfor activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen at site level, using Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6,\n4.5, and 8.5. With regard to the environmental objective of sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources, a risk assessment was likewise performed to establish any possible environmental damage at site\nlevel. For the environmental objective of transition to a circular economy, no criteria had been defined for the\neconomic activity analyzed at the time of publication of this report. As a result, compliance is currently not bound\nby any criteria. The criteria for ensuring that no significant harm is done for the environmental objective of\npollution prevention and control were reviewed in two steps. Employees with the relevant professional expertise\nexamined compliance with the requirements for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation set out\nin Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation on climate change mitigation in connection\nwith the specified guidelines and regulations. At the same time, compliance with the emission values in\nconnection with the best available techniques (BATs) was verified for the sites at which products are\nmanufactured with which we make a substantial contribution to meeting the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation. Finally, a check was performed at site level to make sure that no significant harm is done to the\nenvironmental objective of protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nFor activity 3.10 \u2013 Manufacture of hydrogen, proof could be provided for the environmental objective of climate\nchange mitigation that no significant harm was done to the other five environmental objectives. The only\nexception is Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation for the environmental objective of\nclimate change mitigation due to interpretation uncertainty about the provision of evidence, especially in relation\nto subitem g. Taxonomy-eligible products that either do not make a substantial contribution to meeting the\nenvironmental objective of climate change mitigation or cause significant harm to at least one environmental\nobjective are not classified as taxonomy-aligned.\nMinimum Safeguards\nArticle 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to establish processes and procedures to ensure\ncompliance with different rules and regulations. They relate in particular to human rights (including labor and\nconsumer rights), corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition. These requirements correspond to\nCovestro\u2019s culture, which we have made an integral part of our actions on the basis of existing Corporate\nCommitments, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and various Group regulations. To ensure compliance with all legal\nand Group-wide provisions, regulations, guidelines, and standards, including those relevant to the minimum\nsafeguards of the EU Taxonomy, we have implemented processes and controls (e.g., as part of the compliance\nmanagement system, the internal control system, or the integrated Health, Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality\nmanagement system).\nSee \u201cCorporate Policies,\u201d \u201cHealth and Safety,\u201d \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain,\u201d \u201cHuman Rights,\u201d \u201cCompliance,\u201d and note 26\n\u201cLegal Risks\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n189 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nThe review of the minimum safeguards for human rights relates to Covestro\u2019s overarching management\napproach to respecting human rights, and primarily to the risk analysis conducted as part of the human rights due\ndiligence. In addition to the company\u2019s own business activities, this also covers our direct suppliers. It also\nconsiders the upstream supply chain, especially if there are specific allegations. The comprehensive and ongoing\nrisk analysis covers all of Covestro\u2019s own sites, the supply chain, as well as the use phase and end-of-life of our\nproducts. Depending on the respective risk assessments, various measures are agreed with the suppliers, e.g.,\nsupplier assessments under the TfS initiative* or special human rights training.\nSee \u201cSustainability in the Supply Chain\u201d and \u201cHuman Rights.\u201d\nIn addition, as part of the review to establish compliance with the minimum safeguards, we verified at Group level\nthat no final court judgments have been handed down against Covestro in connection with the above issues.\nAlthough no economic activities were reported as taxonomy-aligned in the year 2022, there are no indications\nbased on the review described above to suggest that Covestro does not meet the minimum safeguards under\nArticle 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nWe are planning further activities to be undertaken by our cross-functional Human Rights Task Force, such as\nadditional training for buyers, the completion of guidance for buyers with various measures for suppliers\nprioritized during the risk analysis, or the introduction of a Group-wide guideline on our human rights-related\nmanagement system.\nResult of the Alignment Check\nIn fiscal 2022, we did not identify any taxonomy-aligned economic activities associated with the environmental\nobjective of climate change mitigation.\nCalculation of Taxonomy KPIs\nWe calculate taxonomy KPIs and report on the nature of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic\nactivities in accordance with Article 10(3) and Article 11(3) of the Taxonomy Regulation. We are required to report\nthe share of turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) that are generated by\ntaxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned activities. The way in which we define and document these KPIs and run\nthe data queries for the calculations prevents double-counting amounts when allocating turnover, CapEx, and\nOpEx to our economic activities. Where data could not be definitively allocated or KPIs had to be split between\neconomic activities, we applied allocation models appropriate for the particular process to reflect the technical\ncircumstances in the KPI calculation. The taxonomy KPIs are determined with system support in processes\nestablished for the purpose. Validation steps are taken and the data is checked against the figures in the Group\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements to ensure the data is complete and correct. Controls in our Internal Control\nSystem are used to support the underlying systems and processes.\nSee \u201cMain Features of the Internal Control System.\u201d\nTurnover\nIn order to determine the turnover generated by Covestro from taxonomy-eligible economic activities, we\nallocated the relevant Covestro products to these activities. The corresponding turnover for fiscal 2022 was then\ncalculated for the identified products and a ratio derived using the Covestro Group\u2019s sales reported in the Income\nStatement (denominator). Turnover generated from the activity of high-efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and\npower from fossil gaseous fuels is calculated in the same way.\nSee \u201cCovestro Group Consolidated Income Statement.\u201d\n\nFinancial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities generally comprise primary financial liabilities and negative fair values of derivatives.\nIn subsequent periods, such nonderivative liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest\nmethod. The Covestro Group does not opt to measure financial liabilities at fair value, e.g., to avoid or minimize\naccounting mismatches.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has expired.\nNetting Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities in the context of master netting or similar agreements are netted and the\nnet amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position if the Covestro Group has a present\nlegal entitlement to offset the recognized amounts against one another and there is the intention to balance them\non a net basis or at the same time to settle the corresponding liability with realization of the asset.\nProvisions for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nWithin the Covestro Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and defined\nbenefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately\nadministered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual, or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been\npaid, the company has no further payment obligations. The regular contributions constitute expenses for the year\nin which they are due. As such, they are included in the functional cost items, and thus in EBIT. All other post-\nemployment benefit systems are defined benefit plans, which may be either unfunded, i.e., financed by provisions,\nor funded, i.e., financed through pension funds.\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligations and the resulting expense are calculated in accordance with\nIAS 19 (Employee Benefits) using the projected unit credit method. The future benefit obligations are valued by\nactuarial methods and spread over the entire employment period on the basis of specific assumptions regarding\nbeneficiary structure and the economic environment. These relate mainly to the discount rate, future salary and\npension increases, variations in health care costs, and mortality rates.\nThe discount rates used are calculated from the yields of high-quality corporate bond portfolios in specific\ncurrencies with cash flows approximately equivalent to the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The\nuniform discount rate derived from this interest rate structure is thus based on the yields, on the closing date, of a\nportfolio of corporate bonds with at least an AA or AAA rating whose weighted residual maturities approximately\ncorrespond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.\nThe fair value of plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation for pensions and\nother post-employment benefits to determine the net defined benefit liability. Plan assets in excess of the benefit\nobligation are reflected in other receivables, subject to the asset ceiling specified in IAS 19. Comprehensive\nactuarial valuations for all major plans are performed annually as of December 31.\nThe balance of all income and expenses relating to defined benefit plans, except the net interest on the net\nliability, is recognized in EBIT. The net interest is reflected in the financial result.\nThe effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in other comprehensive income.\nThey consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets, and changes in the effects of the asset\nceiling, less the respective amounts included in net interest for the last two components. Deferred taxes relating\nto the effects of remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.\n251 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Provisions\nOther provisions are measured in accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent\nAssets) or, where applicable, IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Where the cash outflow to settle an obligation is\nexpected to occur after one year, the provision is recognized at the present value of the expected cash outflow.\nClaims for reimbursements from third parties are separately recognized in other receivables if their realization is\nvirtually certain.\nIf the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the\ncorresponding amount and the resulting income generally recognized in the functional cost item(s) in which the\noriginal charge was recognized.\nTo enhance the information content of the estimates, certain provisions that could have a material effect on the\nnet assets, financial position, and results of operations are selected and tested for their sensitivity to changes in\nthe underlying parameters using sensitivity analysis. To reflect uncertainty about the likelihood of the assumed\nevents actually occurring, the impact of a five-percentage-point change in the probability of occurrence is\nexamined in each case.\nProvisions for environmental protection are recognized if future cash outflows are likely to be necessary to\nensure compliance with environmental regulations or to carry out remediation work based on an obligation, such\ncosts can be reliably estimated, and no future benefits are expected from such measures.\nEstimating the future costs of environmental protection and remediation involves many uncertainties, particularly\nwith regard to the status of laws, regulations, and the information available about conditions in the various\ncountries and at the individual sites. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in\nsimilar cases, the conclusions in expert opinions obtained for existing environmental programs, current costs,\nand new developments affecting these costs. Also taken into consideration are management\u2019s interpretation of\ncurrent environmental laws and regulations, the number and financial position of third parties that may become\nobligated to participate in any remediation costs on the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely\nto be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results.\nTaking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature,\nCovestro\u2019s management believes the existing provisions to be adequate based upon currently available\ninformation. Given the business environment in which the Covestro Group operates and the inherent difficulties in\naccurately estimating environmental liabilities, material additional costs beyond the amounts accrued may be\nincurred under certain circumstances. It may transpire during remediation work that additional expenditures are\nnecessary over an extended period and that these exceed existing provisions and cannot be reasonably\nestimated.\nProvisions for restructuring are based either on a legal or a constructive external obligation. They only cover\nexpenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are necessary for restructuring, and are not related to\nfuture business operations. Such expenses include severance payments to employees and compensation\npayments in respect of rented property that can no longer be used. Prior to recognition of this type of provision,\nthe associated assets are tested for impairment.\nRestructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of\nbusiness activities, leveraging of portfolio synergies, or fundamental reorganizations of business units. The\nrespective provisions are recognized when a detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up, resolved by the\nresponsible decision-making level of management, and communicated to the affected employees and/or their\nrepresentatives. Provisions for restructuring are generally recognized at the present value of future cash\noutflows.\nAs a company with international operations, the Covestro Group is exposed to numerous legal risks for which\nprovisions for litigation must be recognized under certain conditions \u2013 especially in the areas of product liability,\ncompetition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax law, environmental law, and compliance issues such as\ncorruption and export control.\n252 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nLitigation and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and\ncomplexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the jurisdiction in\nwhich each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. The outcomes of currently pending and future\nproceedings generally cannot be predicted. Judgment in court proceedings, regulatory decisions, or the\nconclusion of a settlement may result in the Covestro Group incurring charges for which no accounting\nmeasures have been taken for lack of reasonable estimate or which exceed established provisions and insurance\ncoverage.\nThe Covestro Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, and\nthe extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its Law, Intellectual Property &\nCompliance corporate function and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Covestro Group.\nWhere it is more likely than not that such litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably\nestimable, a provision for litigation is normally recognized in the amount of the present value of the expected\ncash outflows. Such provisions cover the estimated unavoidable payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural\ncosts, attorney costs, and the cost of potential settlements.\nIt is often impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the\nprobability that a potential outflow of resources will result from pending or future litigation. Due to the special\nnature of these litigation, provisions are generally not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of\npotential amounts or judgments have been issued, and not before at least a range of possible legal outcomes of\nsuch litigations can be determined. Provisions for legal defense costs are recognized if it is probable that material\ncosts will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the company\u2019s legal position and an outflow of\nresources can generally be expected.\nInternal and external legal counsels evaluate the current status of the material legal risks to the Covestro Group at\nthe end of each reporting period. The need to recognized or adjust a provision and the amount of the provision or\nadjustment are determined on this basis. Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nSee note 26 \u201cLegal Risks.\u201d\nPersonnel-related provisions are mainly those recorded for variable one-time payments, individual performance\nawards, long-service awards, severance payments in connection with early retirement arrangements, surpluses\non long-term accounts, and other personnel costs. Since January 1, 2022, calculation of the provision for short-\nterm variable compensation (\u201cCovestro Profit Sharing Plan\u201d, \u201cCovestro PSP\u201d) has been based not only on the\nachievement of financial performance indicators such as Earnings Before Interest , Taxes, Depreciation and\nAmortization (EBITDA), Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF), and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)\nabove Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), but also on a sustainability component measured on the basis\nof selected environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. In fiscal 2022, measurement was based on\nselected environmental criteria.\nObligations under share-based compensation programs that provide for awards payable in cash are also\nincluded in personnel-related provisions (\u201cPrisma\u201d). The compensation of the Board of Management of\nCovestro AG and of managerial employees includes cash compensation based on the share price that are\nearned with lock-up periods and are reflected in profit or loss as personnel expenses in line with the\nconsideration paid in the performance period. They are measured using a subscription price model at the time of\ngranting and at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment). In 2021, Prisma was\nexpanded to include a sustainability component that covers Covestro\u2019s target for reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions (CO equivalents, CO e).\n2 2\nMiscellaneous provisions include those for other liabilities, for product liability, for warranty, and insurance\npayments. Rebates to be granted to customers, on the other hand are reported under refund liabilities.\n253 Covestro Annual Report 2022\nCAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Receivables and Liabilities\nOther receivables are measured at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of\nthe asset.\nPending Transactions\nPending transactions relating to contributions in kind (\u201cexecutory contracts\u201d), i.e., agreements in relation to which\n(to a degree) neither the service nor the consideration has been rendered, are not recognized in the statement of\nfinancial position on the reporting date if there is no risk of a loss on the reporting date. If there is the risk of a loss,\nthis is generally anticipated in the form of provisions if all the other requirements are met. In contrast, gains\nanticipated from such agreements on the reporting date may not be recognized in the statement of financial\nposition. Examples of executory procurement contracts include contracts regarding the procurement of energy\nfor the operation of production facilities, which also includes what are known as power purchase agreements\n(PPA) for the procurement of power from renewable energy. In comparison, pending transactions in the area of\nthe application of the rules regarding financial instruments (financial derivatives) are to be recognized on the\nreporting date in the amount of the negative fair value if a loss is expected and in the amount of the positive fair\nvalue if a gain is expected.\n\n\nThe image is a diagram of a corporate risk management system, detailing the structure and flow of responsibilities within an organization. The system is layered to show different levels of oversight and operational functions related to risk management. Here is a breakdown of each level:\n\n1. **Supervisory Board / Audit Committee**:\n   - At the top, responsible for monitoring the risk management processes. This ensures oversight and accountability.\n\n2. **Board of Management**:\n   - Directly below the Supervisory Board/Audit Committee, this layer has overall responsibility for handling material risks and opportunities within the group. It also ensures the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system.\n\n3. **Corporate Risk Committee**:\n   - This committee ensures a holistic overview of the organization\u2019s risk landscape. It functions under the Board of Management to aggregate and assess risk information from various parts of the organization.\n\n4. **Corporate Risk Management**:\n   - Positioned below the Corporate Risk Committee, this level is responsible for the creation and implementation of risk management guidelines and software. It also handles communication and reporting, process-integrated monitoring, and provides guidance on risk management.\n\n5. **Sub-committees with Risk Owners**:\n   - At the operational level, these sub-committees are involved in the hands-on management of risks. They perform functions such as risk identification, evaluation, and handling, ensuring that risks are managed effectively on the ground level.\n\n6. **Corporate Audit**:\n   - Shown at the base of the diagram, operating independently from the risk management processes to ensure unbiased monitoring of the entire risk management system.\n\nThe diagram uses arrows to indicate the flow of information and responsibility, emphasizing a comprehensive and structured approach to risk management that integrates oversight, management, and execution across different levels of the organization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

The Board of Management meets on a regular basis as the Corpo-rate Sustainability Board ( \u201c CSB \u201d ) to discuss sustainability issues of importance to the company . Within the Board of Man-agement , Chairman Martin Daum is responsible for the topic of sustainability in accordance with the allocation plan . The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of Man-agement , in particular with regard to sustainability issues . At the same time , some members of the Audit Committee have expertise in the area of sustainability reporting and its auditing . The management and organizational structures established in the 2021 reporting year are intended to strategically support our sustainability goals . For this purpose , the Sustainability Steering Committee ( \u201c SSC \u201d ) was created across the board , as well as working groups for the focus topics E , S and G.Within the Legal and Compliance department , a team for sus-tainability management deals with the relevant management issues . In addition to sustainability reporting , it is also respon-sible for the further development of the sustainable business strategy , human rights compliance and stakeholder manage-ment . This function reports to the Chairman of the Board of Management via the Company \u2019 s Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer.Further relevant information can be found in the E Declaration on Corporate Governance.Principles and policies /uni2004GRI 2-23/uni2004We have anchored our values and principles in our Declaration of Principles on Social Responsibility and Human Rights , as well as in our overarching Daimler Truck Code of Conduct and in other topic-speci\ufb01c policies . By policies we mean the overarching in-house regulations of the Daimler Truck Group that provide the Group \u2019 s framework and which are directly binding for all employees and members of executive bodies de\ufb01ned in the scope of application . Speci\ufb01cations on responsibilities , process , quality , translation , approval , implementation and discontinuation , communication and documentation of policies are laid down in the Policy Management Manual . The House of Policies ( \u201c HoP \u201d ) is the o\ufb03cial platform for the entire Daimler Truck Group to create a transparent , e\ufb00ective and legally compliant policy landscape throughout the Group . All employees have access to the HoP and corresponding training courses are also o\ufb00ered . The central management and decision-making body for all sustainability topics ( Corporate Sustainability Board \u2013 \u201c CSB \u201d ) is part of the Board levels of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG . Under the leadership of the Chairman of the Board of Manage-ment , the Corporate Sustainability Board meets at least twice a year.The Sustainability Steering Committee ( \u201c SSC \u201d ) is composed of senior management level representa-tives of the segments and representatives of various functional units . The SSC , under the direction of the Chief Legal & Compliance Officer , advises \u2013 as required \u2013 on the course of action at least once a quarter and assesses the sustainability performance reported by the working groups . The processing of the focus topics from the sustain-able business strategy is organized and structured by the respective responsible departments in working groups . Progress made and any important decisions are reported to the SSC and the CSB or submitted to them for a decision./uni00A0Sustainability SteeringCommittee ( SSC ) Segments and cross functions ( Legal & Compliance , Research & Development , Production , Purchasing , Group Strategy , Human Resources , Finance & Accounting , Sales , Investor Relations as well as External Affairs and Corporate Communications ) Board of Management ( BoM ) CorporateSustainability Board ( CSB ) =B.25Governance StructureAnnual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 66B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Compliance/uni2004GRI 2-27 , 3-3 , 205-1/-2/-3 , 206-1 , 207/uni2004/uni2003/uni2003/uni2004SDG 16/uni2004We are convinced : Only those who act ethically and legally responsible will remain successful in the long term . Compli-ance with rules and a corresponding compliance culture therefore assume a high priority at Daimler Truck . Compliance and responsible corporate governance are in line with our understanding of sustainable business . Daimler Truck has therefore implemented an established Compliance Man-agement System ( \u201c CMS \u201d ) , which comprises programs and pro-cesses to comply with legal requirements and to prevent mis-conduct . Daimler Truck informs and raises the awareness of its employees on compliance issues through numerous training measures and communication campaigns.Compliance management focus areasValue-based compliance is an indispensable part of our daily business activities and means that we aim to comply with laws and internal regulations . Our intention is to encourage compli-ant conduct throughout the entire company around the world by taking speci\ufb01c measures . In the following , we explain how we are pursuing our main objectives , what are the regulations and policies providing us with orientation in this regard , and which speci\ufb01c measures we are implementing . The main objectives of our Group-wide compliance activities are : \u2013 Combating corruption\u2013 Preserving maintaining and promoting fair competition\u2013 Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory requirements\u2013 Respecting and supporting human rights\u2013 Adherence to data protection laws\u2013 Preventing money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing\u2013 Complying with sanctions and export regulationsCombating corruptionThe objective of our compliance measures is to minimize cor-ruption in all business activities . We therefore critically examine our business partners and transactions and deal with authori-ties and public o\ufb03cials in a particularly sensitive manner . An important component of our anti-corruption compliance management system is Transparency International \u2019 s Corrup-tion Perception Index . We see increased corruption risks in the area of sales activities in high-risk countries as well as in our business relations with authorized dealers and general distrib-utors worldwide.Maintaining and promoting fair competitionOur Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Program is oriented to national and international standards to ensure fair competition . It comprises a binding , globally valid Daimler Truck Group stan-dard that de\ufb01nes how matters of antitrust law are to be assessed and how the work with industry associations has to be carried out . It is based on the standards of the underlying European regulations and takes into account established legal practice at European antitrust authorities , as well as the rulings of European courts . Additional guidelines and practical toolkits are also intended to support our employees worldwide in recognizing situations that are critical under antitrust law and acting in accordance with the regulations . This is particularly important when employees deal with competitors , cooperate with dealers and general distributors , and participate in trade association work.Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory requirementsProduct compliance for Daimler Truck means compliance with technical and regulatory requirements , standards and laws that are relevant to business activities around the world.Our objective is to identify risks within the product creation process - i.e. , in product development and certi\ufb01cation \u2013 as well as in product reliability process at an early stage , includ-ing the implementation of preventative measures . In doing so , we take into account the fundamental spirit of laws and regula-tions as well as internal speci\ufb01cations and processes in devel-opment and production as well as a/fter the vehicles have been placed on the market.The Product Compliance Management System ( \u201c PCMS \u201d ) de\ufb01nes principles , structures and processes in order to pro-vide our employees with certainty and guidance , especially in terms of challenging questions on how to interpret technical regulations . Furthermore , the PCMS also includes minimum standards for handling our products in the \ufb01eld regarding safety , regulatory conformity and emissions issues.Respecting and supporting human rightsWe are strongly committed to respect and support human rights and we also expect this from our business partners throughout the value chain . With our Human Rights Compli-ance Management System ( \u201c Human Rights CMS \u201d ) , we pursue a systematic approach to ful\ufb01lling our human rights due dili-gence obligations . The Human Rights CMS is based on interna-tionally recognized standards , such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ( \u201c UNGPs \u201d ) , which are the basis for regulatory and legislative business and human rights e\ufb00orts worldwide.As part of the CMS , we systematically review on a risk basis whether human rights are respected in our controlled Group companies and in our supply chain , and have de\ufb01ned various measures , both to prevent and minimize potential adverse impacts on human rights through our companies and our busi-ness activities , and to remedy them . Further information can be found in the chapter E/uni00A0Human rights . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 67B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Adhering to data protection lawsAt Daimler Truck , data and the systematic evaluation of data are the basis for new business models , innovative technologies and e\ufb03cient processes . However , data not only opens up busi-ness opportunities , but its handling requires special care as comprehensive data protection requirements apply both in Europe and globally.In the year under review , we at Daimler Truck adopted a com-mitment to data responsibility which de\ufb01nes a clear framework on how we handle data based on the three guiding principles of \u201c added value for the customer \u201d , \u201c business potential \u201d and \u201c responsible use of data \u201d .The Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer performs the tasks de\ufb01ned by law to comply with data protection regulations.Daimler Truck \u2019 s \u201c Global Data and Information Policy \u201d lays the foundation for responsible and legally compliant handling of information and data worldwide . It de\ufb01nes a binding minimum standard for all Group units . Besides that , the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the applicable local data protection laws are to be considered.At the same time , our Data Compliance Management System supports the Group in systematically planning , implementing , and continuously monitoring measures to ensure compliance with the data protection requirements.Daimler Truck has established a central reporting procedure for all information security incidents : The Information Security Incident Management Process . Employees and contractors are instructed to report all potential personal data breaches and information security violations via this process . During the year under review , a small number of cases were reported to the responsible data protection authorities . This did not result in any o\ufb03cial measures against the company.The contact details of the Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer are pub-licly available . Customers with data protection concerns can always contact the Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer . In the year under review , Daimler Truck did not have any cases in which data protection supervisory authorities took action following a cus-tomer complaint.Preventing money laundering and financing of terrorismThe purpose of compliance in the prevention of money launder-ing and terrorist \ufb01nancing is both to prevent the placement of funds from criminal transactions into the legal economic cycle and the \ufb01nancing of terrorist associations via transactions with Daimler Truck . Therefore , we have implemented global mini-mum standards , processes and safeguards throughout the Group to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws . Daimler Truck has appointed a Group Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cer . He ensures compliance across divisions at Daimler Truck Holding AG and all of its Group companies and is respon-sible for Group-wide standards and processes pursuant to the German Anti-Money Laundering Act.The Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cer is assisted by two deputy Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cers . One deputy is responsible for ensuring compliance measures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing for the Industrial Business , while the other deputy is responsible for the segment Financial Services.Complying with sanctions and export regulationsA central Group unit for export control , sanctions , anti-money- laundering and dangerous goods pursues a combined compli-ance approach with the aim to ensure all applicable personal sanctions ( sanctions compliance ) and goods-related sanctions ( export control compliance ) in the best way possible through-out the Group . As a minimum standard of Daimler Truck , regardless of its applicability , the sanctions lists of the EU , the United Kingdom and the US ( including the US O\ufb03ce of Foreign Assets Control ( \u201c OFAC \u201d ) ; US Bureau of Industry and Security ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) ) are checked through an IT-system in every business transaction . Group-wide export control ensures , both through its worldwide internal policy and through its IT-supported export control management system , that applicable national and suprana-tional export control prohibitions and licensing requirements are observed for all exports or shipments of export control- relevant goods initiated by Daimler Truck or controlled majority companies.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 68B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Compliance Management SystemThrough our Compliance Management System ( \u201c CMS \u201d ) , we at Daimler Truck aim to promote compliance with regulations and policies at our company and to prevent misconduct . The mea-sures needed for this are de\ufb01ned by our compliance and legal organizations in a process that also takes the Company \u2019 s busi-ness requirements into account in an appropriate manner . The CMS consists of basic principles and measures that ensure compliant behavior throughout the Company . It is based on national and international standards and is applied on a global scale at Daimler Truck . The CMS consists of seven elements that build on one another.B.26The Daimler Truck Compliance Management System 4 . Risks5 . Program1 . Values7 . Monitoring & Improvement6 . Communication & Training2 . Objectives3 . Organization Corporate culture and compliance valuesWe aim to ensure that all employees are aware of and comply with the applicable Code of Conduct and act responsibly , with integrity and in compliance with the rules . Our Group-wide Code of Conduct serves as a general benchmark for us : It sets out the guidelines for our actions and helps us to make the right decisions . The policy is binding for all employees of the controlled Group companies of Daimler Truck Holding AG , is available in ten languages and centrally . In 2022 , the Code of Conduct was revised with the help of employees and aligned with the \u201c Purpose Principles \u201d of Daimler Truck . It was pub-lished at the beginning of February 2023.Compliance objectives The objectives of the compliance program are de\ufb01ned and under the responsibility of the Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer and the Compliance Board on the basis of the compli-ance strategy . The compliance strategy is derived from the corporate objectives as well as from the applicable laws , regu-lations , voluntary commitments and the \u201c Purpose Principles \u201d of Daimler Truck . For the individual compliance areas , this means minimizing corruption risks , antitrust risks , export control risks , risks from money laundering and violations of sanctions and terror lists , data protection , product conformity and human rights as well as speci\ufb01c environmental risks.Compliance organizationThe compliance organization of the Daimler Truck Group is organized regionally and along the functions . In this way , it can provide e\ufb00ective support \u2013 for example , through guidelines and recommendations . Functional or regional contacts are available for this purpose . Therefore , a global network of local contacts ensures that our compliance standards are upheld . The network supports the management of the Group compa-nies in implementing our compliance program locally . In addi-tion , the Compliance Board manages overarching issues and monitors whether our measures are e\ufb00ective . The Board has the task of responding at an early stage to changes in business models and in the business environment , picking-up on regula-tory developments and continuously developing the CMS . The Compliance Board is composed of representatives of the Com-pliance and Legal departments , meets regularly and is chaired by the Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer . He reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG and reports regularly to the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG , to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and to the Group Risk Management Committee . From the Company \u2019 s perspec-tive , the compliance network \u2019 s independence from the seg-ments is assured by the direct reporting line to Legal and Com-pliance department and to the Chairman of the Board of Management . Compliance risksDaimler Truck systematically reviews and evaluates all con-trolled Group companies and majority shareholdings globally and its own central units on a regular basis in order to mini-mize compliance risks . In doing so , centrally available data is accessed and , if necessary , local information . The results of the regular compliance risk evaluation form the basis of our risk controlling . We use these to implement targeted risk-mini-mizing measures worldwide . This risk management approach serves as a framework for all compliance \ufb01elds . The risk analy-sis for Daimler Truck , which is valid for \ufb01nancial year 2022 , was carried out before the spin-o\ufb00 from the former Daimler AG at the end of 2021 and forms the basis of our compliance risk management . The compliance risk management processes were adopted by Daimler Truck a/fter the spin-o\ufb00 and adapted to its requirements in the reporting year . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 69B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck BPO Compliance programDaimler Truck \u2019 s compliance program comprises elements such as the Business Practices O\ufb03ce , business partner due diligence processes , compliance contractual clauses and other measures tailored to the respective compliance \ufb01eld in order to minimize risks and counteract violations of laws and rules . The individual measures are derived from the \ufb01ndings of our systematic compliance risk analysis . In this respect , we focus on , among other things : Continuous enhancement of aware-ness of compliance and adherence to relevant processes , con-sistent follow-up of reports of misconduct , and the formulation of clear requirements for the conduct of our business partners.Reporting of rule violations via the BPO whistleblower system/uni2004GRI 2-27/uni2004The whistleblower system Business Practices O\ufb03ce ( \u201c BPO \u201d ) enables employees of Daimler Truck as well as business part-ners and third parties around the world to report violations of regulations . Information can be submitted by email , post or by using a reporting form . In addition , external toll-free hotlines are available in Brazil , Japan , South Africa and the US . Reports can also be submitted anonymously if local laws permit this . In Germany , a neutral external intermediary is available for whis-tleblowers as an additional contact point . Reports to the BPO whistleblower system alert us to potential risks for the Group and its employees . This can prevent damage.A globally valid corporate policy de\ufb01nes BPO procedures and the corresponding responsibilities . Its aim is to ensure a fair and transparent procedure that takes both the principle of pro-portionality for the person concerned and the protection of the whistleblower into account . The policy also serves as the standard by which we at Daimler Truck judge breaches of regulations and decide on consequences . If , a/fter an initial risk-based assessment , a noti\ufb01cation is classi\ufb01ed as a violation of the rules with a low risk for the Company , the BPO transfers the case to the responsible department , for example Human Resources , Corporate Secu-rity , or Corporate Data Protection . The relevant department follows up on the noti\ufb01cation and clari\ufb01es the case under its own responsibility . Rule violations with a low risk for the Com-pany include , for example , the/ft , embezzlement or personal enrichment with a value of less than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 provided that they do not fall into the category of corruption.If the BPO classi\ufb01es a noti\ufb01cation as a high-risk breach of reg-ulations , a/fter a risk-based initial assessment , it then refers the case to an investigative unit . The BPO provides support for the subsequent investigation until the case is closed . Examples of high-risk rule violations include o\ufb00enses related to corrup-tion , breaches of antitrust law , and violations of anti-money laundering regulations , as well as violations of binding techni-cal provisions or violations in connection with environmental regulations . Cases of sexual harassment , human rights viola-tions , discrimination and racism are also among the high-risk rule violations . In order to constantly increase trust in our BPO whistleblower system and make it even better known to our employees , we are reporting and raising awareness about the BPO through a variety of communication measures .

Among the newly opened cases , two fell into the category of \u201c corruption ( pas-sive ) \u201d , two in the category of \u201c severe cases of sexual harass-ment \u201d and two in the category of \u201c severe injuries to physical and psychological integrity \u201d . A further eight cases fell in the category of \u201c the/ft ( over \u20ac100,000 ) \u201d , four in the category of \u201c damage to reputation \u201d and one in the category of \u201c other high risks \u201d .In the 2022 reporting year , a total of 15 cases classi\ufb01ed as \u201c applicable/closed ( partially ) with merit \u201d were closed . In these 15 cases , a speci\ufb01c initial suspicion had been con\ufb01rmed . Three of these cases were in the category of \u201c the/ft ( over \u20ac100,000 ) , \u201d nine in the category of \u201c damages ( over \u20ac100,000 ) , \u201d and three in the category of \u201c severe cases of sexual harassment. \u201d The company decides here on appropriate measures in terms of proportionality and fairness . In the year under review , person-nel measures included summary dismissals , disciplinary warn-ings and warnings with a reduction in variable remuneration , suspensions and voluntary termination.Further information and contact details can be found on our w/uni00A0Website.Sales partners and suppliers acting with integrityIn this regard , beyond the Group companies , we also formulate clear requirements for our business partners , because conduct with integrity and in compliance with rules is a prerequisite for trusting cooperation . When selecting our direct business part-ners , we therefore pay close attention to ensure that they com-ply with the law and that they pay the same attention in the supply chain . Our expectations of them have been set out in detail in the Business Partner Standards , which were revised during the reporting year and which we hand out to our busi-ness partners . In the Business Partner Standards , we also summarize all the requirements we place on our suppliers for sustainable action and formulate our expectations with regard to working conditions , respect and support human rights , the environment and safety , and compliance . Further require-ments can be found in our \u201c Daimler Truck Special Terms \u201d ( order conditions ) and the compliance contractual clauses . We also provide our business partners with a speci\ufb01cally devel-oped Compliance Awareness Module . The module raises awareness of current requirements and o\ufb00ers our suppliers and sales partners assistance in dealing with potential compli-ance risks . In accordance with the United Nations Guiding Prin-ciples on Business and Human Rights , we are working to ensure that business partners , especially direct suppliers , also respect human rights . Besides this , we are committed to ensuring that this is also the case with indirect suppliers and are taking appropriate measures . We review direct business partners as part of risk-based due diligence processes . In the year under review , we audited all new sales partners . In addition , we use a permanent monitor-ing process to review all current sales partners with the aim of identifying possible conduct violations by sales partners . In the year under review , we also further developed our globally standardized and risk-based procedures for selecting and cooperating with suppliers , particularly in light of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . Further information can be found on the w/uni00A0Website for our suppliers and in the chapters E/uni00A0Green supply chain and E/uni00A0Human rights.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 71B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Internal information , communication and training measuresDaimler Truck o\ufb00ers a comprehensive range of training courses on compliance topics . Training needs are determined on a regular basis and adjustments as well as enhancements were carried out . The contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respec-tive target group . A web-based and target group-oriented training program is available for employees in administrative areas , consisting of a range of mandatory modules . Employees from production and production-related areas can voluntarily take part in the training program . The training modules are assigned when an employee is hired , promoted or transferred to a function that involves an increased risk . The web-based training measures are available worldwide via a Learning Management System ( \u201c LMS \u201d ) . We are supplementing our web-based training program with face-to-face training , some of which we conducted in digital form in 2022 . We also o\ufb00er information and quali\ufb01cation measures for supervisory and management functions . As part of an executive onboarding program , we are providing information on legal and compli-ance topics in order to assist newly appointed Supervisory Board members and members of the executive management of the Group companies in their new role .

Centrally available data and , if necessary , local information is accessed . References to non-e\ufb00ective implementation of measures are recorded as part of monitoring and measures are de\ufb01ned for this purpose . If required by changing risks or new legal require-ments , we adapt our processes and measures in the CMS.The monitoring results and other possible measures are evalu-ated and approved by the Compliance Board . The compliance risk and monitoring process is carried out at Daimler Truck for all speci\ufb01ed compliance \ufb01elds . Compliance \ufb01elds that are in the process of being set up are subject to an adequacy check . Moreover , compliance programs and processes along estab-lished areas are examined in regard to their e\ufb00ectiveness . /uni25B4In the reporting year , the described monitoring process and the annual adequacy and e\ufb00ectiveness review did not reveal any indications that the compliance program , processes or measures decided upon would not be appropriate or e\ufb00ective in the context of the company \u2019 s risk situation./uni25BE Furthermore , KPMG AG Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft , Berlin , audited the CMS of the former Daimler AG for anti-cor-ruption , antitrust and technical compliance ( \u201c tCMS \u201d ) in accor-dance with Auditing Standard 980 of the German Institute of Public Auditors . The audits were geared to appropriateness , implementation and e\ufb00ectiveness , and were successfully com-pleted for the former Daimler AG , for CMS anti-corruption in 2019 , for tCMS with a focus on emissions relevance in 2020 , and for CMS antitrust in 2021 as a re-audit a/fter the initial audit in 2016 . In 2019 , the design of the Data CMS was also audited . Selected units of Daimler Truck AG also participated in the decentralized e\ufb00ectiveness audit.Risk and opportunity management /uni2004GRI 2-25/uni2004Risk and opportunity management is an integral part of the Group-wide planning , management and reporting process . It is intended to support the achievement of the Company \u2019 s goals in a sustainable manner and to raise awareness of risks in the Company . The ESG-related risks and opportunities that are linked to our own business activities , products , and services of Daimler Truck and that could very probably have serious nega-tive impact on the non-\ufb01nancial aspects with regard to the CSR Directive Implementation Act ( \u201c CSR-RUG \u201d ) can be found in the overall assessment of the risk and opportunity situation in the risk and opportunity report of the combined manage-ment report . There was no occurrence of serious non-\ufb01nancial risks in the year under review . Detailed information can be found in the E Risk and Opportunity Report . /uni25B4Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 73B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Tax obligations /uni2004GRI 207/uni2004Daimler Truck sees itself as a responsible company that strives to comply with its worldwide tax obligations . In this context , we want to live up to our corporate values and to our social and ethical responsibility . As part of the tax strategy of the Group , we pursue the follow-ing principles in particular , taking into account the economic and social impacts and in accordance with the corporate and business strategy : \u2013 Through our actions , we want to ensure that the tax obliga-tions of Group \u2019 s companies are met and integrity standards are maintained through measures such as e\ufb03cient , high-quality and reliable expertise , processes , systems , methods and controls.\u2013 We live an active risk management for the Group and its operational employees through an appropriate Tax Compli-ance Management System ( \u201c Tax CMS \u201c ) . \u2013 We pursue legal , active and non-aggressive tax planning based on economic grounds ( \u201c tax follows business \u201d ) . This means that we , as a company , comply with our responsibility as a taxpayer . We also strive to work cooperatively , transpar-ently , and constructively with the tax authorities . In the pro-cess , we maintain our legal standpoints and defend our interests wherever we believe such actions are appropriate and legitimate . The Group \u2019 s tax strategy de\ufb01nes the limits of our actions , and this strategy is further speci\ufb01ed and imple-mented by means of organizational and content-related policies , provisions , and instructions.The worldwide responsibility for tax is allocated to the Head of Tax of Daimler Truck . Signi\ufb01cant tax-relevant decisions are made in the Tax Compliance and Tax Risk Committee ( \u201c TCRC \u201d ) , which the Chief Financial O\ufb03cer is a member of . The TCRC is also kept informed on an ongoing basis about material tax issues . The tax policies regulate the responsibilities , tasks and duties of the persons entrusted with tax matters at Daimler Truck . In addition , they provide concrete implementation guidelines for meeting relevant legal obligations and enhance our employees \u2019 awareness of tax-related issues . In accordance with the Group \u2019 s Code of Conduct , intentional violations of external and/or internal tax requirements must be reported and fol-lowed up . The same applies to failure to correct incorrectly processed transactions.The Group-wide Tax CMS is a de\ufb01ned sub-area of our general CMS and is the responsibility of the Tax department . Tax risk management is also part of the Tax CMS . Its function is to monitor and check whether tax obligations are met . This risk management system , which is consistent across the Group , serves to identify and reduce tax risks within Daimler Truck and associated personal risks of the employees acting on behalf of the Group . It comprises numerous measures , such as ongoing monitoring or integration of tax risks in the internal control system and in the Group-wide risk management pro-cess in accordance with the risk management policy . In the year under review , we were not aware of any signi\ufb01cant viola-tions of tax laws that would have resulted in criminal proceed-ings.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 74B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 101B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler TruckEnvironmental objective 4 - \u201c Transition to a circular economy \u201d \u2013 Activity 3.3 : The possibility of using secondary raw materials and the possibility of a design for easy disassembly and durability must be taken into account for the relevant vehi-cles . In addition , hazardous substances must be traceable and a waste management established at the sites . In this context , various Group-internal guidelines and standards apply as well as , in individual cases , further suitable evi-dence . The issue of durability is anchored , for example , in the product development process . The \u201c Group Standard for Waste Management \u201d de\ufb01nes waste management across the Group . \u2013 Activities 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.6 : The criterion requires the exis-tence of waste management measures , in particular at the end of a vehicle \u2019 s life cycle.\u2013 Activities 6.5 and 6.6 : De\ufb01ned quotas of recyclable or reus-able materials in the products must be complied with . If the quotas determined in accordance with the speci\ufb01cations reach the required threshold values , the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful\ufb01lled . Environmental objective 5 - \u201c Pollution prevention and control \u201d - Activity 3.3 : The criterion is based on Appendix C of the Del-egated Regulation ( EU ) 2021/2139 . Appendix C refers to var-ious European regulations out of the chemicals legislation . The de\ufb01ned substances are subject to restrictions on manu-facture , placing on the market and use , both in terms of use at the sites and in the products . There are di\ufb03culties in interpreting the vague legal term \u201c essential for society \u201d . \u2013 Activities 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.6 : Compliance with certain tire cate-gories in terms of rolling resistance and rolling noise shall be demonstrated . In the reporting year , appropriate analyses were performed for the relevant vehicles to provide the required evidence . If information on the tires is available and the corresponding classes are adhered to , the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful\ufb01lled . Environmental objective 6 - \u201c Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems \u201d - Activity 3.3 : The criterion refers to Appendix D of Delegated Regulation ( EU ) 2021/2139 , which de\ufb01nes requirements for the protection of biodiversity and biodiversity-sensitive areas in the vicinity of the sites . As part of the environmen-tal due diligence audits , compliance with environmental per-mits is veri\ufb01ed , among other aspects . The impact on nearby , sensitive areas is also examined . If required , measures are derived ( for details , see chapter E Preventing pollution ) .During the assessment , the relevant technical screening crite-ria were analyzed , interpreted , the results documented and substantiated by corresponding evidence documents and cal-culations.Minimum safeguards As part of the audit of compliance with the minimum safe-guards , the following topics were analyzed centrally : - Human rights , including labor rights ; - Corruption and bribery ; - Taxation ; \u2013 Fair competition.No increased risk was identi\ufb01ed and assessed in this regard for the 2022 reporting year . For each potential risk area , pre-ventive and , if necessary , remedial measures are already in place . As part of the due diligence processes , it was possible to demonstrate that there are no convictions in any of the four subject areas ( for details , see chapter E Social ) Reporting on the three performance indicatorsReporting on the KPIs required under the Taxonomy Regulation for turnover , CapEx and OpEx is shown in tables \uf0e4/uni00A0B.52 , \uf0e4/uni00A0B.53 and \uf0e4/uni00A0B.54 . All activities are fully assigned to the envi-ronmental objective of \u201c climate change mitigation \u201d . Further-more , all activities can be clearly assigned to the respective economic activity according to the Taxonomy Regulation . This avoids double counting in the calculation of the overall perfor-mance indicators .

The reporting date for the collection of quantitative data was December 31 , 2022 . Isolated deviations are marked in each case.During the reporting period , further organizational changes occurred due to the spin-o\ufb00 of Daimler Truck AG in Decem-ber 2021 from the former Daimler AG compared to the 2021 Report , so that comparability of the data with the previous Sustainability Report is only partially possible.We see more integrated reporting as another important mech-anism for further developing our sustainable business strategy . For this reason , we have decided to integrate aspects of sus-tainability into the Annual Report for the reporting year and have refrained from a separate sustainability report./uni25BE EU taxonomy Companies are obliged to apply the Taxonomy Regulation if they are required to prepare a non-\ufb01nancial statement in accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the EU Accounting Directive , implemented by Section 289b Subsection 1 and Sec-tion 315b Subsection 1 of the HGB . According to this , Daimler Truck has been obliged to apply the Taxonomy Regulation since the 2021 reporting year . Daimler Truck applied the reporting requirements in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation for the 2021 reporting year and exercised the relief provisions for the year of initial application , according to which only the tax-onomy eligibility had to be reported . For the 2022 reporting year , Daimler Truck is publishing the full disclosures in accor-dance with the Taxonomy Regulation for the \ufb01rst time . Thus , in addition to the proportions of taxonomy-eligible and non-eligi-ble economic activities , the proportions of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in turnover , investments ( \u201c CapEx \u201d ) and operating expenditure ( \u201c OpEx \u201d ) must also be disclosed . Production-related energy and environmental data/uni2004GRI 305-1/-2/-4/uni2004The data in the Environment section is based on the Group structure as of the reporting date of December 31 , 2022 . This includes all production sites and selected test tracks and R & D sites of the Group companies controlled by Daimler Truck as well as selected joint ventures with 50 % participation . Production sites include all \u201c Completely Built Up \u201d ( \u201c CBU \u201d ) , \u201c Completely Knocked Down \u201d ( \u201c CKD \u201d ) and Remanufacturing ( \u201c Reman \u201d ) sites . There has been no retroactive adjustment of the \ufb01gures for 2020 and 2021.The environmental data is collected from the sites in our envi-ronmental data system . If in individual cases no actual values are available in February , estimates are made on the basis of the previous year \u2019 s values and the change in production . Air emissions are measured regularly and extrapolated to the year , and VOC emissions are also calculated on the basis of various input or output parameters.Daimler Truck calculates and documents its CO2 emissions according to the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Stan-dard 2004 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative , in accor-dance with the categories Scope 1 and Scope 2 . Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are reported in accordance with the Con-trol approach of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.Documented are all direct CO2 emissions from our Company \u2019 s own sources ( Scope 1 ) , indirect emissions resulting from the generation of the purchased electricity and district heat ( Scope 2 ) .Scope 1 : We calculate our direct emissions from the combus- tion of fuels , heating oil , natural gas , lique\ufb01ed petroleum gas , and coal with \ufb01xed CO2 emission factors as speci\ufb01ed by the Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 127B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 143B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportWarranty and goodwill cases could arise in the Daimler Truck Group if the quality of products does not meet the require-ments , regulations are not fully complied with , or support in the event of problems and product care can not be provided in the required form . Such warranty and goodwill cases as well as quality problems both with components in vehicles and in con-nection with technical innovations on vehicles that require adjustments can lead to \ufb01nancial burdens . Possible claims in connection with such risks are examined and , if necessary , appropriate measures are initiated for the a\ufb00ected products.Information technology risks and opportunitiesThe systematically pursued digitalization strategy opens up new opportunities for Daimler Truck and allows it to enhance customer bene\ufb01ts and the value of the Company . Neverthe-less , the high penetration level of information technology ( \u201c IT \u201d ) in all business areas also harbors risks for business and pro-duction processes as well as for their services and products.The ever-growing threat posed by cybercrime and the spread of aggressive malicious code give rise to risks that can a\ufb00ect the availability , integrity and con\ufb01dentiality of information and IT-supported operating resources . Despite extensive precau-tions , in the worst-case scenario , this can lead to a temporary interruption of IT-supported business processes with severe negative e\ufb00ects on the Group \u2019 s earnings . In addition , the loss or misuse of sensitive data may under certain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation . In particular , applicable regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Directive ( \u201c EU-GDPR \u201d ) may , among other things , give rise to claims by third parties and result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties with an impact on earnings.For the globally active Daimler Truck Group and its comprehen-sive business and production processes , it is of vital impor-tance that information is available , up-to-date , complete and correct and that it can be exchanged as needed . The Group \u2019 s internal IT security framework is based on international stan-dards and uses industrial standards and good practice as part of its protective measures . New regulatory requirements for cyber security and cyber security management systems are taken into account in the further development of our processes and policies.Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable IT infrastructure must be used to protect information . Cyber threats must be identi\ufb01ed over the entire lifecycle of applications and IT sys-tems , and dealt with in line with their criticality . Particular attention is paid to risks that could , at worst , result in an inter-ruption of business processes due to IT system failures and/or the loss and corruption of data . The advancing digitalization and connectivity of production equipment is supplemented by coordinated technical and organizational security measures.Due to growing demands concerning the con\ufb01dentiality , integ-rity and availability of data , Daimler Truck has implemented a wide range of preventive and corrective measures in order to minimize the associated risks and limit possible damage . For example , the Group reduces potential interruptions of operat-ing processes in data centers by means of mirrored data sets , decentralized data storage , outsourced data backups and IT systems designed for high availability . Emergency plans are developed and employees are trained and regularly sensitized in order to maintain operating capability . Speci\ufb01c threats are analyzed , and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active Cyber Security & Response Center . The protection of products and services against the danger of falling prey to hacker attacks and cybercrime is under constant development.Personnel risks and opportunitiesThe Daimler Truck Group is dependent on good relationships with its employees , their trade unions as well as employee representative bodies and stakeholders and is party to a number of collective agreements , some of which impose obli-gations and restrictions on the Daimler Truck Group in connec-tion with reorganizations , restructurings or similar corporate actions and which it may not be able to extend , renew or replace in a favorable or timely manner or at all . Any deteriora-tion of the relationships with trade unions , works councils and other employee representative bodies could adversely impact the Daimler Truck Group \u2019 s business operations . The Group could face strikes or other types of con\ufb02icts with trade unions , works councils or its employees in the future . Any such strikes , con\ufb02icts , work stoppages or other industrial actions may dis-rupt the Group \u2019 s production and sales activities , damage its reputation and adversely a\ufb00ect its customer relations . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 144B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportCompetition for highly quali\ufb01ed employees and managers con-tinues to be very \ufb01erce in the industry and the regions in which Daimler Truck operates . The future success of the Daimler Truck Group also depends on the extent to which it succeeds in recruiting , integrating and retaining specialist sta\ufb00 . The established human resources instruments take such personnel risks into consideration . A particular focus of human resources management is the targeted personnel development and fur-ther training of the Company \u2019 s workforce . In order to remain successful as a company , we continuously develop the way we work together and optimize our management culture.Demographic developments are forcing the Group to deal with changes caused by an aging workforce and to secure a skilled new generation of specialists and future executives . Generation management addresses this by implementing mea-sures that do justice to the scope of the issue . We counter eco-nomic , market and competitive \ufb02uctuations with the estab-lished time and \ufb02exibility instruments , enabling reactions that are suitable for the respective situation . Efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial for the Group to maintain its competitiveness and improve its prof-itability . The Group is in the midst of implementing a number of operational performance and cost-saving initiatives to address \ufb01xed and variable costs a\ufb00ecting pro\ufb01tability . These opera-tional performance and cost-saving measures , or components thereof , may not deliver the intended bene\ufb01ts within the time the Group targets . This may result in implementation costs in excess of those originally budgeted by the Group and the actual results of the initiatives may di\ufb00er from the targets . If the targeted operational performance and cost-saving mea-sures are not fully realized or achieved within the intended time , this could have an adverse e\ufb00ect on the Group \u2019 s pro\ufb01t margins.Risks and opportunities related to associated companies and joint venturesCooperation with partners in associated companies and joint ventures is of vital importance for Daimler Truck , in the trans-formation towards both zero-emission mobility and compre-hensive digitalization . Particularly in the case of new technolo-gies , associated companies can help boost synergy e\ufb00ects and improve cost structures in order to successfully face the com-petition in the commercial vehicle industry.The Daimler Truck Group generally participates in the risks and opportunities of associated companies and joint ventures in line with its equity interest . It is also subject to share-price risks and opportunities if those companies are listed on the stock exchange.The remeasurement of an interest in an associated company can result in risks and opportunities related to the invest-ment \u2019 s carrying amount for the segment to which the associ-ated company belongs . Risks can also arise from ongoing busi-ness activities , especially through the integration of employees , technologies and products . The Group \u2019 s business and legal interests may not always be aligned with those of its associated companies and joint ventures and any of the Group \u2019 s current or future associated companies or joint ven-tures may fail to be successful , achieve their planned objec-tives and meet their targeted timelines . In addition , further \ufb01nancial obligations or additional \ufb01nancing requirements could arise . Associated companies are subject to a monitoring pro-cess so that , if necessary , decisions can be promptly made on whether or not measures should be taken to support or secure pro\ufb01tability . The recoverable amounts of investments in asso-ciated companies are also regularly monitored . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 148B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportViolations of regulations on anti-corruption , antitrust law , sanc-tions , export control , anti-money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing , product requirements , data protection and the han-dling of hazardous goods are sanctioned , e.g . with regulatory \ufb01nes or criminal consequences . In addition , any violation can lead to negative media coverage and a\ufb00ect the Group \u2019 s reputa-tion . Risks from legal proceedingsThe subsidiaries of Daimler Truck Holding AG ( especially Daimler Truck AG ) are confronted with various legal proceed-ings , claims as well as governmental investigations and orders ( legal proceedings ) on a large number of topics . These include , for example , vehicle conformity and vehicle safety , dealer , sup-plier and other contractual relationships , \ufb01nancial services , industrial property rights ( in particular patent infringement suits ) , warranty claims , and antitrust proceedings ( including claims for damages ) . If the outcome of such legal proceedings is negative for the Daimler Truck Group or such proceedings are settled , the Group may be required to pay substantial com-pensatory and punitive damages or to undertake service actions , recall campaigns , monetary penalties or other costly actions . Legal proceedings and related settlements may have an impact on the Group \u2019 s reputation.Antitrust law proceedings ( including actions for damages ) Mercedes-Benz Group AG , under the former name Daimler AG the former parent entity of Daimler Truck AG , was subject to an antitrust proceeding initiated by the European Commission . In July 2016 , the European Commission issued a settlement decision against the former Daimler AG and four other Euro-pean truck manufacturers for their participation in anti-com-petitive behavior in violation of European antitrust rules with regard to pricing and passing on the costs of compliance with strict emission rules for trucks . The European Commission found that Daimler AG participated in the relevant arrange-ments from January 17 , 1997 to January 18 , 2011 . The individual \ufb01ne imposed on Daimler AG by the European Commission \u2019 s settlement decision amounted to \u20ac1.09 billion and was fully paid in 2016.Following the settlement decision by the European Commis-sion , legal actions , class actions and other forms of legal redress for damages by direct and indirect truck customers have been \ufb01led or initiated in several jurisdictions . Damage claims could result in substantial liabilities for the Daimler Truck Group as well as signi\ufb01cant costs expended for defense measures , which may have a material adverse e\ufb00ect on the Daimler Truck Group \u2019 s operations and its liquidity and capital resources.In relation to the cartel infringement described above , most substantial claims ( including certain types of class actions or aggregator claims ) are pending or have been initiated in Ger-many , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and Spain . Claims are also pending in certain other European countries and in Israel ( in a total of approximately 20 countries ) .The Daimler Truck Group takes appropriate legal remedies to defend itself.It can not be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks from legal proceedings discussed above , individually or in the aggre-gate , may materially adversely impact the pro\ufb01tability , liquidity and capital resources and \ufb01nancial position of the Group or any of its segments.As legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of uncer-tainty , it is possible that a/fter their \ufb01nal resolution , some of the provisions that have been recognized for them could prove to be insu\ufb03cient . As a result , substantial additional expenditures may arise . This also applies to legal proceedings for which the Group has seen no requirement to recognize a provision.Although the \ufb01nal result of any such litigation may in\ufb02uence the Group \u2019 s earnings and cash \ufb02ows in any particular period , the Group believes that any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sustained e\ufb00ect on the Group \u2019 s \ufb01nancial position.Further information on legal proceedings is provided in E/uni00A0Note 31 of the Consolidated Financial Statements ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

The Board of Management meets on a regular basis as the Corpo-rate Sustainability Board ( \u201c CSB \u201d ) to discuss sustainability issues of importance to the company . Within the Board of Man-agement , Chairman Martin Daum is responsible for the topic of sustainability in accordance with the allocation plan . The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of Man-agement , in particular with regard to sustainability issues . At the same time , some members of the Audit Committee have expertise in the area of sustainability reporting and its auditing . The management and organizational structures established in the 2021 reporting year are intended to strategically support our sustainability goals . For this purpose , the Sustainability Steering Committee ( \u201c SSC \u201d ) was created across the board , as well as working groups for the focus topics E , S and G.Within the Legal and Compliance department , a team for sus-tainability management deals with the relevant management issues . In addition to sustainability reporting , it is also respon-sible for the further development of the sustainable business strategy , human rights compliance and stakeholder manage-ment . This function reports to the Chairman of the Board of Management via the Company \u2019 s Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer.Further relevant information can be found in the E Declaration on Corporate Governance.Principles and policies /uni2004GRI 2-23/uni2004We have anchored our values and principles in our Declaration of Principles on Social Responsibility and Human Rights , as well as in our overarching Daimler Truck Code of Conduct and in other topic-speci\ufb01c policies . By policies we mean the overarching in-house regulations of the Daimler Truck Group that provide the Group \u2019 s framework and which are directly binding for all employees and members of executive bodies de\ufb01ned in the scope of application . Speci\ufb01cations on responsibilities , process , quality , translation , approval , implementation and discontinuation , communication and documentation of policies are laid down in the Policy Management Manual . The House of Policies ( \u201c HoP \u201d ) is the o\ufb03cial platform for the entire Daimler Truck Group to create a transparent , e\ufb00ective and legally compliant policy landscape throughout the Group . All employees have access to the HoP and corresponding training courses are also o\ufb00ered . The central management and decision-making body for all sustainability topics ( Corporate Sustainability Board \u2013 \u201c CSB \u201d ) is part of the Board levels of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG . Under the leadership of the Chairman of the Board of Manage-ment , the Corporate Sustainability Board meets at least twice a year.The Sustainability Steering Committee ( \u201c SSC \u201d ) is composed of senior management level representa-tives of the segments and representatives of various functional units . The SSC , under the direction of the Chief Legal & Compliance Officer , advises \u2013 as required \u2013 on the course of action at least once a quarter and assesses the sustainability performance reported by the working groups . The processing of the focus topics from the sustain-able business strategy is organized and structured by the respective responsible departments in working groups . Progress made and any important decisions are reported to the SSC and the CSB or submitted to them for a decision./uni00A0Sustainability SteeringCommittee ( SSC ) Segments and cross functions ( Legal & Compliance , Research & Development , Production , Purchasing , Group Strategy , Human Resources , Finance & Accounting , Sales , Investor Relations as well as External Affairs and Corporate Communications ) Board of Management ( BoM ) CorporateSustainability Board ( CSB ) =B.25Governance StructureAnnual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 66B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Compliance/uni2004GRI 2-27 , 3-3 , 205-1/-2/-3 , 206-1 , 207/uni2004/uni2003/uni2003/uni2004SDG 16/uni2004We are convinced : Only those who act ethically and legally responsible will remain successful in the long term . Compli-ance with rules and a corresponding compliance culture therefore assume a high priority at Daimler Truck . Compliance and responsible corporate governance are in line with our understanding of sustainable business . Daimler Truck has therefore implemented an established Compliance Man-agement System ( \u201c CMS \u201d ) , which comprises programs and pro-cesses to comply with legal requirements and to prevent mis-conduct . Daimler Truck informs and raises the awareness of its employees on compliance issues through numerous training measures and communication campaigns.Compliance management focus areasValue-based compliance is an indispensable part of our daily business activities and means that we aim to comply with laws and internal regulations . Our intention is to encourage compli-ant conduct throughout the entire company around the world by taking speci\ufb01c measures . In the following , we explain how we are pursuing our main objectives , what are the regulations and policies providing us with orientation in this regard , and which speci\ufb01c measures we are implementing . The main objectives of our Group-wide compliance activities are : \u2013 Combating corruption\u2013 Preserving maintaining and promoting fair competition\u2013 Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory requirements\u2013 Respecting and supporting human rights\u2013 Adherence to data protection laws\u2013 Preventing money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing\u2013 Complying with sanctions and export regulationsCombating corruptionThe objective of our compliance measures is to minimize cor-ruption in all business activities . We therefore critically examine our business partners and transactions and deal with authori-ties and public o\ufb03cials in a particularly sensitive manner . An important component of our anti-corruption compliance management system is Transparency International \u2019 s Corrup-tion Perception Index . We see increased corruption risks in the area of sales activities in high-risk countries as well as in our business relations with authorized dealers and general distrib-utors worldwide.Maintaining and promoting fair competitionOur Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Program is oriented to national and international standards to ensure fair competition . It comprises a binding , globally valid Daimler Truck Group stan-dard that de\ufb01nes how matters of antitrust law are to be assessed and how the work with industry associations has to be carried out . It is based on the standards of the underlying European regulations and takes into account established legal practice at European antitrust authorities , as well as the rulings of European courts . Additional guidelines and practical toolkits are also intended to support our employees worldwide in recognizing situations that are critical under antitrust law and acting in accordance with the regulations . This is particularly important when employees deal with competitors , cooperate with dealers and general distributors , and participate in trade association work.Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory requirementsProduct compliance for Daimler Truck means compliance with technical and regulatory requirements , standards and laws that are relevant to business activities around the world.Our objective is to identify risks within the product creation process - i.e. , in product development and certi\ufb01cation \u2013 as well as in product reliability process at an early stage , includ-ing the implementation of preventative measures . In doing so , we take into account the fundamental spirit of laws and regula-tions as well as internal speci\ufb01cations and processes in devel-opment and production as well as a/fter the vehicles have been placed on the market.The Product Compliance Management System ( \u201c PCMS \u201d ) de\ufb01nes principles , structures and processes in order to pro-vide our employees with certainty and guidance , especially in terms of challenging questions on how to interpret technical regulations . Furthermore , the PCMS also includes minimum standards for handling our products in the \ufb01eld regarding safety , regulatory conformity and emissions issues.Respecting and supporting human rightsWe are strongly committed to respect and support human rights and we also expect this from our business partners throughout the value chain . With our Human Rights Compli-ance Management System ( \u201c Human Rights CMS \u201d ) , we pursue a systematic approach to ful\ufb01lling our human rights due dili-gence obligations . The Human Rights CMS is based on interna-tionally recognized standards , such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ( \u201c UNGPs \u201d ) , which are the basis for regulatory and legislative business and human rights e\ufb00orts worldwide.As part of the CMS , we systematically review on a risk basis whether human rights are respected in our controlled Group companies and in our supply chain , and have de\ufb01ned various measures , both to prevent and minimize potential adverse impacts on human rights through our companies and our busi-ness activities , and to remedy them . Further information can be found in the chapter E/uni00A0Human rights . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 67B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Adhering to data protection lawsAt Daimler Truck , data and the systematic evaluation of data are the basis for new business models , innovative technologies and e\ufb03cient processes . However , data not only opens up busi-ness opportunities , but its handling requires special care as comprehensive data protection requirements apply both in Europe and globally.In the year under review , we at Daimler Truck adopted a com-mitment to data responsibility which de\ufb01nes a clear framework on how we handle data based on the three guiding principles of \u201c added value for the customer \u201d , \u201c business potential \u201d and \u201c responsible use of data \u201d .The Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer performs the tasks de\ufb01ned by law to comply with data protection regulations.Daimler Truck \u2019 s \u201c Global Data and Information Policy \u201d lays the foundation for responsible and legally compliant handling of information and data worldwide . It de\ufb01nes a binding minimum standard for all Group units . Besides that , the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the applicable local data protection laws are to be considered.At the same time , our Data Compliance Management System supports the Group in systematically planning , implementing , and continuously monitoring measures to ensure compliance with the data protection requirements.Daimler Truck has established a central reporting procedure for all information security incidents : The Information Security Incident Management Process . Employees and contractors are instructed to report all potential personal data breaches and information security violations via this process . During the year under review , a small number of cases were reported to the responsible data protection authorities . This did not result in any o\ufb03cial measures against the company.The contact details of the Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer are pub-licly available . Customers with data protection concerns can always contact the Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer . In the year under review , Daimler Truck did not have any cases in which data protection supervisory authorities took action following a cus-tomer complaint.Preventing money laundering and financing of terrorismThe purpose of compliance in the prevention of money launder-ing and terrorist \ufb01nancing is both to prevent the placement of funds from criminal transactions into the legal economic cycle and the \ufb01nancing of terrorist associations via transactions with Daimler Truck . Therefore , we have implemented global mini-mum standards , processes and safeguards throughout the Group to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws . Daimler Truck has appointed a Group Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cer . He ensures compliance across divisions at Daimler Truck Holding AG and all of its Group companies and is respon-sible for Group-wide standards and processes pursuant to the German Anti-Money Laundering Act.The Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cer is assisted by two deputy Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cers . One deputy is responsible for ensuring compliance measures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing for the Industrial Business , while the other deputy is responsible for the segment Financial Services.Complying with sanctions and export regulationsA central Group unit for export control , sanctions , anti-money- laundering and dangerous goods pursues a combined compli-ance approach with the aim to ensure all applicable personal sanctions ( sanctions compliance ) and goods-related sanctions ( export control compliance ) in the best way possible through-out the Group . As a minimum standard of Daimler Truck , regardless of its applicability , the sanctions lists of the EU , the United Kingdom and the US ( including the US O\ufb03ce of Foreign Assets Control ( \u201c OFAC \u201d ) ; US Bureau of Industry and Security ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) ) are checked through an IT-system in every business transaction . Group-wide export control ensures , both through its worldwide internal policy and through its IT-supported export control management system , that applicable national and suprana-tional export control prohibitions and licensing requirements are observed for all exports or shipments of export control- relevant goods initiated by Daimler Truck or controlled majority companies.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 68B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Compliance Management SystemThrough our Compliance Management System ( \u201c CMS \u201d ) , we at Daimler Truck aim to promote compliance with regulations and policies at our company and to prevent misconduct . The mea-sures needed for this are de\ufb01ned by our compliance and legal organizations in a process that also takes the Company \u2019 s busi-ness requirements into account in an appropriate manner . The CMS consists of basic principles and measures that ensure compliant behavior throughout the Company . It is based on national and international standards and is applied on a global scale at Daimler Truck . The CMS consists of seven elements that build on one another.B.26The Daimler Truck Compliance Management System 4 . Risks5 . Program1 . Values7 . Monitoring & Improvement6 . Communication & Training2 . Objectives3 . Organization Corporate culture and compliance valuesWe aim to ensure that all employees are aware of and comply with the applicable Code of Conduct and act responsibly , with integrity and in compliance with the rules . Our Group-wide Code of Conduct serves as a general benchmark for us : It sets out the guidelines for our actions and helps us to make the right decisions . The policy is binding for all employees of the controlled Group companies of Daimler Truck Holding AG , is available in ten languages and centrally . In 2022 , the Code of Conduct was revised with the help of employees and aligned with the \u201c Purpose Principles \u201d of Daimler Truck . It was pub-lished at the beginning of February 2023.Compliance objectives The objectives of the compliance program are de\ufb01ned and under the responsibility of the Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer and the Compliance Board on the basis of the compli-ance strategy . The compliance strategy is derived from the corporate objectives as well as from the applicable laws , regu-lations , voluntary commitments and the \u201c Purpose Principles \u201d of Daimler Truck . For the individual compliance areas , this means minimizing corruption risks , antitrust risks , export control risks , risks from money laundering and violations of sanctions and terror lists , data protection , product conformity and human rights as well as speci\ufb01c environmental risks.Compliance organizationThe compliance organization of the Daimler Truck Group is organized regionally and along the functions . In this way , it can provide e\ufb00ective support \u2013 for example , through guidelines and recommendations . Functional or regional contacts are available for this purpose . Therefore , a global network of local contacts ensures that our compliance standards are upheld . The network supports the management of the Group compa-nies in implementing our compliance program locally . In addi-tion , the Compliance Board manages overarching issues and monitors whether our measures are e\ufb00ective . The Board has the task of responding at an early stage to changes in business models and in the business environment , picking-up on regula-tory developments and continuously developing the CMS . The Compliance Board is composed of representatives of the Com-pliance and Legal departments , meets regularly and is chaired by the Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer . He reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG and reports regularly to the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG , to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and to the Group Risk Management Committee . From the Company \u2019 s perspec-tive , the compliance network \u2019 s independence from the seg-ments is assured by the direct reporting line to Legal and Com-pliance department and to the Chairman of the Board of Management . Compliance risksDaimler Truck systematically reviews and evaluates all con-trolled Group companies and majority shareholdings globally and its own central units on a regular basis in order to mini-mize compliance risks . In doing so , centrally available data is accessed and , if necessary , local information . The results of the regular compliance risk evaluation form the basis of our risk controlling . We use these to implement targeted risk-mini-mizing measures worldwide . This risk management approach serves as a framework for all compliance \ufb01elds . The risk analy-sis for Daimler Truck , which is valid for \ufb01nancial year 2022 , was carried out before the spin-o\ufb00 from the former Daimler AG at the end of 2021 and forms the basis of our compliance risk management . The compliance risk management processes were adopted by Daimler Truck a/fter the spin-o\ufb00 and adapted to its requirements in the reporting year . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 69B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck BPO Compliance programDaimler Truck \u2019 s compliance program comprises elements such as the Business Practices O\ufb03ce , business partner due diligence processes , compliance contractual clauses and other measures tailored to the respective compliance \ufb01eld in order to minimize risks and counteract violations of laws and rules . The individual measures are derived from the \ufb01ndings of our systematic compliance risk analysis . In this respect , we focus on , among other things : Continuous enhancement of aware-ness of compliance and adherence to relevant processes , con-sistent follow-up of reports of misconduct , and the formulation of clear requirements for the conduct of our business partners.Reporting of rule violations via the BPO whistleblower system/uni2004GRI 2-27/uni2004The whistleblower system Business Practices O\ufb03ce ( \u201c BPO \u201d ) enables employees of Daimler Truck as well as business part-ners and third parties around the world to report violations of regulations . Information can be submitted by email , post or by using a reporting form . In addition , external toll-free hotlines are available in Brazil , Japan , South Africa and the US . Reports can also be submitted anonymously if local laws permit this . In Germany , a neutral external intermediary is available for whis-tleblowers as an additional contact point . Reports to the BPO whistleblower system alert us to potential risks for the Group and its employees . This can prevent damage.A globally valid corporate policy de\ufb01nes BPO procedures and the corresponding responsibilities . Its aim is to ensure a fair and transparent procedure that takes both the principle of pro-portionality for the person concerned and the protection of the whistleblower into account . The policy also serves as the standard by which we at Daimler Truck judge breaches of regulations and decide on consequences . If , a/fter an initial risk-based assessment , a noti\ufb01cation is classi\ufb01ed as a violation of the rules with a low risk for the Company , the BPO transfers the case to the responsible department , for example Human Resources , Corporate Secu-rity , or Corporate Data Protection . The relevant department follows up on the noti\ufb01cation and clari\ufb01es the case under its own responsibility . Rule violations with a low risk for the Com-pany include , for example , the/ft , embezzlement or personal enrichment with a value of less than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 provided that they do not fall into the category of corruption.If the BPO classi\ufb01es a noti\ufb01cation as a high-risk breach of reg-ulations , a/fter a risk-based initial assessment , it then refers the case to an investigative unit . The BPO provides support for the subsequent investigation until the case is closed . Examples of high-risk rule violations include o\ufb00enses related to corrup-tion , breaches of antitrust law , and violations of anti-money laundering regulations , as well as violations of binding techni-cal provisions or violations in connection with environmental regulations . Cases of sexual harassment , human rights viola-tions , discrimination and racism are also among the high-risk rule violations . In order to constantly increase trust in our BPO whistleblower system and make it even better known to our employees , we are reporting and raising awareness about the BPO through a variety of communication measures .

Among the newly opened cases , two fell into the category of \u201c corruption ( pas-sive ) \u201d , two in the category of \u201c severe cases of sexual harass-ment \u201d and two in the category of \u201c severe injuries to physical and psychological integrity \u201d . A further eight cases fell in the category of \u201c the/ft ( over \u20ac100,000 ) \u201d , four in the category of \u201c damage to reputation \u201d and one in the category of \u201c other high risks \u201d .In the 2022 reporting year , a total of 15 cases classi\ufb01ed as \u201c applicable/closed ( partially ) with merit \u201d were closed . In these 15 cases , a speci\ufb01c initial suspicion had been con\ufb01rmed . Three of these cases were in the category of \u201c the/ft ( over \u20ac100,000 ) , \u201d nine in the category of \u201c damages ( over \u20ac100,000 ) , \u201d and three in the category of \u201c severe cases of sexual harassment. \u201d The company decides here on appropriate measures in terms of proportionality and fairness . In the year under review , person-nel measures included summary dismissals , disciplinary warn-ings and warnings with a reduction in variable remuneration , suspensions and voluntary termination.Further information and contact details can be found on our w/uni00A0Website.Sales partners and suppliers acting with integrityIn this regard , beyond the Group companies , we also formulate clear requirements for our business partners , because conduct with integrity and in compliance with rules is a prerequisite for trusting cooperation . When selecting our direct business part-ners , we therefore pay close attention to ensure that they com-ply with the law and that they pay the same attention in the supply chain . Our expectations of them have been set out in detail in the Business Partner Standards , which were revised during the reporting year and which we hand out to our busi-ness partners . In the Business Partner Standards , we also summarize all the requirements we place on our suppliers for sustainable action and formulate our expectations with regard to working conditions , respect and support human rights , the environment and safety , and compliance . Further require-ments can be found in our \u201c Daimler Truck Special Terms \u201d ( order conditions ) and the compliance contractual clauses . We also provide our business partners with a speci\ufb01cally devel-oped Compliance Awareness Module . The module raises awareness of current requirements and o\ufb00ers our suppliers and sales partners assistance in dealing with potential compli-ance risks . In accordance with the United Nations Guiding Prin-ciples on Business and Human Rights , we are working to ensure that business partners , especially direct suppliers , also respect human rights . Besides this , we are committed to ensuring that this is also the case with indirect suppliers and are taking appropriate measures . We review direct business partners as part of risk-based due diligence processes . In the year under review , we audited all new sales partners . In addition , we use a permanent monitor-ing process to review all current sales partners with the aim of identifying possible conduct violations by sales partners . In the year under review , we also further developed our globally standardized and risk-based procedures for selecting and cooperating with suppliers , particularly in light of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . Further information can be found on the w/uni00A0Website for our suppliers and in the chapters E/uni00A0Green supply chain and E/uni00A0Human rights.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 71B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Internal information , communication and training measuresDaimler Truck o\ufb00ers a comprehensive range of training courses on compliance topics . Training needs are determined on a regular basis and adjustments as well as enhancements were carried out . The contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respec-tive target group . A web-based and target group-oriented training program is available for employees in administrative areas , consisting of a range of mandatory modules . Employees from production and production-related areas can voluntarily take part in the training program . The training modules are assigned when an employee is hired , promoted or transferred to a function that involves an increased risk . The web-based training measures are available worldwide via a Learning Management System ( \u201c LMS \u201d ) . We are supplementing our web-based training program with face-to-face training , some of which we conducted in digital form in 2022 . We also o\ufb00er information and quali\ufb01cation measures for supervisory and management functions . As part of an executive onboarding program , we are providing information on legal and compli-ance topics in order to assist newly appointed Supervisory Board members and members of the executive management of the Group companies in their new role .

Centrally available data and , if necessary , local information is accessed . References to non-e\ufb00ective implementation of measures are recorded as part of monitoring and measures are de\ufb01ned for this purpose . If required by changing risks or new legal require-ments , we adapt our processes and measures in the CMS.The monitoring results and other possible measures are evalu-ated and approved by the Compliance Board . The compliance risk and monitoring process is carried out at Daimler Truck for all speci\ufb01ed compliance \ufb01elds . Compliance \ufb01elds that are in the process of being set up are subject to an adequacy check . Moreover , compliance programs and processes along estab-lished areas are examined in regard to their e\ufb00ectiveness . /uni25B4In the reporting year , the described monitoring process and the annual adequacy and e\ufb00ectiveness review did not reveal any indications that the compliance program , processes or measures decided upon would not be appropriate or e\ufb00ective in the context of the company \u2019 s risk situation./uni25BE Furthermore , KPMG AG Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft , Berlin , audited the CMS of the former Daimler AG for anti-cor-ruption , antitrust and technical compliance ( \u201c tCMS \u201d ) in accor-dance with Auditing Standard 980 of the German Institute of Public Auditors . The audits were geared to appropriateness , implementation and e\ufb00ectiveness , and were successfully com-pleted for the former Daimler AG , for CMS anti-corruption in 2019 , for tCMS with a focus on emissions relevance in 2020 , and for CMS antitrust in 2021 as a re-audit a/fter the initial audit in 2016 . In 2019 , the design of the Data CMS was also audited . Selected units of Daimler Truck AG also participated in the decentralized e\ufb00ectiveness audit.Risk and opportunity management /uni2004GRI 2-25/uni2004Risk and opportunity management is an integral part of the Group-wide planning , management and reporting process . It is intended to support the achievement of the Company \u2019 s goals in a sustainable manner and to raise awareness of risks in the Company . The ESG-related risks and opportunities that are linked to our own business activities , products , and services of Daimler Truck and that could very probably have serious nega-tive impact on the non-\ufb01nancial aspects with regard to the CSR Directive Implementation Act ( \u201c CSR-RUG \u201d ) can be found in the overall assessment of the risk and opportunity situation in the risk and opportunity report of the combined manage-ment report . There was no occurrence of serious non-\ufb01nancial risks in the year under review . Detailed information can be found in the E Risk and Opportunity Report . /uni25B4Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 73B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Tax obligations /uni2004GRI 207/uni2004Daimler Truck sees itself as a responsible company that strives to comply with its worldwide tax obligations . In this context , we want to live up to our corporate values and to our social and ethical responsibility . As part of the tax strategy of the Group , we pursue the follow-ing principles in particular , taking into account the economic and social impacts and in accordance with the corporate and business strategy : \u2013 Through our actions , we want to ensure that the tax obliga-tions of Group \u2019 s companies are met and integrity standards are maintained through measures such as e\ufb03cient , high-quality and reliable expertise , processes , systems , methods and controls.\u2013 We live an active risk management for the Group and its operational employees through an appropriate Tax Compli-ance Management System ( \u201c Tax CMS \u201c ) . \u2013 We pursue legal , active and non-aggressive tax planning based on economic grounds ( \u201c tax follows business \u201d ) . This means that we , as a company , comply with our responsibility as a taxpayer . We also strive to work cooperatively , transpar-ently , and constructively with the tax authorities . In the pro-cess , we maintain our legal standpoints and defend our interests wherever we believe such actions are appropriate and legitimate . The Group \u2019 s tax strategy de\ufb01nes the limits of our actions , and this strategy is further speci\ufb01ed and imple-mented by means of organizational and content-related policies , provisions , and instructions.The worldwide responsibility for tax is allocated to the Head of Tax of Daimler Truck . Signi\ufb01cant tax-relevant decisions are made in the Tax Compliance and Tax Risk Committee ( \u201c TCRC \u201d ) , which the Chief Financial O\ufb03cer is a member of . The TCRC is also kept informed on an ongoing basis about material tax issues . The tax policies regulate the responsibilities , tasks and duties of the persons entrusted with tax matters at Daimler Truck . In addition , they provide concrete implementation guidelines for meeting relevant legal obligations and enhance our employees \u2019 awareness of tax-related issues . In accordance with the Group \u2019 s Code of Conduct , intentional violations of external and/or internal tax requirements must be reported and fol-lowed up . The same applies to failure to correct incorrectly processed transactions.The Group-wide Tax CMS is a de\ufb01ned sub-area of our general CMS and is the responsibility of the Tax department . Tax risk management is also part of the Tax CMS . Its function is to monitor and check whether tax obligations are met . This risk management system , which is consistent across the Group , serves to identify and reduce tax risks within Daimler Truck and associated personal risks of the employees acting on behalf of the Group . It comprises numerous measures , such as ongoing monitoring or integration of tax risks in the internal control system and in the Group-wide risk management pro-cess in accordance with the risk management policy . In the year under review , we were not aware of any signi\ufb01cant viola-tions of tax laws that would have resulted in criminal proceed-ings.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 74B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 101B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler TruckEnvironmental objective 4 - \u201c Transition to a circular economy \u201d \u2013 Activity 3.3 : The possibility of using secondary raw materials and the possibility of a design for easy disassembly and durability must be taken into account for the relevant vehi-cles . In addition , hazardous substances must be traceable and a waste management established at the sites . In this context , various Group-internal guidelines and standards apply as well as , in individual cases , further suitable evi-dence . The issue of durability is anchored , for example , in the product development process . The \u201c Group Standard for Waste Management \u201d de\ufb01nes waste management across the Group . \u2013 Activities 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.6 : The criterion requires the exis-tence of waste management measures , in particular at the end of a vehicle \u2019 s life cycle.\u2013 Activities 6.5 and 6.6 : De\ufb01ned quotas of recyclable or reus-able materials in the products must be complied with . If the quotas determined in accordance with the speci\ufb01cations reach the required threshold values , the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful\ufb01lled . Environmental objective 5 - \u201c Pollution prevention and control \u201d - Activity 3.3 : The criterion is based on Appendix C of the Del-egated Regulation ( EU ) 2021/2139 . Appendix C refers to var-ious European regulations out of the chemicals legislation . The de\ufb01ned substances are subject to restrictions on manu-facture , placing on the market and use , both in terms of use at the sites and in the products . There are di\ufb03culties in interpreting the vague legal term \u201c essential for society \u201d . \u2013 Activities 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.6 : Compliance with certain tire cate-gories in terms of rolling resistance and rolling noise shall be demonstrated . In the reporting year , appropriate analyses were performed for the relevant vehicles to provide the required evidence . If information on the tires is available and the corresponding classes are adhered to , the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful\ufb01lled . Environmental objective 6 - \u201c Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems \u201d - Activity 3.3 : The criterion refers to Appendix D of Delegated Regulation ( EU ) 2021/2139 , which de\ufb01nes requirements for the protection of biodiversity and biodiversity-sensitive areas in the vicinity of the sites . As part of the environmen-tal due diligence audits , compliance with environmental per-mits is veri\ufb01ed , among other aspects . The impact on nearby , sensitive areas is also examined . If required , measures are derived ( for details , see chapter E Preventing pollution ) .During the assessment , the relevant technical screening crite-ria were analyzed , interpreted , the results documented and substantiated by corresponding evidence documents and cal-culations.Minimum safeguards As part of the audit of compliance with the minimum safe-guards , the following topics were analyzed centrally : - Human rights , including labor rights ; - Corruption and bribery ; - Taxation ; \u2013 Fair competition.No increased risk was identi\ufb01ed and assessed in this regard for the 2022 reporting year . For each potential risk area , pre-ventive and , if necessary , remedial measures are already in place . As part of the due diligence processes , it was possible to demonstrate that there are no convictions in any of the four subject areas ( for details , see chapter E Social ) Reporting on the three performance indicatorsReporting on the KPIs required under the Taxonomy Regulation for turnover , CapEx and OpEx is shown in tables \uf0e4/uni00A0B.52 , \uf0e4/uni00A0B.53 and \uf0e4/uni00A0B.54 . All activities are fully assigned to the envi-ronmental objective of \u201c climate change mitigation \u201d . Further-more , all activities can be clearly assigned to the respective economic activity according to the Taxonomy Regulation . This avoids double counting in the calculation of the overall perfor-mance indicators .

The reporting date for the collection of quantitative data was December 31 , 2022 . Isolated deviations are marked in each case.During the reporting period , further organizational changes occurred due to the spin-o\ufb00 of Daimler Truck AG in Decem-ber 2021 from the former Daimler AG compared to the 2021 Report , so that comparability of the data with the previous Sustainability Report is only partially possible.We see more integrated reporting as another important mech-anism for further developing our sustainable business strategy . For this reason , we have decided to integrate aspects of sus-tainability into the Annual Report for the reporting year and have refrained from a separate sustainability report./uni25BE EU taxonomy Companies are obliged to apply the Taxonomy Regulation if they are required to prepare a non-\ufb01nancial statement in accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the EU Accounting Directive , implemented by Section 289b Subsection 1 and Sec-tion 315b Subsection 1 of the HGB . According to this , Daimler Truck has been obliged to apply the Taxonomy Regulation since the 2021 reporting year . Daimler Truck applied the reporting requirements in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation for the 2021 reporting year and exercised the relief provisions for the year of initial application , according to which only the tax-onomy eligibility had to be reported . For the 2022 reporting year , Daimler Truck is publishing the full disclosures in accor-dance with the Taxonomy Regulation for the \ufb01rst time . Thus , in addition to the proportions of taxonomy-eligible and non-eligi-ble economic activities , the proportions of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in turnover , investments ( \u201c CapEx \u201d ) and operating expenditure ( \u201c OpEx \u201d ) must also be disclosed . Production-related energy and environmental data/uni2004GRI 305-1/-2/-4/uni2004The data in the Environment section is based on the Group structure as of the reporting date of December 31 , 2022 . This includes all production sites and selected test tracks and R & D sites of the Group companies controlled by Daimler Truck as well as selected joint ventures with 50 % participation . Production sites include all \u201c Completely Built Up \u201d ( \u201c CBU \u201d ) , \u201c Completely Knocked Down \u201d ( \u201c CKD \u201d ) and Remanufacturing ( \u201c Reman \u201d ) sites . There has been no retroactive adjustment of the \ufb01gures for 2020 and 2021.The environmental data is collected from the sites in our envi-ronmental data system . If in individual cases no actual values are available in February , estimates are made on the basis of the previous year \u2019 s values and the change in production . Air emissions are measured regularly and extrapolated to the year , and VOC emissions are also calculated on the basis of various input or output parameters.Daimler Truck calculates and documents its CO2 emissions according to the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Stan-dard 2004 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative , in accor-dance with the categories Scope 1 and Scope 2 . Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are reported in accordance with the Con-trol approach of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.Documented are all direct CO2 emissions from our Company \u2019 s own sources ( Scope 1 ) , indirect emissions resulting from the generation of the purchased electricity and district heat ( Scope 2 ) .Scope 1 : We calculate our direct emissions from the combus- tion of fuels , heating oil , natural gas , lique\ufb01ed petroleum gas , and coal with \ufb01xed CO2 emission factors as speci\ufb01ed by the Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 127B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 143B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportWarranty and goodwill cases could arise in the Daimler Truck Group if the quality of products does not meet the require-ments , regulations are not fully complied with , or support in the event of problems and product care can not be provided in the required form . Such warranty and goodwill cases as well as quality problems both with components in vehicles and in con-nection with technical innovations on vehicles that require adjustments can lead to \ufb01nancial burdens . Possible claims in connection with such risks are examined and , if necessary , appropriate measures are initiated for the a\ufb00ected products.Information technology risks and opportunitiesThe systematically pursued digitalization strategy opens up new opportunities for Daimler Truck and allows it to enhance customer bene\ufb01ts and the value of the Company . Neverthe-less , the high penetration level of information technology ( \u201c IT \u201d ) in all business areas also harbors risks for business and pro-duction processes as well as for their services and products.The ever-growing threat posed by cybercrime and the spread of aggressive malicious code give rise to risks that can a\ufb00ect the availability , integrity and con\ufb01dentiality of information and IT-supported operating resources . Despite extensive precau-tions , in the worst-case scenario , this can lead to a temporary interruption of IT-supported business processes with severe negative e\ufb00ects on the Group \u2019 s earnings . In addition , the loss or misuse of sensitive data may under certain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation . In particular , applicable regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Directive ( \u201c EU-GDPR \u201d ) may , among other things , give rise to claims by third parties and result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties with an impact on earnings.For the globally active Daimler Truck Group and its comprehen-sive business and production processes , it is of vital impor-tance that information is available , up-to-date , complete and correct and that it can be exchanged as needed . The Group \u2019 s internal IT security framework is based on international stan-dards and uses industrial standards and good practice as part of its protective measures . New regulatory requirements for cyber security and cyber security management systems are taken into account in the further development of our processes and policies.Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable IT infrastructure must be used to protect information . Cyber threats must be identi\ufb01ed over the entire lifecycle of applications and IT sys-tems , and dealt with in line with their criticality . Particular attention is paid to risks that could , at worst , result in an inter-ruption of business processes due to IT system failures and/or the loss and corruption of data . The advancing digitalization and connectivity of production equipment is supplemented by coordinated technical and organizational security measures.Due to growing demands concerning the con\ufb01dentiality , integ-rity and availability of data , Daimler Truck has implemented a wide range of preventive and corrective measures in order to minimize the associated risks and limit possible damage . For example , the Group reduces potential interruptions of operat-ing processes in data centers by means of mirrored data sets , decentralized data storage , outsourced data backups and IT systems designed for high availability . Emergency plans are developed and employees are trained and regularly sensitized in order to maintain operating capability . Speci\ufb01c threats are analyzed , and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active Cyber Security & Response Center . The protection of products and services against the danger of falling prey to hacker attacks and cybercrime is under constant development.Personnel risks and opportunitiesThe Daimler Truck Group is dependent on good relationships with its employees , their trade unions as well as employee representative bodies and stakeholders and is party to a number of collective agreements , some of which impose obli-gations and restrictions on the Daimler Truck Group in connec-tion with reorganizations , restructurings or similar corporate actions and which it may not be able to extend , renew or replace in a favorable or timely manner or at all . Any deteriora-tion of the relationships with trade unions , works councils and other employee representative bodies could adversely impact the Daimler Truck Group \u2019 s business operations . The Group could face strikes or other types of con\ufb02icts with trade unions , works councils or its employees in the future . Any such strikes , con\ufb02icts , work stoppages or other industrial actions may dis-rupt the Group \u2019 s production and sales activities , damage its reputation and adversely a\ufb00ect its customer relations . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 144B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportCompetition for highly quali\ufb01ed employees and managers con-tinues to be very \ufb01erce in the industry and the regions in which Daimler Truck operates . The future success of the Daimler Truck Group also depends on the extent to which it succeeds in recruiting , integrating and retaining specialist sta\ufb00 . The established human resources instruments take such personnel risks into consideration . A particular focus of human resources management is the targeted personnel development and fur-ther training of the Company \u2019 s workforce . In order to remain successful as a company , we continuously develop the way we work together and optimize our management culture.Demographic developments are forcing the Group to deal with changes caused by an aging workforce and to secure a skilled new generation of specialists and future executives . Generation management addresses this by implementing mea-sures that do justice to the scope of the issue . We counter eco-nomic , market and competitive \ufb02uctuations with the estab-lished time and \ufb02exibility instruments , enabling reactions that are suitable for the respective situation . Efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial for the Group to maintain its competitiveness and improve its prof-itability . The Group is in the midst of implementing a number of operational performance and cost-saving initiatives to address \ufb01xed and variable costs a\ufb00ecting pro\ufb01tability . These opera-tional performance and cost-saving measures , or components thereof , may not deliver the intended bene\ufb01ts within the time the Group targets . This may result in implementation costs in excess of those originally budgeted by the Group and the actual results of the initiatives may di\ufb00er from the targets . If the targeted operational performance and cost-saving mea-sures are not fully realized or achieved within the intended time , this could have an adverse e\ufb00ect on the Group \u2019 s pro\ufb01t margins.Risks and opportunities related to associated companies and joint venturesCooperation with partners in associated companies and joint ventures is of vital importance for Daimler Truck , in the trans-formation towards both zero-emission mobility and compre-hensive digitalization . Particularly in the case of new technolo-gies , associated companies can help boost synergy e\ufb00ects and improve cost structures in order to successfully face the com-petition in the commercial vehicle industry.The Daimler Truck Group generally participates in the risks and opportunities of associated companies and joint ventures in line with its equity interest . It is also subject to share-price risks and opportunities if those companies are listed on the stock exchange.The remeasurement of an interest in an associated company can result in risks and opportunities related to the invest-ment \u2019 s carrying amount for the segment to which the associ-ated company belongs . Risks can also arise from ongoing busi-ness activities , especially through the integration of employees , technologies and products . The Group \u2019 s business and legal interests may not always be aligned with those of its associated companies and joint ventures and any of the Group \u2019 s current or future associated companies or joint ven-tures may fail to be successful , achieve their planned objec-tives and meet their targeted timelines . In addition , further \ufb01nancial obligations or additional \ufb01nancing requirements could arise . Associated companies are subject to a monitoring pro-cess so that , if necessary , decisions can be promptly made on whether or not measures should be taken to support or secure pro\ufb01tability . The recoverable amounts of investments in asso-ciated companies are also regularly monitored . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 148B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportViolations of regulations on anti-corruption , antitrust law , sanc-tions , export control , anti-money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing , product requirements , data protection and the han-dling of hazardous goods are sanctioned , e.g . with regulatory \ufb01nes or criminal consequences . In addition , any violation can lead to negative media coverage and a\ufb00ect the Group \u2019 s reputa-tion . Risks from legal proceedingsThe subsidiaries of Daimler Truck Holding AG ( especially Daimler Truck AG ) are confronted with various legal proceed-ings , claims as well as governmental investigations and orders ( legal proceedings ) on a large number of topics . These include , for example , vehicle conformity and vehicle safety , dealer , sup-plier and other contractual relationships , \ufb01nancial services , industrial property rights ( in particular patent infringement suits ) , warranty claims , and antitrust proceedings ( including claims for damages ) . If the outcome of such legal proceedings is negative for the Daimler Truck Group or such proceedings are settled , the Group may be required to pay substantial com-pensatory and punitive damages or to undertake service actions , recall campaigns , monetary penalties or other costly actions . Legal proceedings and related settlements may have an impact on the Group \u2019 s reputation.Antitrust law proceedings ( including actions for damages ) Mercedes-Benz Group AG , under the former name Daimler AG the former parent entity of Daimler Truck AG , was subject to an antitrust proceeding initiated by the European Commission . In July 2016 , the European Commission issued a settlement decision against the former Daimler AG and four other Euro-pean truck manufacturers for their participation in anti-com-petitive behavior in violation of European antitrust rules with regard to pricing and passing on the costs of compliance with strict emission rules for trucks . The European Commission found that Daimler AG participated in the relevant arrange-ments from January 17 , 1997 to January 18 , 2011 . The individual \ufb01ne imposed on Daimler AG by the European Commission \u2019 s settlement decision amounted to \u20ac1.09 billion and was fully paid in 2016.Following the settlement decision by the European Commis-sion , legal actions , class actions and other forms of legal redress for damages by direct and indirect truck customers have been \ufb01led or initiated in several jurisdictions . Damage claims could result in substantial liabilities for the Daimler Truck Group as well as signi\ufb01cant costs expended for defense measures , which may have a material adverse e\ufb00ect on the Daimler Truck Group \u2019 s operations and its liquidity and capital resources.In relation to the cartel infringement described above , most substantial claims ( including certain types of class actions or aggregator claims ) are pending or have been initiated in Ger-many , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and Spain . Claims are also pending in certain other European countries and in Israel ( in a total of approximately 20 countries ) .The Daimler Truck Group takes appropriate legal remedies to defend itself.It can not be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks from legal proceedings discussed above , individually or in the aggre-gate , may materially adversely impact the pro\ufb01tability , liquidity and capital resources and \ufb01nancial position of the Group or any of its segments.As legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of uncer-tainty , it is possible that a/fter their \ufb01nal resolution , some of the provisions that have been recognized for them could prove to be insu\ufb03cient . As a result , substantial additional expenditures may arise . This also applies to legal proceedings for which the Group has seen no requirement to recognize a provision.Although the \ufb01nal result of any such litigation may in\ufb02uence the Group \u2019 s earnings and cash \ufb02ows in any particular period , the Group believes that any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sustained e\ufb00ect on the Group \u2019 s \ufb01nancial position.Further information on legal proceedings is provided in E/uni00A0Note 31 of the Consolidated Financial Statements ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short,precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

The Board of Management meets on a regular basis as the Corpo-rate Sustainability Board ( \u201c CSB \u201d ) to discuss sustainability issues of importance to the company . Within the Board of Man-agement , Chairman Martin Daum is responsible for the topic of sustainability in accordance with the allocation plan . The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Board of Man-agement , in particular with regard to sustainability issues . At the same time , some members of the Audit Committee have expertise in the area of sustainability reporting and its auditing . The management and organizational structures established in the 2021 reporting year are intended to strategically support our sustainability goals . For this purpose , the Sustainability Steering Committee ( \u201c SSC \u201d ) was created across the board , as well as working groups for the focus topics E , S and G.Within the Legal and Compliance department , a team for sus-tainability management deals with the relevant management issues . In addition to sustainability reporting , it is also respon-sible for the further development of the sustainable business strategy , human rights compliance and stakeholder manage-ment . This function reports to the Chairman of the Board of Management via the Company \u2019 s Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer.Further relevant information can be found in the E Declaration on Corporate Governance.Principles and policies /uni2004GRI 2-23/uni2004We have anchored our values and principles in our Declaration of Principles on Social Responsibility and Human Rights , as well as in our overarching Daimler Truck Code of Conduct and in other topic-speci\ufb01c policies . By policies we mean the overarching in-house regulations of the Daimler Truck Group that provide the Group \u2019 s framework and which are directly binding for all employees and members of executive bodies de\ufb01ned in the scope of application . Speci\ufb01cations on responsibilities , process , quality , translation , approval , implementation and discontinuation , communication and documentation of policies are laid down in the Policy Management Manual . The House of Policies ( \u201c HoP \u201d ) is the o\ufb03cial platform for the entire Daimler Truck Group to create a transparent , e\ufb00ective and legally compliant policy landscape throughout the Group . All employees have access to the HoP and corresponding training courses are also o\ufb00ered . The central management and decision-making body for all sustainability topics ( Corporate Sustainability Board \u2013 \u201c CSB \u201d ) is part of the Board levels of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG . Under the leadership of the Chairman of the Board of Manage-ment , the Corporate Sustainability Board meets at least twice a year.The Sustainability Steering Committee ( \u201c SSC \u201d ) is composed of senior management level representa-tives of the segments and representatives of various functional units . The SSC , under the direction of the Chief Legal & Compliance Officer , advises \u2013 as required \u2013 on the course of action at least once a quarter and assesses the sustainability performance reported by the working groups . The processing of the focus topics from the sustain-able business strategy is organized and structured by the respective responsible departments in working groups . Progress made and any important decisions are reported to the SSC and the CSB or submitted to them for a decision./uni00A0Sustainability SteeringCommittee ( SSC ) Segments and cross functions ( Legal & Compliance , Research & Development , Production , Purchasing , Group Strategy , Human Resources , Finance & Accounting , Sales , Investor Relations as well as External Affairs and Corporate Communications ) Board of Management ( BoM ) CorporateSustainability Board ( CSB ) =B.25Governance StructureAnnual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 66B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Compliance/uni2004GRI 2-27 , 3-3 , 205-1/-2/-3 , 206-1 , 207/uni2004/uni2003/uni2003/uni2004SDG 16/uni2004We are convinced : Only those who act ethically and legally responsible will remain successful in the long term . Compli-ance with rules and a corresponding compliance culture therefore assume a high priority at Daimler Truck . Compliance and responsible corporate governance are in line with our understanding of sustainable business . Daimler Truck has therefore implemented an established Compliance Man-agement System ( \u201c CMS \u201d ) , which comprises programs and pro-cesses to comply with legal requirements and to prevent mis-conduct . Daimler Truck informs and raises the awareness of its employees on compliance issues through numerous training measures and communication campaigns.Compliance management focus areasValue-based compliance is an indispensable part of our daily business activities and means that we aim to comply with laws and internal regulations . Our intention is to encourage compli-ant conduct throughout the entire company around the world by taking speci\ufb01c measures . In the following , we explain how we are pursuing our main objectives , what are the regulations and policies providing us with orientation in this regard , and which speci\ufb01c measures we are implementing . The main objectives of our Group-wide compliance activities are : \u2013 Combating corruption\u2013 Preserving maintaining and promoting fair competition\u2013 Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory requirements\u2013 Respecting and supporting human rights\u2013 Adherence to data protection laws\u2013 Preventing money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing\u2013 Complying with sanctions and export regulationsCombating corruptionThe objective of our compliance measures is to minimize cor-ruption in all business activities . We therefore critically examine our business partners and transactions and deal with authori-ties and public o\ufb03cials in a particularly sensitive manner . An important component of our anti-corruption compliance management system is Transparency International \u2019 s Corrup-tion Perception Index . We see increased corruption risks in the area of sales activities in high-risk countries as well as in our business relations with authorized dealers and general distrib-utors worldwide.Maintaining and promoting fair competitionOur Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Program is oriented to national and international standards to ensure fair competition . It comprises a binding , globally valid Daimler Truck Group stan-dard that de\ufb01nes how matters of antitrust law are to be assessed and how the work with industry associations has to be carried out . It is based on the standards of the underlying European regulations and takes into account established legal practice at European antitrust authorities , as well as the rulings of European courts . Additional guidelines and practical toolkits are also intended to support our employees worldwide in recognizing situations that are critical under antitrust law and acting in accordance with the regulations . This is particularly important when employees deal with competitors , cooperate with dealers and general distributors , and participate in trade association work.Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory requirementsProduct compliance for Daimler Truck means compliance with technical and regulatory requirements , standards and laws that are relevant to business activities around the world.Our objective is to identify risks within the product creation process - i.e. , in product development and certi\ufb01cation \u2013 as well as in product reliability process at an early stage , includ-ing the implementation of preventative measures . In doing so , we take into account the fundamental spirit of laws and regula-tions as well as internal speci\ufb01cations and processes in devel-opment and production as well as a/fter the vehicles have been placed on the market.The Product Compliance Management System ( \u201c PCMS \u201d ) de\ufb01nes principles , structures and processes in order to pro-vide our employees with certainty and guidance , especially in terms of challenging questions on how to interpret technical regulations . Furthermore , the PCMS also includes minimum standards for handling our products in the \ufb01eld regarding safety , regulatory conformity and emissions issues.Respecting and supporting human rightsWe are strongly committed to respect and support human rights and we also expect this from our business partners throughout the value chain . With our Human Rights Compli-ance Management System ( \u201c Human Rights CMS \u201d ) , we pursue a systematic approach to ful\ufb01lling our human rights due dili-gence obligations . The Human Rights CMS is based on interna-tionally recognized standards , such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ( \u201c UNGPs \u201d ) , which are the basis for regulatory and legislative business and human rights e\ufb00orts worldwide.As part of the CMS , we systematically review on a risk basis whether human rights are respected in our controlled Group companies and in our supply chain , and have de\ufb01ned various measures , both to prevent and minimize potential adverse impacts on human rights through our companies and our busi-ness activities , and to remedy them . Further information can be found in the chapter E/uni00A0Human rights . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 67B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Adhering to data protection lawsAt Daimler Truck , data and the systematic evaluation of data are the basis for new business models , innovative technologies and e\ufb03cient processes . However , data not only opens up busi-ness opportunities , but its handling requires special care as comprehensive data protection requirements apply both in Europe and globally.In the year under review , we at Daimler Truck adopted a com-mitment to data responsibility which de\ufb01nes a clear framework on how we handle data based on the three guiding principles of \u201c added value for the customer \u201d , \u201c business potential \u201d and \u201c responsible use of data \u201d .The Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer performs the tasks de\ufb01ned by law to comply with data protection regulations.Daimler Truck \u2019 s \u201c Global Data and Information Policy \u201d lays the foundation for responsible and legally compliant handling of information and data worldwide . It de\ufb01nes a binding minimum standard for all Group units . Besides that , the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the applicable local data protection laws are to be considered.At the same time , our Data Compliance Management System supports the Group in systematically planning , implementing , and continuously monitoring measures to ensure compliance with the data protection requirements.Daimler Truck has established a central reporting procedure for all information security incidents : The Information Security Incident Management Process . Employees and contractors are instructed to report all potential personal data breaches and information security violations via this process . During the year under review , a small number of cases were reported to the responsible data protection authorities . This did not result in any o\ufb03cial measures against the company.The contact details of the Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer are pub-licly available . Customers with data protection concerns can always contact the Chief Data Privacy O\ufb03cer . In the year under review , Daimler Truck did not have any cases in which data protection supervisory authorities took action following a cus-tomer complaint.Preventing money laundering and financing of terrorismThe purpose of compliance in the prevention of money launder-ing and terrorist \ufb01nancing is both to prevent the placement of funds from criminal transactions into the legal economic cycle and the \ufb01nancing of terrorist associations via transactions with Daimler Truck . Therefore , we have implemented global mini-mum standards , processes and safeguards throughout the Group to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws . Daimler Truck has appointed a Group Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cer . He ensures compliance across divisions at Daimler Truck Holding AG and all of its Group companies and is respon-sible for Group-wide standards and processes pursuant to the German Anti-Money Laundering Act.The Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cer is assisted by two deputy Anti-Money Laundering O\ufb03cers . One deputy is responsible for ensuring compliance measures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist \ufb01nancing for the Industrial Business , while the other deputy is responsible for the segment Financial Services.Complying with sanctions and export regulationsA central Group unit for export control , sanctions , anti-money- laundering and dangerous goods pursues a combined compli-ance approach with the aim to ensure all applicable personal sanctions ( sanctions compliance ) and goods-related sanctions ( export control compliance ) in the best way possible through-out the Group . As a minimum standard of Daimler Truck , regardless of its applicability , the sanctions lists of the EU , the United Kingdom and the US ( including the US O\ufb03ce of Foreign Assets Control ( \u201c OFAC \u201d ) ; US Bureau of Industry and Security ( \u201c BIS \u201d ) ) are checked through an IT-system in every business transaction . Group-wide export control ensures , both through its worldwide internal policy and through its IT-supported export control management system , that applicable national and suprana-tional export control prohibitions and licensing requirements are observed for all exports or shipments of export control- relevant goods initiated by Daimler Truck or controlled majority companies.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 68B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Compliance Management SystemThrough our Compliance Management System ( \u201c CMS \u201d ) , we at Daimler Truck aim to promote compliance with regulations and policies at our company and to prevent misconduct . The mea-sures needed for this are de\ufb01ned by our compliance and legal organizations in a process that also takes the Company \u2019 s busi-ness requirements into account in an appropriate manner . The CMS consists of basic principles and measures that ensure compliant behavior throughout the Company . It is based on national and international standards and is applied on a global scale at Daimler Truck . The CMS consists of seven elements that build on one another.B.26The Daimler Truck Compliance Management System 4 . Risks5 . Program1 . Values7 . Monitoring & Improvement6 . Communication & Training2 . Objectives3 . Organization Corporate culture and compliance valuesWe aim to ensure that all employees are aware of and comply with the applicable Code of Conduct and act responsibly , with integrity and in compliance with the rules . Our Group-wide Code of Conduct serves as a general benchmark for us : It sets out the guidelines for our actions and helps us to make the right decisions . The policy is binding for all employees of the controlled Group companies of Daimler Truck Holding AG , is available in ten languages and centrally . In 2022 , the Code of Conduct was revised with the help of employees and aligned with the \u201c Purpose Principles \u201d of Daimler Truck . It was pub-lished at the beginning of February 2023.Compliance objectives The objectives of the compliance program are de\ufb01ned and under the responsibility of the Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer and the Compliance Board on the basis of the compli-ance strategy . The compliance strategy is derived from the corporate objectives as well as from the applicable laws , regu-lations , voluntary commitments and the \u201c Purpose Principles \u201d of Daimler Truck . For the individual compliance areas , this means minimizing corruption risks , antitrust risks , export control risks , risks from money laundering and violations of sanctions and terror lists , data protection , product conformity and human rights as well as speci\ufb01c environmental risks.Compliance organizationThe compliance organization of the Daimler Truck Group is organized regionally and along the functions . In this way , it can provide e\ufb00ective support \u2013 for example , through guidelines and recommendations . Functional or regional contacts are available for this purpose . Therefore , a global network of local contacts ensures that our compliance standards are upheld . The network supports the management of the Group compa-nies in implementing our compliance program locally . In addi-tion , the Compliance Board manages overarching issues and monitors whether our measures are e\ufb00ective . The Board has the task of responding at an early stage to changes in business models and in the business environment , picking-up on regula-tory developments and continuously developing the CMS . The Compliance Board is composed of representatives of the Com-pliance and Legal departments , meets regularly and is chaired by the Chief Legal and Compliance O\ufb03cer . He reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG and reports regularly to the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG , to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and to the Group Risk Management Committee . From the Company \u2019 s perspec-tive , the compliance network \u2019 s independence from the seg-ments is assured by the direct reporting line to Legal and Com-pliance department and to the Chairman of the Board of Management . Compliance risksDaimler Truck systematically reviews and evaluates all con-trolled Group companies and majority shareholdings globally and its own central units on a regular basis in order to mini-mize compliance risks . In doing so , centrally available data is accessed and , if necessary , local information . The results of the regular compliance risk evaluation form the basis of our risk controlling . We use these to implement targeted risk-mini-mizing measures worldwide . This risk management approach serves as a framework for all compliance \ufb01elds . The risk analy-sis for Daimler Truck , which is valid for \ufb01nancial year 2022 , was carried out before the spin-o\ufb00 from the former Daimler AG at the end of 2021 and forms the basis of our compliance risk management . The compliance risk management processes were adopted by Daimler Truck a/fter the spin-o\ufb00 and adapted to its requirements in the reporting year . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 69B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck BPO Compliance programDaimler Truck \u2019 s compliance program comprises elements such as the Business Practices O\ufb03ce , business partner due diligence processes , compliance contractual clauses and other measures tailored to the respective compliance \ufb01eld in order to minimize risks and counteract violations of laws and rules . The individual measures are derived from the \ufb01ndings of our systematic compliance risk analysis . In this respect , we focus on , among other things : Continuous enhancement of aware-ness of compliance and adherence to relevant processes , con-sistent follow-up of reports of misconduct , and the formulation of clear requirements for the conduct of our business partners.Reporting of rule violations via the BPO whistleblower system/uni2004GRI 2-27/uni2004The whistleblower system Business Practices O\ufb03ce ( \u201c BPO \u201d ) enables employees of Daimler Truck as well as business part-ners and third parties around the world to report violations of regulations . Information can be submitted by email , post or by using a reporting form . In addition , external toll-free hotlines are available in Brazil , Japan , South Africa and the US . Reports can also be submitted anonymously if local laws permit this . In Germany , a neutral external intermediary is available for whis-tleblowers as an additional contact point . Reports to the BPO whistleblower system alert us to potential risks for the Group and its employees . This can prevent damage.A globally valid corporate policy de\ufb01nes BPO procedures and the corresponding responsibilities . Its aim is to ensure a fair and transparent procedure that takes both the principle of pro-portionality for the person concerned and the protection of the whistleblower into account . The policy also serves as the standard by which we at Daimler Truck judge breaches of regulations and decide on consequences . If , a/fter an initial risk-based assessment , a noti\ufb01cation is classi\ufb01ed as a violation of the rules with a low risk for the Company , the BPO transfers the case to the responsible department , for example Human Resources , Corporate Secu-rity , or Corporate Data Protection . The relevant department follows up on the noti\ufb01cation and clari\ufb01es the case under its own responsibility . Rule violations with a low risk for the Com-pany include , for example , the/ft , embezzlement or personal enrichment with a value of less than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 provided that they do not fall into the category of corruption.If the BPO classi\ufb01es a noti\ufb01cation as a high-risk breach of reg-ulations , a/fter a risk-based initial assessment , it then refers the case to an investigative unit . The BPO provides support for the subsequent investigation until the case is closed . Examples of high-risk rule violations include o\ufb00enses related to corrup-tion , breaches of antitrust law , and violations of anti-money laundering regulations , as well as violations of binding techni-cal provisions or violations in connection with environmental regulations . Cases of sexual harassment , human rights viola-tions , discrimination and racism are also among the high-risk rule violations . In order to constantly increase trust in our BPO whistleblower system and make it even better known to our employees , we are reporting and raising awareness about the BPO through a variety of communication measures .

Among the newly opened cases , two fell into the category of \u201c corruption ( pas-sive ) \u201d , two in the category of \u201c severe cases of sexual harass-ment \u201d and two in the category of \u201c severe injuries to physical and psychological integrity \u201d . A further eight cases fell in the category of \u201c the/ft ( over \u20ac100,000 ) \u201d , four in the category of \u201c damage to reputation \u201d and one in the category of \u201c other high risks \u201d .In the 2022 reporting year , a total of 15 cases classi\ufb01ed as \u201c applicable/closed ( partially ) with merit \u201d were closed . In these 15 cases , a speci\ufb01c initial suspicion had been con\ufb01rmed . Three of these cases were in the category of \u201c the/ft ( over \u20ac100,000 ) , \u201d nine in the category of \u201c damages ( over \u20ac100,000 ) , \u201d and three in the category of \u201c severe cases of sexual harassment. \u201d The company decides here on appropriate measures in terms of proportionality and fairness . In the year under review , person-nel measures included summary dismissals , disciplinary warn-ings and warnings with a reduction in variable remuneration , suspensions and voluntary termination.Further information and contact details can be found on our w/uni00A0Website.Sales partners and suppliers acting with integrityIn this regard , beyond the Group companies , we also formulate clear requirements for our business partners , because conduct with integrity and in compliance with rules is a prerequisite for trusting cooperation . When selecting our direct business part-ners , we therefore pay close attention to ensure that they com-ply with the law and that they pay the same attention in the supply chain . Our expectations of them have been set out in detail in the Business Partner Standards , which were revised during the reporting year and which we hand out to our busi-ness partners . In the Business Partner Standards , we also summarize all the requirements we place on our suppliers for sustainable action and formulate our expectations with regard to working conditions , respect and support human rights , the environment and safety , and compliance . Further require-ments can be found in our \u201c Daimler Truck Special Terms \u201d ( order conditions ) and the compliance contractual clauses . We also provide our business partners with a speci\ufb01cally devel-oped Compliance Awareness Module . The module raises awareness of current requirements and o\ufb00ers our suppliers and sales partners assistance in dealing with potential compli-ance risks . In accordance with the United Nations Guiding Prin-ciples on Business and Human Rights , we are working to ensure that business partners , especially direct suppliers , also respect human rights . Besides this , we are committed to ensuring that this is also the case with indirect suppliers and are taking appropriate measures . We review direct business partners as part of risk-based due diligence processes . In the year under review , we audited all new sales partners . In addition , we use a permanent monitor-ing process to review all current sales partners with the aim of identifying possible conduct violations by sales partners . In the year under review , we also further developed our globally standardized and risk-based procedures for selecting and cooperating with suppliers , particularly in light of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . Further information can be found on the w/uni00A0Website for our suppliers and in the chapters E/uni00A0Green supply chain and E/uni00A0Human rights.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 71B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Internal information , communication and training measuresDaimler Truck o\ufb00ers a comprehensive range of training courses on compliance topics . Training needs are determined on a regular basis and adjustments as well as enhancements were carried out . The contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respec-tive target group . A web-based and target group-oriented training program is available for employees in administrative areas , consisting of a range of mandatory modules . Employees from production and production-related areas can voluntarily take part in the training program . The training modules are assigned when an employee is hired , promoted or transferred to a function that involves an increased risk . The web-based training measures are available worldwide via a Learning Management System ( \u201c LMS \u201d ) . We are supplementing our web-based training program with face-to-face training , some of which we conducted in digital form in 2022 . We also o\ufb00er information and quali\ufb01cation measures for supervisory and management functions . As part of an executive onboarding program , we are providing information on legal and compli-ance topics in order to assist newly appointed Supervisory Board members and members of the executive management of the Group companies in their new role .

Centrally available data and , if necessary , local information is accessed . References to non-e\ufb00ective implementation of measures are recorded as part of monitoring and measures are de\ufb01ned for this purpose . If required by changing risks or new legal require-ments , we adapt our processes and measures in the CMS.The monitoring results and other possible measures are evalu-ated and approved by the Compliance Board . The compliance risk and monitoring process is carried out at Daimler Truck for all speci\ufb01ed compliance \ufb01elds . Compliance \ufb01elds that are in the process of being set up are subject to an adequacy check . Moreover , compliance programs and processes along estab-lished areas are examined in regard to their e\ufb00ectiveness . /uni25B4In the reporting year , the described monitoring process and the annual adequacy and e\ufb00ectiveness review did not reveal any indications that the compliance program , processes or measures decided upon would not be appropriate or e\ufb00ective in the context of the company \u2019 s risk situation./uni25BE Furthermore , KPMG AG Wirtscha/ftspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/ft , Berlin , audited the CMS of the former Daimler AG for anti-cor-ruption , antitrust and technical compliance ( \u201c tCMS \u201d ) in accor-dance with Auditing Standard 980 of the German Institute of Public Auditors . The audits were geared to appropriateness , implementation and e\ufb00ectiveness , and were successfully com-pleted for the former Daimler AG , for CMS anti-corruption in 2019 , for tCMS with a focus on emissions relevance in 2020 , and for CMS antitrust in 2021 as a re-audit a/fter the initial audit in 2016 . In 2019 , the design of the Data CMS was also audited . Selected units of Daimler Truck AG also participated in the decentralized e\ufb00ectiveness audit.Risk and opportunity management /uni2004GRI 2-25/uni2004Risk and opportunity management is an integral part of the Group-wide planning , management and reporting process . It is intended to support the achievement of the Company \u2019 s goals in a sustainable manner and to raise awareness of risks in the Company . The ESG-related risks and opportunities that are linked to our own business activities , products , and services of Daimler Truck and that could very probably have serious nega-tive impact on the non-\ufb01nancial aspects with regard to the CSR Directive Implementation Act ( \u201c CSR-RUG \u201d ) can be found in the overall assessment of the risk and opportunity situation in the risk and opportunity report of the combined manage-ment report . There was no occurrence of serious non-\ufb01nancial risks in the year under review . Detailed information can be found in the E Risk and Opportunity Report . /uni25B4Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 73B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Tax obligations /uni2004GRI 207/uni2004Daimler Truck sees itself as a responsible company that strives to comply with its worldwide tax obligations . In this context , we want to live up to our corporate values and to our social and ethical responsibility . As part of the tax strategy of the Group , we pursue the follow-ing principles in particular , taking into account the economic and social impacts and in accordance with the corporate and business strategy : \u2013 Through our actions , we want to ensure that the tax obliga-tions of Group \u2019 s companies are met and integrity standards are maintained through measures such as e\ufb03cient , high-quality and reliable expertise , processes , systems , methods and controls.\u2013 We live an active risk management for the Group and its operational employees through an appropriate Tax Compli-ance Management System ( \u201c Tax CMS \u201c ) . \u2013 We pursue legal , active and non-aggressive tax planning based on economic grounds ( \u201c tax follows business \u201d ) . This means that we , as a company , comply with our responsibility as a taxpayer . We also strive to work cooperatively , transpar-ently , and constructively with the tax authorities . In the pro-cess , we maintain our legal standpoints and defend our interests wherever we believe such actions are appropriate and legitimate . The Group \u2019 s tax strategy de\ufb01nes the limits of our actions , and this strategy is further speci\ufb01ed and imple-mented by means of organizational and content-related policies , provisions , and instructions.The worldwide responsibility for tax is allocated to the Head of Tax of Daimler Truck . Signi\ufb01cant tax-relevant decisions are made in the Tax Compliance and Tax Risk Committee ( \u201c TCRC \u201d ) , which the Chief Financial O\ufb03cer is a member of . The TCRC is also kept informed on an ongoing basis about material tax issues . The tax policies regulate the responsibilities , tasks and duties of the persons entrusted with tax matters at Daimler Truck . In addition , they provide concrete implementation guidelines for meeting relevant legal obligations and enhance our employees \u2019 awareness of tax-related issues . In accordance with the Group \u2019 s Code of Conduct , intentional violations of external and/or internal tax requirements must be reported and fol-lowed up . The same applies to failure to correct incorrectly processed transactions.The Group-wide Tax CMS is a de\ufb01ned sub-area of our general CMS and is the responsibility of the Tax department . Tax risk management is also part of the Tax CMS . Its function is to monitor and check whether tax obligations are met . This risk management system , which is consistent across the Group , serves to identify and reduce tax risks within Daimler Truck and associated personal risks of the employees acting on behalf of the Group . It comprises numerous measures , such as ongoing monitoring or integration of tax risks in the internal control system and in the Group-wide risk management pro-cess in accordance with the risk management policy . In the year under review , we were not aware of any signi\ufb01cant viola-tions of tax laws that would have resulted in criminal proceed-ings.Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 74B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 101B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler TruckEnvironmental objective 4 - \u201c Transition to a circular economy \u201d \u2013 Activity 3.3 : The possibility of using secondary raw materials and the possibility of a design for easy disassembly and durability must be taken into account for the relevant vehi-cles . In addition , hazardous substances must be traceable and a waste management established at the sites . In this context , various Group-internal guidelines and standards apply as well as , in individual cases , further suitable evi-dence . The issue of durability is anchored , for example , in the product development process . The \u201c Group Standard for Waste Management \u201d de\ufb01nes waste management across the Group . \u2013 Activities 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.6 : The criterion requires the exis-tence of waste management measures , in particular at the end of a vehicle \u2019 s life cycle.\u2013 Activities 6.5 and 6.6 : De\ufb01ned quotas of recyclable or reus-able materials in the products must be complied with . If the quotas determined in accordance with the speci\ufb01cations reach the required threshold values , the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful\ufb01lled . Environmental objective 5 - \u201c Pollution prevention and control \u201d - Activity 3.3 : The criterion is based on Appendix C of the Del-egated Regulation ( EU ) 2021/2139 . Appendix C refers to var-ious European regulations out of the chemicals legislation . The de\ufb01ned substances are subject to restrictions on manu-facture , placing on the market and use , both in terms of use at the sites and in the products . There are di\ufb03culties in interpreting the vague legal term \u201c essential for society \u201d . \u2013 Activities 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.6 : Compliance with certain tire cate-gories in terms of rolling resistance and rolling noise shall be demonstrated . In the reporting year , appropriate analyses were performed for the relevant vehicles to provide the required evidence . If information on the tires is available and the corresponding classes are adhered to , the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful\ufb01lled . Environmental objective 6 - \u201c Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems \u201d - Activity 3.3 : The criterion refers to Appendix D of Delegated Regulation ( EU ) 2021/2139 , which de\ufb01nes requirements for the protection of biodiversity and biodiversity-sensitive areas in the vicinity of the sites . As part of the environmen-tal due diligence audits , compliance with environmental per-mits is veri\ufb01ed , among other aspects . The impact on nearby , sensitive areas is also examined . If required , measures are derived ( for details , see chapter E Preventing pollution ) .During the assessment , the relevant technical screening crite-ria were analyzed , interpreted , the results documented and substantiated by corresponding evidence documents and cal-culations.Minimum safeguards As part of the audit of compliance with the minimum safe-guards , the following topics were analyzed centrally : - Human rights , including labor rights ; - Corruption and bribery ; - Taxation ; \u2013 Fair competition.No increased risk was identi\ufb01ed and assessed in this regard for the 2022 reporting year . For each potential risk area , pre-ventive and , if necessary , remedial measures are already in place . As part of the due diligence processes , it was possible to demonstrate that there are no convictions in any of the four subject areas ( for details , see chapter E Social ) Reporting on the three performance indicatorsReporting on the KPIs required under the Taxonomy Regulation for turnover , CapEx and OpEx is shown in tables \uf0e4/uni00A0B.52 , \uf0e4/uni00A0B.53 and \uf0e4/uni00A0B.54 . All activities are fully assigned to the envi-ronmental objective of \u201c climate change mitigation \u201d . Further-more , all activities can be clearly assigned to the respective economic activity according to the Taxonomy Regulation . This avoids double counting in the calculation of the overall perfor-mance indicators .

Other texts , tables , cross-references and content of external websites are additional information which are not part of the non-\ufb01nancial statement of the Group and therefore have not been audited.Daimler Truck applies the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative ( \u201c GRI \u201d ) as a framework for external reporting . The contents of the non-\ufb01nancial Group statement in conjunction with further information that can be found in this report and on our website have been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards . /uni25B4The GRI content index can be found on our w/uni00A0Website .

For details , please refer to section E/uni00A0Materiality analysis . /uni25B4What has changed in this report ? /uni2004GRI 2-4/uni2004Qualitative information in the report relates primarily to the 2022 \ufb01nancial year , while the key \ufb01gures presented generally cover three years . The reporting date for the collection of quantitative data was December 31 , 2022 . Isolated deviations are marked in each case.During the reporting period , further organizational changes occurred due to the spin-o\ufb00 of Daimler Truck AG in Decem-ber 2021 from the former Daimler AG compared to the 2021 Report , so that comparability of the data with the previous Sustainability Report is only partially possible.We see more integrated reporting as another important mech-anism for further developing our sustainable business strategy . For this reason , we have decided to integrate aspects of sus-tainability into the Annual Report for the reporting year and have refrained from a separate sustainability report./uni25BE EU taxonomy Companies are obliged to apply the Taxonomy Regulation if they are required to prepare a non-\ufb01nancial statement in accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the EU Accounting Directive , implemented by Section 289b Subsection 1 and Sec-tion 315b Subsection 1 of the HGB . According to this , Daimler Truck has been obliged to apply the Taxonomy Regulation since the 2021 reporting year . Daimler Truck applied the reporting requirements in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation for the 2021 reporting year and exercised the relief provisions for the year of initial application , according to which only the tax-onomy eligibility had to be reported . For the 2022 reporting year , Daimler Truck is publishing the full disclosures in accor-dance with the Taxonomy Regulation for the \ufb01rst time . Thus , in addition to the proportions of taxonomy-eligible and non-eligi-ble economic activities , the proportions of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in turnover , investments ( \u201c CapEx \u201d ) and operating expenditure ( \u201c OpEx \u201d ) must also be disclosed . Production-related energy and environmental data/uni2004GRI 305-1/-2/-4/uni2004The data in the Environment section is based on the Group structure as of the reporting date of December 31 , 2022 . This includes all production sites and selected test tracks and R & D sites of the Group companies controlled by Daimler Truck as well as selected joint ventures with 50 % participation . Production sites include all \u201c Completely Built Up \u201d ( \u201c CBU \u201d ) , \u201c Completely Knocked Down \u201d ( \u201c CKD \u201d ) and Remanufacturing ( \u201c Reman \u201d ) sites . There has been no retroactive adjustment of the \ufb01gures for 2020 and 2021.The environmental data is collected from the sites in our envi-ronmental data system . If in individual cases no actual values are available in February , estimates are made on the basis of the previous year \u2019 s values and the change in production . Air emissions are measured regularly and extrapolated to the year , and VOC emissions are also calculated on the basis of various input or output parameters.Daimler Truck calculates and documents its CO2 emissions according to the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Stan-dard 2004 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative , in accor-dance with the categories Scope 1 and Scope 2 . Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are reported in accordance with the Con-trol approach of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.Documented are all direct CO2 emissions from our Company \u2019 s own sources ( Scope 1 ) , indirect emissions resulting from the generation of the purchased electricity and district heat ( Scope 2 ) .Scope 1 : We calculate our direct emissions from the combus- tion of fuels , heating oil , natural gas , lique\ufb01ed petroleum gas , and coal with \ufb01xed CO2 emission factors as speci\ufb01ed by the Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 127B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Sustainability at Daimler Truck Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 143B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportWarranty and goodwill cases could arise in the Daimler Truck Group if the quality of products does not meet the require-ments , regulations are not fully complied with , or support in the event of problems and product care can not be provided in the required form . Such warranty and goodwill cases as well as quality problems both with components in vehicles and in con-nection with technical innovations on vehicles that require adjustments can lead to \ufb01nancial burdens . Possible claims in connection with such risks are examined and , if necessary , appropriate measures are initiated for the a\ufb00ected products.Information technology risks and opportunitiesThe systematically pursued digitalization strategy opens up new opportunities for Daimler Truck and allows it to enhance customer bene\ufb01ts and the value of the Company . Neverthe-less , the high penetration level of information technology ( \u201c IT \u201d ) in all business areas also harbors risks for business and pro-duction processes as well as for their services and products.The ever-growing threat posed by cybercrime and the spread of aggressive malicious code give rise to risks that can a\ufb00ect the availability , integrity and con\ufb01dentiality of information and IT-supported operating resources . Despite extensive precau-tions , in the worst-case scenario , this can lead to a temporary interruption of IT-supported business processes with severe negative e\ufb00ects on the Group \u2019 s earnings . In addition , the loss or misuse of sensitive data may under certain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation . In particular , applicable regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Directive ( \u201c EU-GDPR \u201d ) may , among other things , give rise to claims by third parties and result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties with an impact on earnings.For the globally active Daimler Truck Group and its comprehen-sive business and production processes , it is of vital impor-tance that information is available , up-to-date , complete and correct and that it can be exchanged as needed . The Group \u2019 s internal IT security framework is based on international stan-dards and uses industrial standards and good practice as part of its protective measures . New regulatory requirements for cyber security and cyber security management systems are taken into account in the further development of our processes and policies.Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable IT infrastructure must be used to protect information . Cyber threats must be identi\ufb01ed over the entire lifecycle of applications and IT sys-tems , and dealt with in line with their criticality . Particular attention is paid to risks that could , at worst , result in an inter-ruption of business processes due to IT system failures and/or the loss and corruption of data . The advancing digitalization and connectivity of production equipment is supplemented by coordinated technical and organizational security measures.Due to growing demands concerning the con\ufb01dentiality , integ-rity and availability of data , Daimler Truck has implemented a wide range of preventive and corrective measures in order to minimize the associated risks and limit possible damage . For example , the Group reduces potential interruptions of operat-ing processes in data centers by means of mirrored data sets , decentralized data storage , outsourced data backups and IT systems designed for high availability . Emergency plans are developed and employees are trained and regularly sensitized in order to maintain operating capability . Speci\ufb01c threats are analyzed , and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active Cyber Security & Response Center . The protection of products and services against the danger of falling prey to hacker attacks and cybercrime is under constant development.Personnel risks and opportunitiesThe Daimler Truck Group is dependent on good relationships with its employees , their trade unions as well as employee representative bodies and stakeholders and is party to a number of collective agreements , some of which impose obli-gations and restrictions on the Daimler Truck Group in connec-tion with reorganizations , restructurings or similar corporate actions and which it may not be able to extend , renew or replace in a favorable or timely manner or at all . Any deteriora-tion of the relationships with trade unions , works councils and other employee representative bodies could adversely impact the Daimler Truck Group \u2019 s business operations . The Group could face strikes or other types of con\ufb02icts with trade unions , works councils or its employees in the future . Any such strikes , con\ufb02icts , work stoppages or other industrial actions may dis-rupt the Group \u2019 s production and sales activities , damage its reputation and adversely a\ufb00ect its customer relations . Annual Report 2022 | Daimler Truck 144B | Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Statement of the Group | Risk and Opportunity ReportCompetition for highly quali\ufb01ed employees and managers con-tinues to be very \ufb01erce in the industry and the regions in which Daimler Truck operates . The future success of the Daimler Truck Group also depends on the extent to which it succeeds in recruiting , integrating and retaining specialist sta\ufb00 . The established human resources instruments take such personnel risks into consideration . A particular focus of human resources management is the targeted personnel development and fur-ther training of the Company \u2019 s workforce . In order to remain successful as a company , we continuously develop the way we work together and optimize our management culture.Demographic developments are forcing the Group to deal with changes caused by an aging workforce and to secure a skilled new generation of specialists and future executives . Generation management addresses this by implementing mea-sures that do justice to the scope of the issue . We counter eco-nomic , market and competitive \ufb02uctuations with the estab-lished time and \ufb02exibility instruments , enabling reactions that are suitable for the respective situation . Efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial for the Group to maintain its competitiveness and improve its prof-itability . The Group is in the midst of implementing a number of operational performance and cost-saving initiatives to address \ufb01xed and variable costs a\ufb00ecting pro\ufb01tability . These opera-tional performance and cost-saving measures , or components thereof , may not deliver the intended bene\ufb01ts within the time the Group targets . This may result in implementation costs in excess of those originally budgeted by the Group and the actual results of the initiatives may di\ufb00er from the targets . If the targeted operational performance and cost-saving mea-sures are not fully realized or achieved within the intended time , this could have an adverse e\ufb00ect on the Group \u2019 s pro\ufb01t margins.Risks and opportunities related to associated companies and joint venturesCooperation with partners in associated companies and joint ventures is of vital importance for Daimler Truck , in the trans-formation towards both zero-emission mobility and compre-hensive digitalization . Particularly in the case of new technolo-gies , associated companies can help boost synergy e\ufb00ects and improve cost structures in order to successfully face the com-petition in the commercial vehicle industry.The Daimler Truck Group generally participates in the risks and opportunities of associated companies and joint ventures in line with its equity interest . It is also subject to share-price risks and opportunities if those companies are listed on the stock exchange.The remeasurement of an interest in an associated company can result in risks and opportunities related to the invest-ment \u2019 s carrying amount for the segment to which the associ-ated company belongs . Risks can also arise from ongoing busi-ness activities , especially through the integration of employees , technologies and products . The Group \u2019 s business and legal interests may not always be aligned with those of its associated companies and joint ventures and any of the Group \u2019 s current or future associated companies or joint ven-tures may fail to be successful , achieve their planned objec-tives and meet their targeted timelines . In addition , further \ufb01nancial obligations or additional \ufb01nancing requirements could arise . Associated companies are subject to a monitoring pro-cess so that , if necessary , decisions can be promptly made on whether or not measures should be taken to support or secure pro\ufb01tability .

In addition , any violation can lead to negative media coverage and a\ufb00ect the Group \u2019 s reputa-tion . Risks from legal proceedingsThe subsidiaries of Daimler Truck Holding AG ( especially Daimler Truck AG ) are confronted with various legal proceed-ings , claims as well as governmental investigations and orders ( legal proceedings ) on a large number of topics . These include , for example , vehicle conformity and vehicle safety , dealer , sup-plier and other contractual relationships , \ufb01nancial services , industrial property rights ( in particular patent infringement suits ) , warranty claims , and antitrust proceedings ( including claims for damages ) . If the outcome of such legal proceedings is negative for the Daimler Truck Group or such proceedings are settled , the Group may be required to pay substantial com-pensatory and punitive damages or to undertake service actions , recall campaigns , monetary penalties or other costly actions . Legal proceedings and related settlements may have an impact on the Group \u2019 s reputation.Antitrust law proceedings ( including actions for damages ) Mercedes-Benz Group AG , under the former name Daimler AG the former parent entity of Daimler Truck AG , was subject to an antitrust proceeding initiated by the European Commission . In July 2016 , the European Commission issued a settlement decision against the former Daimler AG and four other Euro-pean truck manufacturers for their participation in anti-com-petitive behavior in violation of European antitrust rules with regard to pricing and passing on the costs of compliance with strict emission rules for trucks . The European Commission found that Daimler AG participated in the relevant arrange-ments from January 17 , 1997 to January 18 , 2011 . The individual \ufb01ne imposed on Daimler AG by the European Commission \u2019 s settlement decision amounted to \u20ac1.09 billion and was fully paid in 2016.Following the settlement decision by the European Commis-sion , legal actions , class actions and other forms of legal redress for damages by direct and indirect truck customers have been \ufb01led or initiated in several jurisdictions . Damage claims could result in substantial liabilities for the Daimler Truck Group as well as signi\ufb01cant costs expended for defense measures , which may have a material adverse e\ufb00ect on the Daimler Truck Group \u2019 s operations and its liquidity and capital resources.In relation to the cartel infringement described above , most substantial claims ( including certain types of class actions or aggregator claims ) are pending or have been initiated in Ger-many , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and Spain . Claims are also pending in certain other European countries and in Israel ( in a total of approximately 20 countries ) .The Daimler Truck Group takes appropriate legal remedies to defend itself.It can not be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks from legal proceedings discussed above , individually or in the aggre-gate , may materially adversely impact the pro\ufb01tability , liquidity and capital resources and \ufb01nancial position of the Group or any of its segments.As legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of uncer-tainty , it is possible that a/fter their \ufb01nal resolution , some of the provisions that have been recognized for them could prove to be insu\ufb03cient . As a result , substantial additional expenditures may arise . This also applies to legal proceedings for which the Group has seen no requirement to recognize a provision.Although the \ufb01nal result of any such litigation may in\ufb02uence the Group \u2019 s earnings and cash \ufb02ows in any particular period , the Group believes that any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sustained e\ufb00ect on the Group \u2019 s \ufb01nancial position.Further information on legal proceedings is provided in E/uni00A0Note 31 of the Consolidated Financial Statements ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

The bank is guided by international standards and guidelines, such as:\n\u2013 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (*)\n\u2013 International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (*)\nincluding the International Labor Organization Core Labor Standards (*)\n\u2013 UN Global Compact (*)\n\u2013 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (*)\nThe core principle of the bank\u2019s approach is to not engage in business activities where Deutsche Bank has substantiated\nevidence of material adverse human rights impacts and it is determined through Deutsche Bank\u2019s internal processes that such\nadverse human rights impacts cannot be avoided or appropriately mitigated.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Statement on Human Rights (*) describes its commitment and management approach in greater detail. The\nbank worked on a review of the Statement, which was published in March 2023, also to reflect the increased public and\nregulatory focus on the topic, including in context of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, effective from January 2023.\nThe bank\u2019s approach encompasses all dimensions of its business, from client transactions and interactions with vendors and\nservice providers to the treatment of its employees. Deutsche Bank assesses its sectoral and geographical risk exposure to\nhuman rights violations regularly and undertakes due diligence to identify and assess the nature of the actual and potential\nadverse human rights impacts with which it may be directly or indirectly linked. Deutsche Bank also annually publishes a\nModern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement (*).\nThe following subchapters address the bank\u2019s human rights governance structure and the governance and mitigation\nmeasures, it has undertaken for the different stakeholder groups, particularly for clients, suppliers, and employees.\nGovernance\nGRI 2-12/13/16/25/26, 3-3\nIn 2022, building on the former Human Rights Working Group, the Human Rights Forum was established to ensure oversight\nof Deutsche Bank\u2019s human rights management. This Forum consists of senior representatives of the following functions and\nbusiness divisions: Procurement, Anti-Financial Crime, Chief Sustainability Office, Human Resources, Legal, Non-Financial\nRisk Management, Governance as well as Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, and Private Bank. DWS is involved ad hoc as\nappropriate. The Human Rights Forum is co-chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and the Head of Group Sustainability\nand reports to the Sustainability Committee.\nVia the Human Rights Forum, which meets bimonthly, the members monitor trends, collect and share learnings from within\nDeutsche Bank, liaise with external experts and initiate strategic projects relevant for human rights management.\nIn 2022, the Human Rights Forum served as an interface for both strategic and operational actions related to Human Rights.\nAs a specific activity within the Forum, the members evaluated the implications of the draft EU Corporate Sustainability Due\nDiligence Directive. In addition, the Forum supported the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\nwhich came into force in January 2023. The members of the Human Rights Forum also engaged in preparing the\naforementioned Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement (*) as well as the updated Human Rights Statement (*) for\npublication. The updated human rights governance was presented to the Supervisory Board; and the revised Statement on\nHuman Rights and the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement have been signed off by the Management Board.\n57 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nAlongside the Human Rights Forum, the above-named functions established working groups to address function specific\nhuman rights issues, e.g., the Anti-Financial Crime human rights working group which is dedicated to combatting modern\nslavery and human trafficking in the clients\u2019 business and on which further details are available below in the \u201cClients\u201d section\nof this chapter.\nMeeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened\nits procurement related human rights management processes. Further details can be found in the \u201cSupply chain\u201d section of\nthis chapter.\nDeutsche Bank has processes and channels in place to evaluate the effectiveness of its management approach to human\nrights. The bank draws on insights from the integrity hotline to assess whether the management approach with regard to\nemployees is effective or in need of further refinement. The bank evaluates effectiveness with regard to clients using a range\nof sources including transaction reviews for clients, in-house research, media reports, dialog with individual clients, and\nexchange on general trends and developments with peers. The approach to vendors is similar, consisting of information from\nthe vendor screening process supplemented by in-house research, media reports, and discussions with peers. Further details\non the bank\u2019s stakeholder engagement may be found in the chapter \u201cStakeholder engagement and thought leadership\u201d.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s human rights governance benefits from the exchange of ideas and experiences afforded by its membership\nin the Thun Group of Banks, which Deutsche Bank joined in 2012. In 2022, the bank continued to participate in the Thun\nGroup\u2019s meetings and activities relating to human rights in banking and, in particular, the United Nations Guiding Principles\non Business and Human Rights.\nKey topics in 2022\nClients\nGRI 2-23/24/25/29, 3-3, 404-2, FS1, FS3, FS4, FS5\nHuman rights due diligence is integral to Deutsche Bank\u2019s Environmental and Social Policy Framework. In order to identify,\nprevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, the bank has integrated human rights considerations in the environmental\nand social due diligence process, e.g., land rights and cultural heritage, labor and child rights, health and safety of workers\nand communities, and the rights of indigenous people. The chapter entitled \u201cEnvironmental and social due diligence\u201d, including\nthe table \u201cMain positions and minimum standards of environmental and social due diligence\u201d therein, contains more\ninformation on the related process and the principles Deutsche Bank applies.\nWhile human rights due diligence is a cross-sectoral issue, some sectors and activities have an inherently higher risk of\nnegatively impacting human rights. Thus, the Environmental and Social Policy Framework includes specific human rights-\nrelated expectations and requirements that apply to the sectors in scope of the Framework. Special attention will be paid to\ncases involving resettlement; cases where the bank identifies potential negative impacts on indigenous peoples; and cases\nwhere clients use security forces for site protection.\nIf Deutsche Bank has concerns about a client with regards to human rights, it consults with relevant stakeholders. This might\ninclude direct engagement with the client as well as with civil society representatives that are familiar with the situation. Where\nappropriate, the bank obtains the advice of independent experts. Based on all available information and its assessment of the\nrisks that have been identified, the bank decides on the further course of action, which may include termination of a business\nrelationship.\nThe implementation of the Equator Principles (*), which the bank officially adopted in 2020, further underscores its human\nrights risk assessments for eligible projects and its commitment to human rights preservation for transactions outside the\nscope of the Equator Principles. In 2022, the bank continued to conduct comprehensive trainings to ensure that relevant\nbusiness areas have an in-depth understanding of the Equator Principles as well as the requirements for assessing the impacts\non potential rights holders in the various projects that it finances.\nThe bank-wide framework for the prevention of Financial Crime contributes to preventing, deterring and detecting client\nactivities that might be linked to potential human rights violations. Being a global financial institution that provides a broad\nrange of products and services exposes Deutsche Bank to diverse financial crime risks, including modern slavery and human\ntrafficking. The Principles for the Management of Financial Crime Risks outline the responsibilities and accountabilities of the\nAnti-Financial Crime Function and of all employees at Deutsche Bank Group and describe the essential organizational\nrequirements and relevant processes for the management of financial crime risks across the 1st and 2nd Line of Defense\n(\u2018LoD\u2019). Global Anti-Financial Crime policies define minimum standards for managing financial crime risks, including those with\nimplications for human rights. These bank-wide polices are supplemented by country-specific policies and procedures that\nreflect national laws and regulations.\n58 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nThe Anti-Financial Crime human rights working group, which is part of the above-described bank-wide Human Rights Forum,\nwas established in 2021 to develop and pursue concrete measures and initiatives within the Anti-Financial Crime function to\nfight modern slavery and human trafficking. As a practical example of the progress made in 2022, modern slavery and human\ntrafficking related key risk drivers were incorporated within Deutsche Bank\u2019s Non-Financial Risk Taxonomy. This is going to\nfurther support the enhancement of Deutsche Bank\u2019s control framework.\nIndependent of the working group the Anti-Financial Crime department pro-actively contributed to initiatives within several\nPublic Private Partnerships. Deutsche Bank is currently leading the workstream \u201cFinancial Flows of Human Trafficking\u201d within\nthe German Public Privat Partnership Anti-Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA) and is part of a taskforce covering among other\ntopics human trafficking in the Europol Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP). In October 2022 the bank\nhosted an event organized by the Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking (FAST) initiative.\nTo reinforce employees\u2019 awareness of activities linked to potential human rights violations the bank conducts periodic trainings.\nOne specific example is a 45-minute mandatory online course on anti-money laundering (AML) and the prevention of terrorist\nand proliferation financing - topics that have potential connections to human rights violation. Every Deutsche Bank employee\nworldwide must complete the module once every year. Around 99% of staff (including in-scope contingent workers) did so in\n2022.\nMandatory Risk Awareness training is also deployed to all staff every other year. This online training now includes a specific\ncase on modern slavery in the private banking business and includes a question for learners on typical risk indicators. This\nupdated course was launched in the fourth quarter of 2022 to English speaking staff and is going to be rolled out as translated\nversions in non-English speaking locations at the beginning of the second quarter 2023.\nSupply chain\nGRI 2-6/25, 3-3\nThe products and services that Deutsche Bank buys, who it buys from, and how it consumes has a significant influence on its\nsustainability footprint. For this reason, sourcing and procurement activities play a key role in the bank\u2019s ambitions to respect\nand improve human rights.\nWhile the divisions are accountable for the suppliers they use, the Global Procurement function leads on the vast majority of\nsourcing and procurement decisions. In support of this, globally consistent processes and procedures are in place to govern\nthe sourcing and procurement of goods and services, onboarding of suppliers and the ongoing management of supplier\nperformance. Suppliers are required to meet a range of requirements including financial health, anti-fraud and corruption, and\ncompliance checks to engage with Deutsche Bank.\nSupplier Code of Conduct\nThe intention of the Supplier Code of Conduct (\u201cCode\u201d) is that suppliers understand the core values and standards of behavior\nthat Deutsche Bank expects its suppliers to conform to when providing goods and services. The Code is acknowledged by\nthe supplier responding to a request for proposal and on starting an engagement with Deutsche Bank, suppliers are expected\nto provide a copy of this Code to its personnel who will be involved in the supply of the goods and services.\nThe Code contains sections on Compliance with Law, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Sustainability, and Corporate\nSocial Responsibility. The Code is available on Deutsche Bank\u2019s public supplier portal (*).\nScreening of the bank\u2019s vendors for adequate social and environmental standards\nThe bank undertakes the assessment of prospective vendors\u2019 environmental and social standards starting with a questionnaire\nanalyzing the significance of potential social or environmental impacts related to a vendor\u2019s service delivery. Conditional on\nthe results of this analysis, the vendor risk management process may further scrutinize the potential for sustainability risks.\nFor vendors, with which Deutsche Bank spend more than \u20ac 500,000 annually vendor balanced scorecards were launched.\nThese scorecards evaluate vendors across a holistic set of key performance indicators. This evaluation includes a\nsustainability performance indicator which is either the rating score provided by EcoVadis or the vendor can use an equivalent\nreputable sustainability rating agency. From July 2022, the prerequisite for every new or prolonged contract worth more than\n\u20ac 500,000 a year is that the vendor has an external sustainability rating from EcoVadis or other rating agencies (*). To that\nend, the bank maintains a registration website (*) where vendors can obtain relevant information and start their assessments\nwith the sustainability rating agency, EcoVadis.\n59 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nMeeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened\nits procurement related human rights management processes. Based on a respective risk analysis, the bank adopted a risk\nmanagement system targeted at minimizing human rights adverse impacts across its supply chain. In addition to the above\nrequirements with regards to the submission of an external ESG rating, the bank enhanced preventive measures, including\nvendor due diligence, contract clauses according to vendors\u2019 risk profile and standardized processes for remedial action in\ncase of actual human rights incidents in the bank\u2019s supply chain. The process for remedial actions is triggered by a variety of\nobservations: incidents being flagged in Deutsche Bank\u2019s risk review cycles, reported incidents through internal and external\ncomplaints channels, incidents being identified in adverse media monitoring and allegations directly reported to Deutsche\nBank, e.g., by NGOs or media. In such cases, the incidents will be further investigated and appropriate measures to remedy\nthe adverse effects will be agreed with the vendor and monitored over time. The brand DWS is not covered by the management\napproach related to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act described in this section.\nEmployees\nGRI 3-3, FS4\nDeutsche Bank aims to be an \u2018employer of choice\u2019 for existing and future employees. The bank strives to create a workplace\nthat is both diverse and supportive and which is always welcoming of different views. The bank encourages high standards of\nconduct and work performance and is committed to providing a working environment free from harassment, discrimination\nand retaliation.\nGiven the activities it undertakes and the geographies in which it operates, Deutsche Bank\u2019s own operations have only limited\nexposure to adverse impacts from human rights violations. The bank aims to continue to monitor the safeguarding of human\nrights using a risk-based approach and focusing on those geographies where human rights issues are most likely to occur\nand where the bank has a material presence.\nDeutsche Bank is guided by the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\nas well as applicable labor laws in the different jurisdictions in which it operates. This includes sovereign state legislation on\ncollective agreements, bargaining and freedom of association. In countries where internationally recognized standards may\nnot be fully implemented, the bank aims to honor the principles of internationally recognized human rights.\nThe bank expects all employees to understand their responsibilities and to act in accordance with its policies, procedures, and\ninitiatives regarding human rights. The bank reinforces this awareness through bank-wide training. For example, 86.8% of\nemployees completed trainings on compliance and ethics that also include aspects of human rights in 2022 (2021 excluding\nPostbank: 93.3%). The bank investigated all employee grievances reported to the integrity hotline in 2022. If violations were\nidentified, they were reported to the appropriate functions, and the necessary steps were taken.\n60 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Public policy and regulation\nPublic policy and regulation\n\u2013 Continuing political dialogue\n\u2013 Clear rules for engagement with politicians and regulators\n\u2013 Sustainable finance, Basel III and digitalization of particular importance\nGRI 3-3\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive, complex, and frequently reviewed policies and regulations. This exposes the\nbank to significant regulatory risks. Deutsche Bank systematically prioritizes these risks and assigns clear accountability for\nidentifying regulatory changes, assessing their impact, and taking the steps necessary to ensure compliance.\nGovernance\nGRI 2-13, 3-3, FS3\nDeutsche Bank has a clearly structured framework for managing the risk of regulatory change and enhancing its profile in\npolicy and regulatory debates. The framework enables Deutsche Bank to engage with relevant regulatory and political\nstakeholders. It also ensures informed strategic decision-making and provides oversight and control over how key regulatory\ninitiatives are implemented. Amid greater regulatory activity worldwide, advocacy has become even more important for the\nbank.\nThe Political Affairs function is responsible for conducting transparent and constructive government and regulatory advocacy\non behalf of the bank. The function\u2019s aim is for this advocacy to support not only the bank but also the governments and\nregulators, as well as all Deutsche Bank\u2019s stakeholders: employees, clients, investors, and the countries where the bank\noperates. The Political Affairs function also monitors emerging policymaking and regulatory developments that may impact\nthe bank and develops and coordinates the bank\u2019s position on them. In addition, it advises senior management and clients on\nglobal political trends and geopolitical risk. Effective September 2022, this function is assigned from the Chief Executive Officer\nto the Global Head of Corporate Affairs & Strategy, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer. All other responsibilities and\nsetup did not change.\nThe global Political Affairs team is led by the Global Head of Political Affairs, who reports directly to the Global Head of\nCorporate Affairs & Strategy. The team consists of around 20 employees (Full Time Equivalent, FTE) in key business and\npolitical hubs: Frankfurt, London, New York, Berlin, Brussels, and Washington.\nThe Political Affairs function works closely with the Regulatory Affairs function. The latter is the principal point of contact for\nkey supervisors and is responsible for managing the bank\u2019s relationships and collaboration with them. It also supports senior\nmanagement\u2019s interactions with these supervisors. The Regulatory Affairs function provides insights into emerging supervisory\npriorities so that the bank can respond swiftly and appropriately, and ensures continual focus on ongoing matters, such as\nonsite visits as well as findings and commitments. The function is led by the Global Head of Regulatory Affairs, who reports\ndirectly to the Chief Administrative Officer.\nEmployee-stakeholder interaction\nGRI 2-12/23, FS1\nDeutsche Bank sets clear rules and procedures for interactions between employees and policy and regulatory stakeholders.\nThe Supervisory Authorities Engagement Policy governs interactions with core regulators in the United States, Europe, Hong\nKong, and Singapore. It requires all such interactions to be logged and minuted by the relevant Regulatory Management\nGroup. In addition, interactions with the German Federal Government and the German Parliament as well as with the EU\ninstitutions must comply with the bank\u2019s policy on Representation of Interests. This policy sets the standards for interactions\nwith representatives of the German Federal Government and the German Parliament as well as of the EU institutions. It\nprovides a centralized clearance of the contacts with representatives of these institutions in so far, they are carried out with\nthe aim of directly or indirectly influencing the decision-making process and especially the formulation or implementation of\npolicy or legislation. Deutsche Bank also has policies regarding its U.S. lobbying activities and employees\u2019 political\ncontributions to Deutsche Bank Americas\u2019 Political Action Committee (for more information, see \u201cGroup policy does not permit\ndonations to political parties\u201d below).\n81 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Public policy and regulation\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank has a global policy in place to ensure that its communications with supervisory authorities are\nconsistent. Regarding engagements in political dialogue, all employees must adhere to the bank\u2019s global Anti-Bribery and\nCorruption Policy. This policy lays out rules for the offering and acceptance of gifts by Deutsche Bank employees, employees\u2019\nparticipation in events organized by third parties, and the associated record keeping.\nFinancial transparency\nGRI 415-1\nThe bank is a signatory to the EU Transparency Register (*), which requires it to comply with the register\u2019s code of conduct\nand to disclose an estimation of expenditures for advocacy toward EU institutions. In 2022, the bank had three employees\n(full time equivalent) focused on political engagement in the EU. Annual estimated costs related to activities covered by the\nRegister were \u20ac 1,750,000 to \u20ac 1,999,999. These costs consisted of, among other things, expenses for the bank\u2018s Brussels\noffices, including staff there as well as staff outside of Brussels and a percentage of membership fees in associations active\nat the EU level.\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank is a signatory to the Federal German Lobbying Register, which requires to comply with a code of\nconduct and to disclose, among others, an estimation of expenditures for advocacy toward the Federal German Government\nand German Parliament. Annual estimated costs, based on the provision of law and related to activities covered by the\nRegister, were \u20ac 3,570,001 to \u20ac 3,580,000. In addition, Deutsche Bank is also reported in the respective Lobbying Registers\nin the States of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Those registers improve the transparency of Deutsche Bank\u2019s political\nengagement in Germany.\nGroup policy does not permit donations to political parties\nGRI 2-23, FS1\nPursuant to the bank\u2019s Group Policy on Donations, Memberships & Sponsorships, the Group does not permit direct or indirect\ndonations to political parties. The bank\u2019s Anti-Bribery and Corruption function must pre-approve donations to organizations\naffiliated with political parties or activities relating to governments and/or political parties.\nEmployees who are U.S. Citizens or green card holders living in the United States may make voluntary donations to the\nDeutsche Bank Americas\u2019 Political Action Committee (PAC). The PAC is regulated by the U.S. Federal Election Commission;\nthe PAC makes monthly public filings to the Federal Election Commission as required by law. Corporate contributions to\nfederal elections are prohibited. U.S. law therefore prohibits contributions by the bank to the PAC, although the bank may pay\nthe PAC\u2019s administrative costs.\nMemberships in trade associations\nGRI 2-28, 415-1\nDeutsche Bank is a member of a number of trade associations globally. Deutsche Bank engages with trade associations and\nbrings in inhouse experts into their relevant working groups, supports their work on consultation processes and filters back\nfeedback on their positions where Deutsche Bank considers this relevant or can leverage inhouse expertise. The Chief\nExecutive Officer Christian Sewing is president of the Associations of German Banks (Bundesverband deutscher Banken,\nBdB) and designated president of the European Banking Federation (EBF \u2013 starting March 2023), he has highlighted the\nrelevance of the banking sector to shape the transformation to a digital and sustainable economy.\n82 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nAnti-financial crime\n\u2013 Preventing, deterring, detecting and reporting financial crime\n\u2013 Maintaining a regular dialogue with supervisory control functions\n\u2013 Continuing to increase investments in financial crime controls\nVision and mission\nGRI 2-12/23/24, 3-3\nFinancial crime has a detrimental impact on society and can have severe consequences for individuals. Organized crime\nengages in fraud, bribery, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing as well as human, drug and arms trafficking. The\noutcome harms individuals, institutions, and the integrity of the financial system.\nCriminals use complex schemes including targeted placement and layering across different borders in their attempt to integrate\nthe proceeds of their crimes back into the global financial system.\nDeutsche Bank is targeted directly by criminal organizations who want to exploit the bank\u2019s global financial products and\nservices to support their illegal activities. Effective anti-financial crime controls are critical components of Deutsche Bank\u2019s\nstrategy to prevent, detect, and report these illegal activities. This includes in-depth knowledge about Deutsche Bank\u2019s\ncustomers, their source of funds, and their source of wealth. If criminals find a way around these control measures, individuals\nor institutions can be harmed and Deutsche Bank can suffer reputational damage as well as severe financial penalties.\nFighting financial crime is an integral part of the bank\u2019s business activities and continuous improvements to the Group\u2019s\ncapabilities in fighting financial crime are a critical priority. The Management Board, and all employees, are required to adhere\nto the highest standards of conduct to fight financial crime. Every employee is responsible for the management of financial\ncrime risk. This includes: (i) The prevention of financial crime by observing obligations, policies and procedures. All financial\ncrime risk policies are available in a dedicated policy portal, reviewed annually and changes are communicated to all\nemployees. Familiarity is reinforced through mandatory training and failure to comply can lead to disciplinary action. (ii) The\ndetection of unusual or suspicious behavior or patterns including the use of transaction monitoring systems which generate\nalerts that are reviewed by dedicated and trained teams of employees and (iii) The reporting of customers, third parties and/or\ntransactions that appear unusual.\nGovernance\n\nThe ultimate decision and authority regarding financial crime risks lies with the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer, who is,\nat the same time, the Head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Anti-Financial Crime function (AFC) and reports to the Chief Administration\nOfficer. The Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer is a delegated authority from the Management Board authorized to establish\na financial crime risk management framework and take any measures necessary to manage financial crime risks appropriately\nand in consideration of applicable legal requirements. AFC acts as an independent function, setting policies and standards for\nthe management and mitigation of financial crime risks at Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank\u2019s business divisions are responsible\nand accountable for the implementation and operationalization of these policies and standards. The Management Board\nensures that AFC can execute its tasks independently and effectively.\nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank is informed about the status of financial crime risk management on a regular basis\nby the Management Board and the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer according to German law. For example, the Group\nAnti-Money Laundering Officer and the responsible Management Board member provided quarterly updates to the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\nThe Supervisory Board and Management Board execute strong engagement and tone from the top with focus on compliance\nand financial crime risk matters in key committees. The Supervisory Board is well staffed and equipped to oversee the bank\u2019s\nefforts in this regard. Since 2020, the Supervisory Board has set-up a dedicated Financial Crime Risk Working Group to\nconduct additional monitoring and to provide holistic advice to the Management Board for the purpose of remedying\nshortcomings in the Anti-Money Laundering function. In 2022, the Regulatory Oversight Committee has been established,\nwhich is mandated to provide central oversight across regulatory engagement and remediation across the bank.\n85 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nKey topics in 2022\nGRI 3-3\nResources and transformation execution\nThere are dedicated employees within AFC, the business divisions, and Deutsche Bank\u2019s technology function whose main\ntask is to manage financial crime risks. In 2022, AFC initiated a hiring strategy to strengthen execution and leadership\ncapabilities, which led to a substantial increase of AFC\u2019s headcount. The AFC leadership team was enhanced with a number\nof senior hires including heads for the regions Americas, United Kingdom and Ireland, and a Head of Financial Crime Data &\nRisk Intelligence. At year end 2022, AFC had 1,932 employees (Full Time Equivalent, FTE), which is an increase of 343 FTE\nas compared to 2021. At year end 2022, AFC was also supported by 192 contingent workers.\nBeyond hiring, Deutsche Bank continued to execute core change initiatives focused on remediating internally and externally\nidentified issues and proactively enhancing controls for financial crime risks. The oversight of the central financial crime risk\nremediation program now falls under the additional oversight of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Transformation Office for consistency\nand to support the integration across remediation plans. This central program is expected to move Deutsche Bank into a\nsustainable environment, including robust Know Your Client (KYC) checks by business divisions for client adoption, ongoing\nmonitoring by control functions, dynamic risk assessments, risk appetite matching and independent audits by a specialized\naudit team.\nPartnerships\nThe fight against financial crime requires an exchange of knowledge and experiences to improve and further develop an\neffective management of financial crime risks. In 2022, Deutsche Bank deepened its existing industry engagements by\nstrengthening its ties with its associations, such as the Wolfsberg Group of Banks, but also its involvement in public private\npartnerships (collaborations between the public and private sector), such as (1) the German Anti Financial Crime Alliance\n(AFCA) which is composed of representatives from both the financial and non-financial sector, as well as the public authorities\nincluding Germany\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr\nFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA) and where\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Management Board member Stefan Simon became part of the AFCA Board; (2) Europol\u2019s Financial\nIntelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP) where the deputy Head of AFC became part of EFIPPP\u2019s Steering Group\nand (3) the UK Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank and Visa announced a\ncollaboration on the prevention of online retail frauds with an automated fraud detection system, Cybersource, owned by Visa.\nRussian sanctions\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against Russian state entities, companies and\nindividuals linked to Russia. Deutsche Bank manages these sanctions with enhanced communications, guidance, and\noperational support led by AFC\u2019s Sanctions & Embargoes team.\nOrders and fines related to financial crime risk\nOn September 28, 2022, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank AG to take specific measures aimed at preventing money laundering\nand terrorist financing in order to implement the orders that BaFin issued on September 21, 2018, and February 15, 2019.\nIn July 2022 the bank accepted a fine of \u20ac 7 million for the administrative offence of delayed filing of two Suspicious Activity\nReports (SAR) in a historic matter thereby ending the Frankfurt public prosecutor\u2019s investigation into this matter, in relation to\nwhich a search took place at Deutsche Bank\u2019s headquarters on April 29, 2022.\nRisk exposure and controls\nGRI 2-23/24/25/26, 3-3, 205-1/2/3, FS1, FS3\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s inherent exposure to financial crime risks is influenced by its clients\u2019 footprint and transaction behavior, the\ngeographies in which it operates, the products and services offered, and the sales channels used. The exposure to various\nfinancial crime risks is subsumed under money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions and embargoes, internal and external\nfraud and bribery and corruption.\n86 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing are significant risks to Deutsche Bank, e.g., in the Corporate Bank which provides\nbanking facilities to correspondent banks and their customers. To control these risks, minimum control standards are defined\nincluding, among others, risk-based client due diligence, the monitoring of transactions, name list screening, investigation of\nalerts and the filing of suspicious activity reports to authorities. These Suspicious Activity Reports can be triggered by alerts\nfrom Transaction Monitoring, internal referrals from employees, enquiries of law enforcement or referrals from other banks.\nFurther measures include assessing the risk exposure in the client population and reducing the exposure through, for example,\nterminating relevant client relationships and liquidating or reducing risk in relevant and associated positions. The Anti-Money\nLaundering Policy contains the minimum control requirements and is updated regularly in line with regulatory developments\nand supplemented with internal safeguarding measures.\nSanctions and embargos\nDeutsche Bank is committed to complying with sanctions imposed by the United Nations, European Union, and Germany\nglobally as well as sanctions applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates, especially the United States and United\nKingdom. To control this risk, transactions are filtered, client and counterparty data is screened, trade in sanctioned financial\ninstruments is restricted, and further measures such as rejecting or freezing a transaction, restricting client activities, or exiting\na client relationship are taken. The Sanctions Policy \u2013 Deutsche Bank Group sets out the requirements and standards that\napply globally within the bank.\nAnti-fraud, bribery and corruption\nDeutsche Bank has no tolerance for its employees, or third parties acting on its behalf, to engage in bribery or corruption and\nis committed to compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. On an annual basis\nthe Bank undertakes an assessment of inherent bribery and corruption risks and corresponding controls across all of its\nbusinesses. All Bank employees, including board members, are required to complete mandatory online anti-bribery and\ncorruption training. Employees who do not complete their training are subject to potential disciplinary action. The bank has\npolicies, procedures, and controls to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption across key risk areas such as gifts and\nentertainment, hiring practices, use of third-party intermediaries, and participation in joint ventures as well as in strategic\ninvestments. These controls include the escalation of approvals, enhanced due diligence, contractual limitations, and ongoing\nmonitoring to identify behaviors that could be indicative of bribery and corruption. As with all AFC policies, changes to the anti-\ncorruption policies are communicated to all employees. The Bank has continued to reduce its exposure to areas that present\na higher inherent risk of bribery and corruption, such as use of Business Development Consultants. Finally, potential instances\nof bribery or corruption would be investigated, and any employee determined to be engaged in such behavior would be subject\nto disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\nThe Bank has implemented a holistic Fraud Risk Management Framework across all Lines of Defense, defining governance\nand minimum standards, and establishing key controls to mitigate the risk of fraud, such as Mandatory Time Away and Fraud\nTransaction Monitoring.\nTargets and measures\nGRI 2-24/26, 3-3, 205-2, 404-2, FS4\nAt Deutsche Bank, AFC defines the uniform strategy for the prevention of financial crime, including the preparation of group-\nwide policies and overseeing the implementation. The accountability for the definition and regular review of the risks controlled\nby AFC lies with the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer. In order to be able to understand the required measures, it is\nimportant to capture, identify and weigh the financial crime risk Deutsche Bank is faced with. AFC regularly conducts an\nanalysis of the financial crime risks and prepares a risk assessment for Deutsche Bank Group, as well as relevant subsidiaries\nto the extent required by applicable legal requirements. The risk analysis is reviewed annually and approved by the responsible\nManagement Board member. Changes within the organization, but also the offering of new products can have an impact on\nthe bank\u2019s risk exposure.\nAFC is involved in structural divisional changes such as new products, new lines of business, expansions to new countries or\nnew client categories to ensure the changes are within the Bank\u2019s risk appetite and that effective risk assessment, monitoring\nand controls are defined before their launch. In order to adjust the strategy in a timely way to an ever-changing legal\nenvironment, AFC monitors requirements and advises and supports the Management Board and employees in the business\ndivisions on changed requirements and their implementation into relevant policies.\n87 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s most critical asset against financial crime risks are its employees. Deutsche Bank promotes a risk culture\nthat encourages employees to speak-up and a thorough awareness for financial crime risks. Deutsche Bank has carefully\nnurtured a culture of compliance and integrity in the bank, including the fight against financial crime. Tone from the top is\nextremely important and senior management is highly committed to drive cultural change through behavioral changes and\nreinforcing the change. Culture initiatives are driven both on group and divisional level across Deutsche Bank and a culture\nreview framework is in place to identify areas that may be exhibiting poor culture to act through targeted culture reviews.\nSpecial focus is put on speak-up, which is subject of wide-ranging training efforts and communication campaigns.\nRegular (at least annual) training for all employees is conducted covering all financial crime risks and testing their policy\nknowledge. There is a mandatory curriculum accompanied by other additional facultative training offerings. The training\nmodules highlight the importance of identifying financial crime risks and raising concerns or suspicions including the use of\nthe anonymous whistle-blower hotline. Modules articulate personal, professional, financial, regulatory, and societal\nconsequences of failing to manage financial crime risks. A completion rate of 99,96% has been achieved for the learners\nrequired to complete the mandatory anti-financial crime training by year end 2022. Learners who have not completed the\ntraining within the final due date are reported to the Compliance red flag team for investigation and may receive a red flag, if\neligible. Management Board members receive ongoing periodic online training about financial crime topics as well as in-person\ntailored training and briefings on topics such as the risks of cryptocurrency.\nDeutsche Bank discloses ESG related reports and events under its Investor Relations website ESG \u2013 Deutsche Bank (*) which\nincludes both certifications and documentations and discloses on AML, Know Your Customer (KYC) and the U.S. Patriot Act\nKYC/AML/Patriot Act \u2013 Deutsche Bank (*).\n88 Deutsche Bank Appendix\nNon-Financial Report 2022 GRI Content Index and UN Global Compact\nGRI Content Index and UN Global Compact\nGRI 1 Foundation in 2021\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Non-Financial Report provides a comprehensive disclosure of the material topics for its non-financial\nperformance.

The updated human rights governance was presented to the Supervisory Board; and the revised Statement on\nHuman Rights and the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement have been signed off by the Management Board.\n57 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nAlongside the Human Rights Forum, the above-named functions established working groups to address function specific\nhuman rights issues, e.g., the Anti-Financial Crime human rights working group which is dedicated to combatting modern\nslavery and human trafficking in the clients\u2019 business and on which further details are available below in the \u201cClients\u201d section\nof this chapter.\nMeeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened\nits procurement related human rights management processes. Further details can be found in the \u201cSupply chain\u201d section of\nthis chapter.\nDeutsche Bank has processes and channels in place to evaluate the effectiveness of its management approach to human\nrights. The bank draws on insights from the integrity hotline to assess whether the management approach with regard to\nemployees is effective or in need of further refinement. The bank evaluates effectiveness with regard to clients using a range\nof sources including transaction reviews for clients, in-house research, media reports, dialog with individual clients, and\nexchange on general trends and developments with peers. The approach to vendors is similar, consisting of information from\nthe vendor screening process supplemented by in-house research, media reports, and discussions with peers. Further details\non the bank\u2019s stakeholder engagement may be found in the chapter \u201cStakeholder engagement and thought leadership\u201d.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s human rights governance benefits from the exchange of ideas and experiences afforded by its membership\nin the Thun Group of Banks, which Deutsche Bank joined in 2012. In 2022, the bank continued to participate in the Thun\nGroup\u2019s meetings and activities relating to human rights in banking and, in particular, the United Nations Guiding Principles\non Business and Human Rights.\nKey topics in 2022\nClients\nGRI 2-23/24/25/29, 3-3, 404-2, FS1, FS3, FS4, FS5\nHuman rights due diligence is integral to Deutsche Bank\u2019s Environmental and Social Policy Framework. In order to identify,\nprevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, the bank has integrated human rights considerations in the environmental\nand social due diligence process, e.g., land rights and cultural heritage, labor and child rights, health and safety of workers\nand communities, and the rights of indigenous people. The chapter entitled \u201cEnvironmental and social due diligence\u201d, including\nthe table \u201cMain positions and minimum standards of environmental and social due diligence\u201d therein, contains more\ninformation on the related process and the principles Deutsche Bank applies.\nWhile human rights due diligence is a cross-sectoral issue, some sectors and activities have an inherently higher risk of\nnegatively impacting human rights. Thus, the Environmental and Social Policy Framework includes specific human rights-\nrelated expectations and requirements that apply to the sectors in scope of the Framework. Special attention will be paid to\ncases involving resettlement; cases where the bank identifies potential negative impacts on indigenous peoples; and cases\nwhere clients use security forces for site protection.\nIf Deutsche Bank has concerns about a client with regards to human rights, it consults with relevant stakeholders. This might\ninclude direct engagement with the client as well as with civil society representatives that are familiar with the situation. Where\nappropriate, the bank obtains the advice of independent experts. Based on all available information and its assessment of the\nrisks that have been identified, the bank decides on the further course of action, which may include termination of a business\nrelationship.\nThe implementation of the Equator Principles (*), which the bank officially adopted in 2020, further underscores its human\nrights risk assessments for eligible projects and its commitment to human rights preservation for transactions outside the\nscope of the Equator Principles. In 2022, the bank continued to conduct comprehensive trainings to ensure that relevant\nbusiness areas have an in-depth understanding of the Equator Principles as well as the requirements for assessing the impacts\non potential rights holders in the various projects that it finances.\nThe bank-wide framework for the prevention of Financial Crime contributes to preventing, deterring and detecting client\nactivities that might be linked to potential human rights violations. Being a global financial institution that provides a broad\nrange of products and services exposes Deutsche Bank to diverse financial crime risks, including modern slavery and human\ntrafficking. The Principles for the Management of Financial Crime Risks outline the responsibilities and accountabilities of the\nAnti-Financial Crime Function and of all employees at Deutsche Bank Group and describe the essential organizational\nrequirements and relevant processes for the management of financial crime risks across the 1st and 2nd Line of Defense\n(\u2018LoD\u2019). Global Anti-Financial Crime policies define minimum standards for managing financial crime risks, including those with\nimplications for human rights. These bank-wide polices are supplemented by country-specific policies and procedures that\nreflect national laws and regulations.\n58 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nThe Anti-Financial Crime human rights working group, which is part of the above-described bank-wide Human Rights Forum,\nwas established in 2021 to develop and pursue concrete measures and initiatives within the Anti-Financial Crime function to\nfight modern slavery and human trafficking. As a practical example of the progress made in 2022, modern slavery and human\ntrafficking related key risk drivers were incorporated within Deutsche Bank\u2019s Non-Financial Risk Taxonomy. This is going to\nfurther support the enhancement of Deutsche Bank\u2019s control framework.\nIndependent of the working group the Anti-Financial Crime department pro-actively contributed to initiatives within several\nPublic Private Partnerships. Deutsche Bank is currently leading the workstream \u201cFinancial Flows of Human Trafficking\u201d within\nthe German Public Privat Partnership Anti-Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA) and is part of a taskforce covering among other\ntopics human trafficking in the Europol Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP). In October 2022 the bank\nhosted an event organized by the Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking (FAST) initiative.\nTo reinforce employees\u2019 awareness of activities linked to potential human rights violations the bank conducts periodic trainings.\nOne specific example is a 45-minute mandatory online course on anti-money laundering (AML) and the prevention of terrorist\nand proliferation financing - topics that have potential connections to human rights violation. Every Deutsche Bank employee\nworldwide must complete the module once every year. Around 99% of staff (including in-scope contingent workers) did so in\n2022.\nMandatory Risk Awareness training is also deployed to all staff every other year. This online training now includes a specific\ncase on modern slavery in the private banking business and includes a question for learners on typical risk indicators. This\nupdated course was launched in the fourth quarter of 2022 to English speaking staff and is going to be rolled out as translated\nversions in non-English speaking locations at the beginning of the second quarter 2023.\nSupply chain\nGRI 2-6/25, 3-3\nThe products and services that Deutsche Bank buys, who it buys from, and how it consumes has a significant influence on its\nsustainability footprint. For this reason, sourcing and procurement activities play a key role in the bank\u2019s ambitions to respect\nand improve human rights.\nWhile the divisions are accountable for the suppliers they use, the Global Procurement function leads on the vast majority of\nsourcing and procurement decisions. In support of this, globally consistent processes and procedures are in place to govern\nthe sourcing and procurement of goods and services, onboarding of suppliers and the ongoing management of supplier\nperformance. Suppliers are required to meet a range of requirements including financial health, anti-fraud and corruption, and\ncompliance checks to engage with Deutsche Bank.\nSupplier Code of Conduct\nThe intention of the Supplier Code of Conduct (\u201cCode\u201d) is that suppliers understand the core values and standards of behavior\nthat Deutsche Bank expects its suppliers to conform to when providing goods and services. The Code is acknowledged by\nthe supplier responding to a request for proposal and on starting an engagement with Deutsche Bank, suppliers are expected\nto provide a copy of this Code to its personnel who will be involved in the supply of the goods and services.\nThe Code contains sections on Compliance with Law, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Sustainability, and Corporate\nSocial Responsibility. The Code is available on Deutsche Bank\u2019s public supplier portal (*).\nScreening of the bank\u2019s vendors for adequate social and environmental standards\nThe bank undertakes the assessment of prospective vendors\u2019 environmental and social standards starting with a questionnaire\nanalyzing the significance of potential social or environmental impacts related to a vendor\u2019s service delivery. Conditional on\nthe results of this analysis, the vendor risk management process may further scrutinize the potential for sustainability risks.\nFor vendors, with which Deutsche Bank spend more than \u20ac 500,000 annually vendor balanced scorecards were launched.\nThese scorecards evaluate vendors across a holistic set of key performance indicators. This evaluation includes a\nsustainability performance indicator which is either the rating score provided by EcoVadis or the vendor can use an equivalent\nreputable sustainability rating agency. From July 2022, the prerequisite for every new or prolonged contract worth more than\n\u20ac 500,000 a year is that the vendor has an external sustainability rating from EcoVadis or other rating agencies (*). To that\nend, the bank maintains a registration website (*) where vendors can obtain relevant information and start their assessments\nwith the sustainability rating agency, EcoVadis.\n59 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nMeeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened\nits procurement related human rights management processes. Based on a respective risk analysis, the bank adopted a risk\nmanagement system targeted at minimizing human rights adverse impacts across its supply chain. In addition to the above\nrequirements with regards to the submission of an external ESG rating, the bank enhanced preventive measures, including\nvendor due diligence, contract clauses according to vendors\u2019 risk profile and standardized processes for remedial action in\ncase of actual human rights incidents in the bank\u2019s supply chain. The process for remedial actions is triggered by a variety of\nobservations: incidents being flagged in Deutsche Bank\u2019s risk review cycles, reported incidents through internal and external\ncomplaints channels, incidents being identified in adverse media monitoring and allegations directly reported to Deutsche\nBank, e.g., by NGOs or media. In such cases, the incidents will be further investigated and appropriate measures to remedy\nthe adverse effects will be agreed with the vendor and monitored over time. The brand DWS is not covered by the management\napproach related to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act described in this section.\nEmployees\nGRI 3-3, FS4\nDeutsche Bank aims to be an \u2018employer of choice\u2019 for existing and future employees. The bank strives to create a workplace\nthat is both diverse and supportive and which is always welcoming of different views. The bank encourages high standards of\nconduct and work performance and is committed to providing a working environment free from harassment, discrimination\nand retaliation.\nGiven the activities it undertakes and the geographies in which it operates, Deutsche Bank\u2019s own operations have only limited\nexposure to adverse impacts from human rights violations. The bank aims to continue to monitor the safeguarding of human\nrights using a risk-based approach and focusing on those geographies where human rights issues are most likely to occur\nand where the bank has a material presence.\nDeutsche Bank is guided by the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\nas well as applicable labor laws in the different jurisdictions in which it operates. This includes sovereign state legislation on\ncollective agreements, bargaining and freedom of association. In countries where internationally recognized standards may\nnot be fully implemented, the bank aims to honor the principles of internationally recognized human rights.\nThe bank expects all employees to understand their responsibilities and to act in accordance with its policies, procedures, and\ninitiatives regarding human rights. The bank reinforces this awareness through bank-wide training. For example, 86.8% of\nemployees completed trainings on compliance and ethics that also include aspects of human rights in 2022 (2021 excluding\nPostbank: 93.3%). The bank investigated all employee grievances reported to the integrity hotline in 2022. If violations were\nidentified, they were reported to the appropriate functions, and the necessary steps were taken.\n60 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Public policy and regulation\nPublic policy and regulation\n\u2013 Continuing political dialogue\n\u2013 Clear rules for engagement with politicians and regulators\n\u2013 Sustainable finance, Basel III and digitalization of particular importance\nGRI 3-3\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive, complex, and frequently reviewed policies and regulations. This exposes the\nbank to significant regulatory risks. Deutsche Bank systematically prioritizes these risks and assigns clear accountability for\nidentifying regulatory changes, assessing their impact, and taking the steps necessary to ensure compliance.\nGovernance\nGRI 2-13, 3-3, FS3\nDeutsche Bank has a clearly structured framework for managing the risk of regulatory change and enhancing its profile in\npolicy and regulatory debates. The framework enables Deutsche Bank to engage with relevant regulatory and political\nstakeholders. It also ensures informed strategic decision-making and provides oversight and control over how key regulatory\ninitiatives are implemented. Amid greater regulatory activity worldwide, advocacy has become even more important for the\nbank.\nThe Political Affairs function is responsible for conducting transparent and constructive government and regulatory advocacy\non behalf of the bank. The function\u2019s aim is for this advocacy to support not only the bank but also the governments and\nregulators, as well as all Deutsche Bank\u2019s stakeholders: employees, clients, investors, and the countries where the bank\noperates. The Political Affairs function also monitors emerging policymaking and regulatory developments that may impact\nthe bank and develops and coordinates the bank\u2019s position on them. In addition, it advises senior management and clients on\nglobal political trends and geopolitical risk. Effective September 2022, this function is assigned from the Chief Executive Officer\nto the Global Head of Corporate Affairs & Strategy, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer. All other responsibilities and\nsetup did not change.\nThe global Political Affairs team is led by the Global Head of Political Affairs, who reports directly to the Global Head of\nCorporate Affairs & Strategy. The team consists of around 20 employees (Full Time Equivalent, FTE) in key business and\npolitical hubs: Frankfurt, London, New York, Berlin, Brussels, and Washington.\nThe Political Affairs function works closely with the Regulatory Affairs function. The latter is the principal point of contact for\nkey supervisors and is responsible for managing the bank\u2019s relationships and collaboration with them. It also supports senior\nmanagement\u2019s interactions with these supervisors. The Regulatory Affairs function provides insights into emerging supervisory\npriorities so that the bank can respond swiftly and appropriately, and ensures continual focus on ongoing matters, such as\nonsite visits as well as findings and commitments. The function is led by the Global Head of Regulatory Affairs, who reports\ndirectly to the Chief Administrative Officer.\nEmployee-stakeholder interaction\nGRI 2-12/23, FS1\nDeutsche Bank sets clear rules and procedures for interactions between employees and policy and regulatory stakeholders.\nThe Supervisory Authorities Engagement Policy governs interactions with core regulators in the United States, Europe, Hong\nKong, and Singapore. It requires all such interactions to be logged and minuted by the relevant Regulatory Management\nGroup. In addition, interactions with the German Federal Government and the German Parliament as well as with the EU\ninstitutions must comply with the bank\u2019s policy on Representation of Interests. This policy sets the standards for interactions\nwith representatives of the German Federal Government and the German Parliament as well as of the EU institutions. It\nprovides a centralized clearance of the contacts with representatives of these institutions in so far, they are carried out with\nthe aim of directly or indirectly influencing the decision-making process and especially the formulation or implementation of\npolicy or legislation. Deutsche Bank also has policies regarding its U.S. lobbying activities and employees\u2019 political\ncontributions to Deutsche Bank Americas\u2019 Political Action Committee (for more information, see \u201cGroup policy does not permit\ndonations to political parties\u201d below).\n81 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Public policy and regulation\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank has a global policy in place to ensure that its communications with supervisory authorities are\nconsistent. Regarding engagements in political dialogue, all employees must adhere to the bank\u2019s global Anti-Bribery and\nCorruption Policy. This policy lays out rules for the offering and acceptance of gifts by Deutsche Bank employees, employees\u2019\nparticipation in events organized by third parties, and the associated record keeping.\nFinancial transparency\nGRI 415-1\nThe bank is a signatory to the EU Transparency Register (*), which requires it to comply with the register\u2019s code of conduct\nand to disclose an estimation of expenditures for advocacy toward EU institutions. In 2022, the bank had three employees\n(full time equivalent) focused on political engagement in the EU. Annual estimated costs related to activities covered by the\nRegister were \u20ac 1,750,000 to \u20ac 1,999,999. These costs consisted of, among other things, expenses for the bank\u2018s Brussels\noffices, including staff there as well as staff outside of Brussels and a percentage of membership fees in associations active\nat the EU level.\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank is a signatory to the Federal German Lobbying Register, which requires to comply with a code of\nconduct and to disclose, among others, an estimation of expenditures for advocacy toward the Federal German Government\nand German Parliament. Annual estimated costs, based on the provision of law and related to activities covered by the\nRegister, were \u20ac 3,570,001 to \u20ac 3,580,000. In addition, Deutsche Bank is also reported in the respective Lobbying Registers\nin the States of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Those registers improve the transparency of Deutsche Bank\u2019s political\nengagement in Germany.\nGroup policy does not permit donations to political parties\nGRI 2-23, FS1\nPursuant to the bank\u2019s Group Policy on Donations, Memberships & Sponsorships, the Group does not permit direct or indirect\ndonations to political parties. The bank\u2019s Anti-Bribery and Corruption function must pre-approve donations to organizations\naffiliated with political parties or activities relating to governments and/or political parties.\nEmployees who are U.S. Citizens or green card holders living in the United States may make voluntary donations to the\nDeutsche Bank Americas\u2019 Political Action Committee (PAC). The PAC is regulated by the U.S. Federal Election Commission;\nthe PAC makes monthly public filings to the Federal Election Commission as required by law. Corporate contributions to\nfederal elections are prohibited. U.S. law therefore prohibits contributions by the bank to the PAC, although the bank may pay\nthe PAC\u2019s administrative costs.\nMemberships in trade associations\nGRI 2-28, 415-1\nDeutsche Bank is a member of a number of trade associations globally. Deutsche Bank engages with trade associations and\nbrings in inhouse experts into their relevant working groups, supports their work on consultation processes and filters back\nfeedback on their positions where Deutsche Bank considers this relevant or can leverage inhouse expertise. The Chief\nExecutive Officer Christian Sewing is president of the Associations of German Banks (Bundesverband deutscher Banken,\nBdB) and designated president of the European Banking Federation (EBF \u2013 starting March 2023), he has highlighted the\nrelevance of the banking sector to shape the transformation to a digital and sustainable economy.\n82 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nAnti-financial crime\n\u2013 Preventing, deterring, detecting and reporting financial crime\n\u2013 Maintaining a regular dialogue with supervisory control functions\n\u2013 Continuing to increase investments in financial crime controls\nVision and mission\nGRI 2-12/23/24, 3-3\nFinancial crime has a detrimental impact on society and can have severe consequences for individuals. Organized crime\nengages in fraud, bribery, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing as well as human, drug and arms trafficking. The\noutcome harms individuals, institutions, and the integrity of the financial system.\nCriminals use complex schemes including targeted placement and layering across different borders in their attempt to integrate\nthe proceeds of their crimes back into the global financial system.\nDeutsche Bank is targeted directly by criminal organizations who want to exploit the bank\u2019s global financial products and\nservices to support their illegal activities. Effective anti-financial crime controls are critical components of Deutsche Bank\u2019s\nstrategy to prevent, detect, and report these illegal activities. This includes in-depth knowledge about Deutsche Bank\u2019s\ncustomers, their source of funds, and their source of wealth. If criminals find a way around these control measures, individuals\nor institutions can be harmed and Deutsche Bank can suffer reputational damage as well as severe financial penalties.\nFighting financial crime is an integral part of the bank\u2019s business activities and continuous improvements to the Group\u2019s\ncapabilities in fighting financial crime are a critical priority. The Management Board, and all employees, are required to adhere\nto the highest standards of conduct to fight financial crime. Every employee is responsible for the management of financial\ncrime risk. This includes: (i) The prevention of financial crime by observing obligations, policies and procedures. All financial\ncrime risk policies are available in a dedicated policy portal, reviewed annually and changes are communicated to all\nemployees. Familiarity is reinforced through mandatory training and failure to comply can lead to disciplinary action. (ii) The\ndetection of unusual or suspicious behavior or patterns including the use of transaction monitoring systems which generate\nalerts that are reviewed by dedicated and trained teams of employees and (iii) The reporting of customers, third parties and/or\ntransactions that appear unusual.\nGovernance\n\nThe ultimate decision and authority regarding financial crime risks lies with the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer, who is,\nat the same time, the Head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Anti-Financial Crime function (AFC) and reports to the Chief Administration\nOfficer. The Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer is a delegated authority from the Management Board authorized to establish\na financial crime risk management framework and take any measures necessary to manage financial crime risks appropriately\nand in consideration of applicable legal requirements. AFC acts as an independent function, setting policies and standards for\nthe management and mitigation of financial crime risks at Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank\u2019s business divisions are responsible\nand accountable for the implementation and operationalization of these policies and standards. The Management Board\nensures that AFC can execute its tasks independently and effectively.\nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank is informed about the status of financial crime risk management on a regular basis\nby the Management Board and the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer according to German law. For example, the Group\nAnti-Money Laundering Officer and the responsible Management Board member provided quarterly updates to the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\nThe Supervisory Board and Management Board execute strong engagement and tone from the top with focus on compliance\nand financial crime risk matters in key committees. The Supervisory Board is well staffed and equipped to oversee the bank\u2019s\nefforts in this regard. Since 2020, the Supervisory Board has set-up a dedicated Financial Crime Risk Working Group to\nconduct additional monitoring and to provide holistic advice to the Management Board for the purpose of remedying\nshortcomings in the Anti-Money Laundering function. In 2022, the Regulatory Oversight Committee has been established,\nwhich is mandated to provide central oversight across regulatory engagement and remediation across the bank.\n85 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nKey topics in 2022\nGRI 3-3\nResources and transformation execution\nThere are dedicated employees within AFC, the business divisions, and Deutsche Bank\u2019s technology function whose main\ntask is to manage financial crime risks. In 2022, AFC initiated a hiring strategy to strengthen execution and leadership\ncapabilities, which led to a substantial increase of AFC\u2019s headcount. The AFC leadership team was enhanced with a number\nof senior hires including heads for the regions Americas, United Kingdom and Ireland, and a Head of Financial Crime Data &\nRisk Intelligence. At year end 2022, AFC had 1,932 employees (Full Time Equivalent, FTE), which is an increase of 343 FTE\nas compared to 2021. At year end 2022, AFC was also supported by 192 contingent workers.\nBeyond hiring, Deutsche Bank continued to execute core change initiatives focused on remediating internally and externally\nidentified issues and proactively enhancing controls for financial crime risks. The oversight of the central financial crime risk\nremediation program now falls under the additional oversight of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Transformation Office for consistency\nand to support the integration across remediation plans. This central program is expected to move Deutsche Bank into a\nsustainable environment, including robust Know Your Client (KYC) checks by business divisions for client adoption, ongoing\nmonitoring by control functions, dynamic risk assessments, risk appetite matching and independent audits by a specialized\naudit team.\nPartnerships\nThe fight against financial crime requires an exchange of knowledge and experiences to improve and further develop an\neffective management of financial crime risks. In 2022, Deutsche Bank deepened its existing industry engagements by\nstrengthening its ties with its associations, such as the Wolfsberg Group of Banks, but also its involvement in public private\npartnerships (collaborations between the public and private sector), such as (1) the German Anti Financial Crime Alliance\n(AFCA) which is composed of representatives from both the financial and non-financial sector, as well as the public authorities\nincluding Germany\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr\nFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA) and where\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Management Board member Stefan Simon became part of the AFCA Board; (2) Europol\u2019s Financial\nIntelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP) where the deputy Head of AFC became part of EFIPPP\u2019s Steering Group\nand (3) the UK Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank and Visa announced a\ncollaboration on the prevention of online retail frauds with an automated fraud detection system, Cybersource, owned by Visa.\nRussian sanctions\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against Russian state entities, companies and\nindividuals linked to Russia. Deutsche Bank manages these sanctions with enhanced communications, guidance, and\noperational support led by AFC\u2019s Sanctions & Embargoes team.\nOrders and fines related to financial crime risk\nOn September 28, 2022, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank AG to take specific measures aimed at preventing money laundering\nand terrorist financing in order to implement the orders that BaFin issued on September 21, 2018, and February 15, 2019.\nIn July 2022 the bank accepted a fine of \u20ac 7 million for the administrative offence of delayed filing of two Suspicious Activity\nReports (SAR) in a historic matter thereby ending the Frankfurt public prosecutor\u2019s investigation into this matter, in relation to\nwhich a search took place at Deutsche Bank\u2019s headquarters on April 29, 2022.\nRisk exposure and controls\nGRI 2-23/24/25/26, 3-3, 205-1/2/3, FS1, FS3\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s inherent exposure to financial crime risks is influenced by its clients\u2019 footprint and transaction behavior, the\ngeographies in which it operates, the products and services offered, and the sales channels used. The exposure to various\nfinancial crime risks is subsumed under money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions and embargoes, internal and external\nfraud and bribery and corruption.\n86 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing are significant risks to Deutsche Bank, e.g., in the Corporate Bank which provides\nbanking facilities to correspondent banks and their customers. To control these risks, minimum control standards are defined\nincluding, among others, risk-based client due diligence, the monitoring of transactions, name list screening, investigation of\nalerts and the filing of suspicious activity reports to authorities. These Suspicious Activity Reports can be triggered by alerts\nfrom Transaction Monitoring, internal referrals from employees, enquiries of law enforcement or referrals from other banks.\nFurther measures include assessing the risk exposure in the client population and reducing the exposure through, for example,\nterminating relevant client relationships and liquidating or reducing risk in relevant and associated positions. The Anti-Money\nLaundering Policy contains the minimum control requirements and is updated regularly in line with regulatory developments\nand supplemented with internal safeguarding measures.\nSanctions and embargos\nDeutsche Bank is committed to complying with sanctions imposed by the United Nations, European Union, and Germany\nglobally as well as sanctions applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates, especially the United States and United\nKingdom. To control this risk, transactions are filtered, client and counterparty data is screened, trade in sanctioned financial\ninstruments is restricted, and further measures such as rejecting or freezing a transaction, restricting client activities, or exiting\na client relationship are taken. The Sanctions Policy \u2013 Deutsche Bank Group sets out the requirements and standards that\napply globally within the bank.\nAnti-fraud, bribery and corruption\nDeutsche Bank has no tolerance for its employees, or third parties acting on its behalf, to engage in bribery or corruption and\nis committed to compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. On an annual basis\nthe Bank undertakes an assessment of inherent bribery and corruption risks and corresponding controls across all of its\nbusinesses. All Bank employees, including board members, are required to complete mandatory online anti-bribery and\ncorruption training. Employees who do not complete their training are subject to potential disciplinary action. The bank has\npolicies, procedures, and controls to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption across key risk areas such as gifts and\nentertainment, hiring practices, use of third-party intermediaries, and participation in joint ventures as well as in strategic\ninvestments. These controls include the escalation of approvals, enhanced due diligence, contractual limitations, and ongoing\nmonitoring to identify behaviors that could be indicative of bribery and corruption. As with all AFC policies, changes to the anti-\ncorruption policies are communicated to all employees. The Bank has continued to reduce its exposure to areas that present\na higher inherent risk of bribery and corruption, such as use of Business Development Consultants. Finally, potential instances\nof bribery or corruption would be investigated, and any employee determined to be engaged in such behavior would be subject\nto disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\nThe Bank has implemented a holistic Fraud Risk Management Framework across all Lines of Defense, defining governance\nand minimum standards, and establishing key controls to mitigate the risk of fraud, such as Mandatory Time Away and Fraud\nTransaction Monitoring.\nTargets and measures\nGRI 2-24/26, 3-3, 205-2, 404-2, FS4\nAt Deutsche Bank, AFC defines the uniform strategy for the prevention of financial crime, including the preparation of group-\nwide policies and overseeing the implementation. The accountability for the definition and regular review of the risks controlled\nby AFC lies with the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer. In order to be able to understand the required measures, it is\nimportant to capture, identify and weigh the financial crime risk Deutsche Bank is faced with. AFC regularly conducts an\nanalysis of the financial crime risks and prepares a risk assessment for Deutsche Bank Group, as well as relevant subsidiaries\nto the extent required by applicable legal requirements. The risk analysis is reviewed annually and approved by the responsible\nManagement Board member. Changes within the organization, but also the offering of new products can have an impact on\nthe bank\u2019s risk exposure.\nAFC is involved in structural divisional changes such as new products, new lines of business, expansions to new countries or\nnew client categories to ensure the changes are within the Bank\u2019s risk appetite and that effective risk assessment, monitoring\nand controls are defined before their launch. In order to adjust the strategy in a timely way to an ever-changing legal\nenvironment, AFC monitors requirements and advises and supports the Management Board and employees in the business\ndivisions on changed requirements and their implementation into relevant policies.\n87 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s most critical asset against financial crime risks are its employees. Deutsche Bank promotes a risk culture\nthat encourages employees to speak-up and a thorough awareness for financial crime risks. Deutsche Bank has carefully\nnurtured a culture of compliance and integrity in the bank, including the fight against financial crime. Tone from the top is\nextremely important and senior management is highly committed to drive cultural change through behavioral changes and\nreinforcing the change. Culture initiatives are driven both on group and divisional level across Deutsche Bank and a culture\nreview framework is in place to identify areas that may be exhibiting poor culture to act through targeted culture reviews.\nSpecial focus is put on speak-up, which is subject of wide-ranging training efforts and communication campaigns.\nRegular (at least annual) training for all employees is conducted covering all financial crime risks and testing their policy\nknowledge. There is a mandatory curriculum accompanied by other additional facultative training offerings. The training\nmodules highlight the importance of identifying financial crime risks and raising concerns or suspicions including the use of\nthe anonymous whistle-blower hotline. Modules articulate personal, professional, financial, regulatory, and societal\nconsequences of failing to manage financial crime risks. A completion rate of 99,96% has been achieved for the learners\nrequired to complete the mandatory anti-financial crime training by year end 2022. Learners who have not completed the\ntraining within the final due date are reported to the Compliance red flag team for investigation and may receive a red flag, if\neligible. Management Board members receive ongoing periodic online training about financial crime topics as well as in-person\ntailored training and briefings on topics such as the risks of cryptocurrency.\nDeutsche Bank discloses ESG related reports and events under its Investor Relations website ESG \u2013 Deutsche Bank (*) which\nincludes both certifications and documentations and discloses on AML, Know Your Customer (KYC) and the U.S. Patriot Act\nKYC/AML/Patriot Act \u2013 Deutsche Bank (*).\n88 Deutsche Bank Appendix\nNon-Financial Report 2022 GRI Content Index and UN Global Compact\nGRI Content Index and UN Global Compact\nGRI 1 Foundation in 2021\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Non-Financial Report provides a comprehensive disclosure of the material topics for its non-financial\nperformance.

The bank is guided by international standards and guidelines, such as:\n\u2013 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (*)\n\u2013 International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (*)\nincluding the International Labor Organization Core Labor Standards (*)\n\u2013 UN Global Compact (*)\n\u2013 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (*)\nThe core principle of the bank\u2019s approach is to not engage in business activities where Deutsche Bank has substantiated\nevidence of material adverse human rights impacts and it is determined through Deutsche Bank\u2019s internal processes that such\nadverse human rights impacts cannot be avoided or appropriately mitigated.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Statement on Human Rights (*) describes its commitment and management approach in greater detail. The\nbank worked on a review of the Statement, which was published in March 2023, also to reflect the increased public and\nregulatory focus on the topic, including in context of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, effective from January 2023.\nThe bank\u2019s approach encompasses all dimensions of its business, from client transactions and interactions with vendors and\nservice providers to the treatment of its employees. Deutsche Bank assesses its sectoral and geographical risk exposure to\nhuman rights violations regularly and undertakes due diligence to identify and assess the nature of the actual and potential\nadverse human rights impacts with which it may be directly or indirectly linked. Deutsche Bank also annually publishes a\nModern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement (*).\nThe following subchapters address the bank\u2019s human rights governance structure and the governance and mitigation\nmeasures, it has undertaken for the different stakeholder groups, particularly for clients, suppliers, and employees.\nGovernance\nGRI 2-12/13/16/25/26, 3-3\nIn 2022, building on the former Human Rights Working Group, the Human Rights Forum was established to ensure oversight\nof Deutsche Bank\u2019s human rights management. This Forum consists of senior representatives of the following functions and\nbusiness divisions: Procurement, Anti-Financial Crime, Chief Sustainability Office, Human Resources, Legal, Non-Financial\nRisk Management, Governance as well as Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, and Private Bank. DWS is involved ad hoc as\nappropriate. The Human Rights Forum is co-chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and the Head of Group Sustainability\nand reports to the Sustainability Committee.\nVia the Human Rights Forum, which meets bimonthly, the members monitor trends, collect and share learnings from within\nDeutsche Bank, liaise with external experts and initiate strategic projects relevant for human rights management.\nIn 2022, the Human Rights Forum served as an interface for both strategic and operational actions related to Human Rights.\nAs a specific activity within the Forum, the members evaluated the implications of the draft EU Corporate Sustainability Due\nDiligence Directive. In addition, the Forum supported the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\nwhich came into force in January 2023. The members of the Human Rights Forum also engaged in preparing the\naforementioned Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement (*) as well as the updated Human Rights Statement (*) for\npublication. The updated human rights governance was presented to the Supervisory Board; and the revised Statement on\nHuman Rights and the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement have been signed off by the Management Board.\n57 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nAlongside the Human Rights Forum, the above-named functions established working groups to address function specific\nhuman rights issues, e.g., the Anti-Financial Crime human rights working group which is dedicated to combatting modern\nslavery and human trafficking in the clients\u2019 business and on which further details are available below in the \u201cClients\u201d section\nof this chapter.\nMeeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened\nits procurement related human rights management processes. Further details can be found in the \u201cSupply chain\u201d section of\nthis chapter.\nDeutsche Bank has processes and channels in place to evaluate the effectiveness of its management approach to human\nrights. The bank draws on insights from the integrity hotline to assess whether the management approach with regard to\nemployees is effective or in need of further refinement. The bank evaluates effectiveness with regard to clients using a range\nof sources including transaction reviews for clients, in-house research, media reports, dialog with individual clients, and\nexchange on general trends and developments with peers. The approach to vendors is similar, consisting of information from\nthe vendor screening process supplemented by in-house research, media reports, and discussions with peers. Further details\non the bank\u2019s stakeholder engagement may be found in the chapter \u201cStakeholder engagement and thought leadership\u201d.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s human rights governance benefits from the exchange of ideas and experiences afforded by its membership\nin the Thun Group of Banks, which Deutsche Bank joined in 2012. In 2022, the bank continued to participate in the Thun\nGroup\u2019s meetings and activities relating to human rights in banking and, in particular, the United Nations Guiding Principles\non Business and Human Rights.\nKey topics in 2022\nClients\nGRI 2-23/24/25/29, 3-3, 404-2, FS1, FS3, FS4, FS5\nHuman rights due diligence is integral to Deutsche Bank\u2019s Environmental and Social Policy Framework. In order to identify,\nprevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, the bank has integrated human rights considerations in the environmental\nand social due diligence process, e.g., land rights and cultural heritage, labor and child rights, health and safety of workers\nand communities, and the rights of indigenous people. The chapter entitled \u201cEnvironmental and social due diligence\u201d, including\nthe table \u201cMain positions and minimum standards of environmental and social due diligence\u201d therein, contains more\ninformation on the related process and the principles Deutsche Bank applies.\nWhile human rights due diligence is a cross-sectoral issue, some sectors and activities have an inherently higher risk of\nnegatively impacting human rights. Thus, the Environmental and Social Policy Framework includes specific human rights-\nrelated expectations and requirements that apply to the sectors in scope of the Framework. Special attention will be paid to\ncases involving resettlement; cases where the bank identifies potential negative impacts on indigenous peoples; and cases\nwhere clients use security forces for site protection.\nIf Deutsche Bank has concerns about a client with regards to human rights, it consults with relevant stakeholders. This might\ninclude direct engagement with the client as well as with civil society representatives that are familiar with the situation. Where\nappropriate, the bank obtains the advice of independent experts. Based on all available information and its assessment of the\nrisks that have been identified, the bank decides on the further course of action, which may include termination of a business\nrelationship.\nThe implementation of the Equator Principles (*), which the bank officially adopted in 2020, further underscores its human\nrights risk assessments for eligible projects and its commitment to human rights preservation for transactions outside the\nscope of the Equator Principles. In 2022, the bank continued to conduct comprehensive trainings to ensure that relevant\nbusiness areas have an in-depth understanding of the Equator Principles as well as the requirements for assessing the impacts\non potential rights holders in the various projects that it finances.\nThe bank-wide framework for the prevention of Financial Crime contributes to preventing, deterring and detecting client\nactivities that might be linked to potential human rights violations. Being a global financial institution that provides a broad\nrange of products and services exposes Deutsche Bank to diverse financial crime risks, including modern slavery and human\ntrafficking. The Principles for the Management of Financial Crime Risks outline the responsibilities and accountabilities of the\nAnti-Financial Crime Function and of all employees at Deutsche Bank Group and describe the essential organizational\nrequirements and relevant processes for the management of financial crime risks across the 1st and 2nd Line of Defense\n(\u2018LoD\u2019). Global Anti-Financial Crime policies define minimum standards for managing financial crime risks, including those with\nimplications for human rights. These bank-wide polices are supplemented by country-specific policies and procedures that\nreflect national laws and regulations.\n58 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nThe Anti-Financial Crime human rights working group, which is part of the above-described bank-wide Human Rights Forum,\nwas established in 2021 to develop and pursue concrete measures and initiatives within the Anti-Financial Crime function to\nfight modern slavery and human trafficking. As a practical example of the progress made in 2022, modern slavery and human\ntrafficking related key risk drivers were incorporated within Deutsche Bank\u2019s Non-Financial Risk Taxonomy. This is going to\nfurther support the enhancement of Deutsche Bank\u2019s control framework.\nIndependent of the working group the Anti-Financial Crime department pro-actively contributed to initiatives within several\nPublic Private Partnerships. Deutsche Bank is currently leading the workstream \u201cFinancial Flows of Human Trafficking\u201d within\nthe German Public Privat Partnership Anti-Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA) and is part of a taskforce covering among other\ntopics human trafficking in the Europol Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP). In October 2022 the bank\nhosted an event organized by the Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking (FAST) initiative.\nTo reinforce employees\u2019 awareness of activities linked to potential human rights violations the bank conducts periodic trainings.\nOne specific example is a 45-minute mandatory online course on anti-money laundering (AML) and the prevention of terrorist\nand proliferation financing - topics that have potential connections to human rights violation. Every Deutsche Bank employee\nworldwide must complete the module once every year. Around 99% of staff (including in-scope contingent workers) did so in\n2022.\nMandatory Risk Awareness training is also deployed to all staff every other year. This online training now includes a specific\ncase on modern slavery in the private banking business and includes a question for learners on typical risk indicators. This\nupdated course was launched in the fourth quarter of 2022 to English speaking staff and is going to be rolled out as translated\nversions in non-English speaking locations at the beginning of the second quarter 2023.\nSupply chain\nGRI 2-6/25, 3-3\nThe products and services that Deutsche Bank buys, who it buys from, and how it consumes has a significant influence on its\nsustainability footprint. For this reason, sourcing and procurement activities play a key role in the bank\u2019s ambitions to respect\nand improve human rights.\nWhile the divisions are accountable for the suppliers they use, the Global Procurement function leads on the vast majority of\nsourcing and procurement decisions. In support of this, globally consistent processes and procedures are in place to govern\nthe sourcing and procurement of goods and services, onboarding of suppliers and the ongoing management of supplier\nperformance. Suppliers are required to meet a range of requirements including financial health, anti-fraud and corruption, and\ncompliance checks to engage with Deutsche Bank.\nSupplier Code of Conduct\nThe intention of the Supplier Code of Conduct (\u201cCode\u201d) is that suppliers understand the core values and standards of behavior\nthat Deutsche Bank expects its suppliers to conform to when providing goods and services. The Code is acknowledged by\nthe supplier responding to a request for proposal and on starting an engagement with Deutsche Bank, suppliers are expected\nto provide a copy of this Code to its personnel who will be involved in the supply of the goods and services.\nThe Code contains sections on Compliance with Law, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Sustainability, and Corporate\nSocial Responsibility. The Code is available on Deutsche Bank\u2019s public supplier portal (*).\nScreening of the bank\u2019s vendors for adequate social and environmental standards\nThe bank undertakes the assessment of prospective vendors\u2019 environmental and social standards starting with a questionnaire\nanalyzing the significance of potential social or environmental impacts related to a vendor\u2019s service delivery. Conditional on\nthe results of this analysis, the vendor risk management process may further scrutinize the potential for sustainability risks.\nFor vendors, with which Deutsche Bank spend more than \u20ac 500,000 annually vendor balanced scorecards were launched.\nThese scorecards evaluate vendors across a holistic set of key performance indicators. This evaluation includes a\nsustainability performance indicator which is either the rating score provided by EcoVadis or the vendor can use an equivalent\nreputable sustainability rating agency. From July 2022, the prerequisite for every new or prolonged contract worth more than\n\u20ac 500,000 a year is that the vendor has an external sustainability rating from EcoVadis or other rating agencies (*). To that\nend, the bank maintains a registration website (*) where vendors can obtain relevant information and start their assessments\nwith the sustainability rating agency, EcoVadis.\n59 Deutsche Bank Transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Human rights\nMeeting the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, Deutsche Bank further enhanced and strengthened\nits procurement related human rights management processes. Based on a respective risk analysis, the bank adopted a risk\nmanagement system targeted at minimizing human rights adverse impacts across its supply chain. In addition to the above\nrequirements with regards to the submission of an external ESG rating, the bank enhanced preventive measures, including\nvendor due diligence, contract clauses according to vendors\u2019 risk profile and standardized processes for remedial action in\ncase of actual human rights incidents in the bank\u2019s supply chain. The process for remedial actions is triggered by a variety of\nobservations: incidents being flagged in Deutsche Bank\u2019s risk review cycles, reported incidents through internal and external\ncomplaints channels, incidents being identified in adverse media monitoring and allegations directly reported to Deutsche\nBank, e.g., by NGOs or media. In such cases, the incidents will be further investigated and appropriate measures to remedy\nthe adverse effects will be agreed with the vendor and monitored over time. The brand DWS is not covered by the management\napproach related to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act described in this section.\nEmployees\nGRI 3-3, FS4\nDeutsche Bank aims to be an \u2018employer of choice\u2019 for existing and future employees. The bank strives to create a workplace\nthat is both diverse and supportive and which is always welcoming of different views. The bank encourages high standards of\nconduct and work performance and is committed to providing a working environment free from harassment, discrimination\nand retaliation.\nGiven the activities it undertakes and the geographies in which it operates, Deutsche Bank\u2019s own operations have only limited\nexposure to adverse impacts from human rights violations. The bank aims to continue to monitor the safeguarding of human\nrights using a risk-based approach and focusing on those geographies where human rights issues are most likely to occur\nand where the bank has a material presence.\nDeutsche Bank is guided by the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\nas well as applicable labor laws in the different jurisdictions in which it operates. This includes sovereign state legislation on\ncollective agreements, bargaining and freedom of association. In countries where internationally recognized standards may\nnot be fully implemented, the bank aims to honor the principles of internationally recognized human rights.\nThe bank expects all employees to understand their responsibilities and to act in accordance with its policies, procedures, and\ninitiatives regarding human rights. The bank reinforces this awareness through bank-wide training. For example, 86.8% of\nemployees completed trainings on compliance and ethics that also include aspects of human rights in 2022 (2021 excluding\nPostbank: 93.3%). The bank investigated all employee grievances reported to the integrity hotline in 2022. If violations were\nidentified, they were reported to the appropriate functions, and the necessary steps were taken.\n60 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Public policy and regulation\nPublic policy and regulation\n\u2013 Continuing political dialogue\n\u2013 Clear rules for engagement with politicians and regulators\n\u2013 Sustainable finance, Basel III and digitalization of particular importance\nGRI 3-3\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive, complex, and frequently reviewed policies and regulations. This exposes the\nbank to significant regulatory risks. Deutsche Bank systematically prioritizes these risks and assigns clear accountability for\nidentifying regulatory changes, assessing their impact, and taking the steps necessary to ensure compliance.\nGovernance\nGRI 2-13, 3-3, FS3\nDeutsche Bank has a clearly structured framework for managing the risk of regulatory change and enhancing its profile in\npolicy and regulatory debates. The framework enables Deutsche Bank to engage with relevant regulatory and political\nstakeholders. It also ensures informed strategic decision-making and provides oversight and control over how key regulatory\ninitiatives are implemented. Amid greater regulatory activity worldwide, advocacy has become even more important for the\nbank.\nThe Political Affairs function is responsible for conducting transparent and constructive government and regulatory advocacy\non behalf of the bank. The function\u2019s aim is for this advocacy to support not only the bank but also the governments and\nregulators, as well as all Deutsche Bank\u2019s stakeholders: employees, clients, investors, and the countries where the bank\noperates. The Political Affairs function also monitors emerging policymaking and regulatory developments that may impact\nthe bank and develops and coordinates the bank\u2019s position on them. In addition, it advises senior management and clients on\nglobal political trends and geopolitical risk. Effective September 2022, this function is assigned from the Chief Executive Officer\nto the Global Head of Corporate Affairs & Strategy, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer. All other responsibilities and\nsetup did not change.\nThe global Political Affairs team is led by the Global Head of Political Affairs, who reports directly to the Global Head of\nCorporate Affairs & Strategy. The team consists of around 20 employees (Full Time Equivalent, FTE) in key business and\npolitical hubs: Frankfurt, London, New York, Berlin, Brussels, and Washington.\nThe Political Affairs function works closely with the Regulatory Affairs function. The latter is the principal point of contact for\nkey supervisors and is responsible for managing the bank\u2019s relationships and collaboration with them. It also supports senior\nmanagement\u2019s interactions with these supervisors. The Regulatory Affairs function provides insights into emerging supervisory\npriorities so that the bank can respond swiftly and appropriately, and ensures continual focus on ongoing matters, such as\nonsite visits as well as findings and commitments. The function is led by the Global Head of Regulatory Affairs, who reports\ndirectly to the Chief Administrative Officer.\nEmployee-stakeholder interaction\nGRI 2-12/23, FS1\nDeutsche Bank sets clear rules and procedures for interactions between employees and policy and regulatory stakeholders.\nThe Supervisory Authorities Engagement Policy governs interactions with core regulators in the United States, Europe, Hong\nKong, and Singapore. It requires all such interactions to be logged and minuted by the relevant Regulatory Management\nGroup. In addition, interactions with the German Federal Government and the German Parliament as well as with the EU\ninstitutions must comply with the bank\u2019s policy on Representation of Interests. This policy sets the standards for interactions\nwith representatives of the German Federal Government and the German Parliament as well as of the EU institutions. It\nprovides a centralized clearance of the contacts with representatives of these institutions in so far, they are carried out with\nthe aim of directly or indirectly influencing the decision-making process and especially the formulation or implementation of\npolicy or legislation. Deutsche Bank also has policies regarding its U.S. lobbying activities and employees\u2019 political\ncontributions to Deutsche Bank Americas\u2019 Political Action Committee (for more information, see \u201cGroup policy does not permit\ndonations to political parties\u201d below).\n81 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Public policy and regulation\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank has a global policy in place to ensure that its communications with supervisory authorities are\nconsistent. Regarding engagements in political dialogue, all employees must adhere to the bank\u2019s global Anti-Bribery and\nCorruption Policy. This policy lays out rules for the offering and acceptance of gifts by Deutsche Bank employees, employees\u2019\nparticipation in events organized by third parties, and the associated record keeping.\nFinancial transparency\nGRI 415-1\nThe bank is a signatory to the EU Transparency Register (*), which requires it to comply with the register\u2019s code of conduct\nand to disclose an estimation of expenditures for advocacy toward EU institutions. In 2022, the bank had three employees\n(full time equivalent) focused on political engagement in the EU. Annual estimated costs related to activities covered by the\nRegister were \u20ac 1,750,000 to \u20ac 1,999,999. These costs consisted of, among other things, expenses for the bank\u2018s Brussels\noffices, including staff there as well as staff outside of Brussels and a percentage of membership fees in associations active\nat the EU level.\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank is a signatory to the Federal German Lobbying Register, which requires to comply with a code of\nconduct and to disclose, among others, an estimation of expenditures for advocacy toward the Federal German Government\nand German Parliament. Annual estimated costs, based on the provision of law and related to activities covered by the\nRegister, were \u20ac 3,570,001 to \u20ac 3,580,000. In addition, Deutsche Bank is also reported in the respective Lobbying Registers\nin the States of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Those registers improve the transparency of Deutsche Bank\u2019s political\nengagement in Germany.\nGroup policy does not permit donations to political parties\nGRI 2-23, FS1\nPursuant to the bank\u2019s Group Policy on Donations, Memberships & Sponsorships, the Group does not permit direct or indirect\ndonations to political parties. The bank\u2019s Anti-Bribery and Corruption function must pre-approve donations to organizations\naffiliated with political parties or activities relating to governments and/or political parties.\nEmployees who are U.S. Citizens or green card holders living in the United States may make voluntary donations to the\nDeutsche Bank Americas\u2019 Political Action Committee (PAC). The PAC is regulated by the U.S. Federal Election Commission;\nthe PAC makes monthly public filings to the Federal Election Commission as required by law. Corporate contributions to\nfederal elections are prohibited. U.S. law therefore prohibits contributions by the bank to the PAC, although the bank may pay\nthe PAC\u2019s administrative costs.\nMemberships in trade associations\nGRI 2-28, 415-1\nDeutsche Bank is a member of a number of trade associations globally. Deutsche Bank engages with trade associations and\nbrings in inhouse experts into their relevant working groups, supports their work on consultation processes and filters back\nfeedback on their positions where Deutsche Bank considers this relevant or can leverage inhouse expertise. The Chief\nExecutive Officer Christian Sewing is president of the Associations of German Banks (Bundesverband deutscher Banken,\nBdB) and designated president of the European Banking Federation (EBF \u2013 starting March 2023), he has highlighted the\nrelevance of the banking sector to shape the transformation to a digital and sustainable economy.\n82 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nAnti-financial crime\n\u2013 Preventing, deterring, detecting and reporting financial crime\n\u2013 Maintaining a regular dialogue with supervisory control functions\n\u2013 Continuing to increase investments in financial crime controls\nVision and mission\nGRI 2-12/23/24, 3-3\nFinancial crime has a detrimental impact on society and can have severe consequences for individuals. Organized crime\nengages in fraud, bribery, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing as well as human, drug and arms trafficking. The\noutcome harms individuals, institutions, and the integrity of the financial system.\nCriminals use complex schemes including targeted placement and layering across different borders in their attempt to integrate\nthe proceeds of their crimes back into the global financial system.\nDeutsche Bank is targeted directly by criminal organizations who want to exploit the bank\u2019s global financial products and\nservices to support their illegal activities. Effective anti-financial crime controls are critical components of Deutsche Bank\u2019s\nstrategy to prevent, detect, and report these illegal activities. This includes in-depth knowledge about Deutsche Bank\u2019s\ncustomers, their source of funds, and their source of wealth. If criminals find a way around these control measures, individuals\nor institutions can be harmed and Deutsche Bank can suffer reputational damage as well as severe financial penalties.\nFighting financial crime is an integral part of the bank\u2019s business activities and continuous improvements to the Group\u2019s\ncapabilities in fighting financial crime are a critical priority. The Management Board, and all employees, are required to adhere\nto the highest standards of conduct to fight financial crime. Every employee is responsible for the management of financial\ncrime risk. This includes: (i) The prevention of financial crime by observing obligations, policies and procedures. All financial\ncrime risk policies are available in a dedicated policy portal, reviewed annually and changes are communicated to all\nemployees. Familiarity is reinforced through mandatory training and failure to comply can lead to disciplinary action. (ii) The\ndetection of unusual or suspicious behavior or patterns including the use of transaction monitoring systems which generate\nalerts that are reviewed by dedicated and trained teams of employees and (iii) The reporting of customers, third parties and/or\ntransactions that appear unusual.\nGovernance\n\nThe ultimate decision and authority regarding financial crime risks lies with the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer, who is,\nat the same time, the Head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Anti-Financial Crime function (AFC) and reports to the Chief Administration\nOfficer. The Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer is a delegated authority from the Management Board authorized to establish\na financial crime risk management framework and take any measures necessary to manage financial crime risks appropriately\nand in consideration of applicable legal requirements. AFC acts as an independent function, setting policies and standards for\nthe management and mitigation of financial crime risks at Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank\u2019s business divisions are responsible\nand accountable for the implementation and operationalization of these policies and standards. The Management Board\nensures that AFC can execute its tasks independently and effectively.\nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank is informed about the status of financial crime risk management on a regular basis\nby the Management Board and the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer according to German law. For example, the Group\nAnti-Money Laundering Officer and the responsible Management Board member provided quarterly updates to the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\nThe Supervisory Board and Management Board execute strong engagement and tone from the top with focus on compliance\nand financial crime risk matters in key committees. The Supervisory Board is well staffed and equipped to oversee the bank\u2019s\nefforts in this regard. Since 2020, the Supervisory Board has set-up a dedicated Financial Crime Risk Working Group to\nconduct additional monitoring and to provide holistic advice to the Management Board for the purpose of remedying\nshortcomings in the Anti-Money Laundering function. In 2022, the Regulatory Oversight Committee has been established,\nwhich is mandated to provide central oversight across regulatory engagement and remediation across the bank.\n85 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nKey topics in 2022\nGRI 3-3\nResources and transformation execution\nThere are dedicated employees within AFC, the business divisions, and Deutsche Bank\u2019s technology function whose main\ntask is to manage financial crime risks. In 2022, AFC initiated a hiring strategy to strengthen execution and leadership\ncapabilities, which led to a substantial increase of AFC\u2019s headcount. The AFC leadership team was enhanced with a number\nof senior hires including heads for the regions Americas, United Kingdom and Ireland, and a Head of Financial Crime Data &\nRisk Intelligence. At year end 2022, AFC had 1,932 employees (Full Time Equivalent, FTE), which is an increase of 343 FTE\nas compared to 2021. At year end 2022, AFC was also supported by 192 contingent workers.\nBeyond hiring, Deutsche Bank continued to execute core change initiatives focused on remediating internally and externally\nidentified issues and proactively enhancing controls for financial crime risks. The oversight of the central financial crime risk\nremediation program now falls under the additional oversight of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Transformation Office for consistency\nand to support the integration across remediation plans. This central program is expected to move Deutsche Bank into a\nsustainable environment, including robust Know Your Client (KYC) checks by business divisions for client adoption, ongoing\nmonitoring by control functions, dynamic risk assessments, risk appetite matching and independent audits by a specialized\naudit team.\nPartnerships\nThe fight against financial crime requires an exchange of knowledge and experiences to improve and further develop an\neffective management of financial crime risks. In 2022, Deutsche Bank deepened its existing industry engagements by\nstrengthening its ties with its associations, such as the Wolfsberg Group of Banks, but also its involvement in public private\npartnerships (collaborations between the public and private sector), such as (1) the German Anti Financial Crime Alliance\n(AFCA) which is composed of representatives from both the financial and non-financial sector, as well as the public authorities\nincluding Germany\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr\nFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA) and where\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Management Board member Stefan Simon became part of the AFCA Board; (2) Europol\u2019s Financial\nIntelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP) where the deputy Head of AFC became part of EFIPPP\u2019s Steering Group\nand (3) the UK Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank and Visa announced a\ncollaboration on the prevention of online retail frauds with an automated fraud detection system, Cybersource, owned by Visa.\nRussian sanctions\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against Russian state entities, companies and\nindividuals linked to Russia. Deutsche Bank manages these sanctions with enhanced communications, guidance, and\noperational support led by AFC\u2019s Sanctions & Embargoes team.\nOrders and fines related to financial crime risk\nOn September 28, 2022, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank AG to take specific measures aimed at preventing money laundering\nand terrorist financing in order to implement the orders that BaFin issued on September 21, 2018, and February 15, 2019.\nIn July 2022 the bank accepted a fine of \u20ac 7 million for the administrative offence of delayed filing of two Suspicious Activity\nReports (SAR) in a historic matter thereby ending the Frankfurt public prosecutor\u2019s investigation into this matter, in relation to\nwhich a search took place at Deutsche Bank\u2019s headquarters on April 29, 2022.\nRisk exposure and controls\nGRI 2-23/24/25/26, 3-3, 205-1/2/3, FS1, FS3\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s inherent exposure to financial crime risks is influenced by its clients\u2019 footprint and transaction behavior, the\ngeographies in which it operates, the products and services offered, and the sales channels used. The exposure to various\nfinancial crime risks is subsumed under money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions and embargoes, internal and external\nfraud and bribery and corruption.\n86 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing are significant risks to Deutsche Bank, e.g., in the Corporate Bank which provides\nbanking facilities to correspondent banks and their customers. To control these risks, minimum control standards are defined\nincluding, among others, risk-based client due diligence, the monitoring of transactions, name list screening, investigation of\nalerts and the filing of suspicious activity reports to authorities. These Suspicious Activity Reports can be triggered by alerts\nfrom Transaction Monitoring, internal referrals from employees, enquiries of law enforcement or referrals from other banks.\nFurther measures include assessing the risk exposure in the client population and reducing the exposure through, for example,\nterminating relevant client relationships and liquidating or reducing risk in relevant and associated positions. The Anti-Money\nLaundering Policy contains the minimum control requirements and is updated regularly in line with regulatory developments\nand supplemented with internal safeguarding measures.\nSanctions and embargos\nDeutsche Bank is committed to complying with sanctions imposed by the United Nations, European Union, and Germany\nglobally as well as sanctions applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates, especially the United States and United\nKingdom. To control this risk, transactions are filtered, client and counterparty data is screened, trade in sanctioned financial\ninstruments is restricted, and further measures such as rejecting or freezing a transaction, restricting client activities, or exiting\na client relationship are taken. The Sanctions Policy \u2013 Deutsche Bank Group sets out the requirements and standards that\napply globally within the bank.\nAnti-fraud, bribery and corruption\nDeutsche Bank has no tolerance for its employees, or third parties acting on its behalf, to engage in bribery or corruption and\nis committed to compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. On an annual basis\nthe Bank undertakes an assessment of inherent bribery and corruption risks and corresponding controls across all of its\nbusinesses. All Bank employees, including board members, are required to complete mandatory online anti-bribery and\ncorruption training. Employees who do not complete their training are subject to potential disciplinary action. The bank has\npolicies, procedures, and controls to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption across key risk areas such as gifts and\nentertainment, hiring practices, use of third-party intermediaries, and participation in joint ventures as well as in strategic\ninvestments. These controls include the escalation of approvals, enhanced due diligence, contractual limitations, and ongoing\nmonitoring to identify behaviors that could be indicative of bribery and corruption. As with all AFC policies, changes to the anti-\ncorruption policies are communicated to all employees. The Bank has continued to reduce its exposure to areas that present\na higher inherent risk of bribery and corruption, such as use of Business Development Consultants. Finally, potential instances\nof bribery or corruption would be investigated, and any employee determined to be engaged in such behavior would be subject\nto disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\nThe Bank has implemented a holistic Fraud Risk Management Framework across all Lines of Defense, defining governance\nand minimum standards, and establishing key controls to mitigate the risk of fraud, such as Mandatory Time Away and Fraud\nTransaction Monitoring.\nTargets and measures\nGRI 2-24/26, 3-3, 205-2, 404-2, FS4\nAt Deutsche Bank, AFC defines the uniform strategy for the prevention of financial crime, including the preparation of group-\nwide policies and overseeing the implementation. The accountability for the definition and regular review of the risks controlled\nby AFC lies with the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer. In order to be able to understand the required measures, it is\nimportant to capture, identify and weigh the financial crime risk Deutsche Bank is faced with. AFC regularly conducts an\nanalysis of the financial crime risks and prepares a risk assessment for Deutsche Bank Group, as well as relevant subsidiaries\nto the extent required by applicable legal requirements. The risk analysis is reviewed annually and approved by the responsible\nManagement Board member. Changes within the organization, but also the offering of new products can have an impact on\nthe bank\u2019s risk exposure.\nAFC is involved in structural divisional changes such as new products, new lines of business, expansions to new countries or\nnew client categories to ensure the changes are within the Bank\u2019s risk appetite and that effective risk assessment, monitoring\nand controls are defined before their launch. In order to adjust the strategy in a timely way to an ever-changing legal\nenvironment, AFC monitors requirements and advises and supports the Management Board and employees in the business\ndivisions on changed requirements and their implementation into relevant policies.\n87 Deutsche Bank Governance and operations\nNon-Financial Report 2022 Anti-financial crime\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s most critical asset against financial crime risks are its employees. Deutsche Bank promotes a risk culture\nthat encourages employees to speak-up and a thorough awareness for financial crime risks. Deutsche Bank has carefully\nnurtured a culture of compliance and integrity in the bank, including the fight against financial crime. Tone from the top is\nextremely important and senior management is highly committed to drive cultural change through behavioral changes and\nreinforcing the change. Culture initiatives are driven both on group and divisional level across Deutsche Bank and a culture\nreview framework is in place to identify areas that may be exhibiting poor culture to act through targeted culture reviews.\nSpecial focus is put on speak-up, which is subject of wide-ranging training efforts and communication campaigns.\nRegular (at least annual) training for all employees is conducted covering all financial crime risks and testing their policy\nknowledge. There is a mandatory curriculum accompanied by other additional facultative training offerings. The training\nmodules highlight the importance of identifying financial crime risks and raising concerns or suspicions including the use of\nthe anonymous whistle-blower hotline. Modules articulate personal, professional, financial, regulatory, and societal\nconsequences of failing to manage financial crime risks. A completion rate of 99,96% has been achieved for the learners\nrequired to complete the mandatory anti-financial crime training by year end 2022. Learners who have not completed the\ntraining within the final due date are reported to the Compliance red flag team for investigation and may receive a red flag, if\neligible. Management Board members receive ongoing periodic online training about financial crime topics as well as in-person\ntailored training and briefings on topics such as the risks of cryptocurrency.\nDeutsche Bank discloses ESG related reports and events under its Investor Relations website ESG \u2013 Deutsche Bank (*) which\nincludes both certifications and documentations and discloses on AML, Know Your Customer (KYC) and the U.S. Patriot Act\nKYC/AML/Patriot Act \u2013 Deutsche Bank (*).\n88 Deutsche Bank Appendix\nNon-Financial Report 2022 GRI Content Index and UN Global Compact\nGRI Content Index and UN Global Compact\nGRI 1 Foundation in 2021\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Non-Financial Report provides a comprehensive disclosure of the material topics for its non-financial\nperformance.

The entries in the risk maps are labelled accordingly (E, S, G risk map items).\nIn the field of ongoing environmental, social and governance regulation, combined with efforts to im-\nprove economic resilience, there are a number of potential risks for our data, derivatives and index busi-\nness, particularly in view of the current geopolitical tension and economic volatility. If less ambitious\nsustainability policies lead to reduced investment in ESG products and to changes in investor prefer-\nences, then demand for our range of ESG products and services could decline or shift. A proposal for Eu-\nropean legislation to regulate ESG data and ratings providers is also expected in 2023. The latter could\nhave an adverse impact on Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. if the proposal includes a standardi-\nsation of methodologies for ESG ratings, and also affect other business units indirectly, such as our index\nbusiness. In addition, if ESG regulation in the field of sustainability standards and labels is deficient or\ntoo prescriptive, this could cause problems and uncertainty concerning its legal status, as well as a loss\nof market confidence. A decline in confidence in such standards and labels may have an adverse impact\non our ESG products across all business units, while an excessively prescriptive approach could inhibit\ninnovation and growth in the ESG segment of our data, derivatives and index business, as well as in the\nmarket overall.\nIf it is no longer possible to allocate capital efficiently to sustainable investments, or the calibration of\nsustainability policies and ESG regulation is not successful, this could impair the maturity, quality and\nliquidity of the market, the marketability and pricing of products, and risk management. Risks could also\nresult from a lack of interoperability between European ESG regulation and global developments. Busi-\nness risks could also be increased by far-reaching due-diligence obligations in supply and value chains,\nand so represent revenue risks.\nThe Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regularly considers whether to classify Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse AG as a financial holding company. It has currently come to the conclusion that Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nAG is not a financial holding company. Classification as a financial holding company could have an im-\npact on our capital requirements.\nCompliance \u2013 including measures against corruption and bribery\nResponsible business operations imply adherence to laws and regulations; they and are also based on\nthe principle of integrity and ethically irreproachable conduct at all times. We have implemented a com-\npliance management system (CMS) based on regulatory requirements, which aims to prevent miscon-\nduct and avoid liability and reputational risks for the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, its legal representatives, ex-\necutives and staff. Beyond business-related and regulatory compliance requirements, the focus is on\nstrengthening a uniform compliance culture throughout the Group, especially with a view to enhancing\ncompliance awareness.\n79 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCode of business conduct\nOur Group\u2019s code of business conduct summarises the most important aspects with regard to corporate\nethics and compliance as well as appropriate conduct. It is communicated to all employees in the Group\nand is available on the internet and intranet sites. Our code of business conduct summarises our core\nvalues and principles, which are intended to act as support for decision-making and enforce market in-\ntegrity, transparency, efficiency and security. Moreover, Group Compliance provides employees with com-\npliance-relevant information via the corresponding intranet pages, unless this is not possible for particu-\nlar confidentiality reasons. For details regarding the principles of responsible corporate governance, see\nthe section \u201cCorporate governance statement\u201d.\nAs a member of the UN Global Compact we are committed to its principles, notably to support human\nand labour rights, to protect the environment and to work against corruption in all its forms, which in-\ncludes extortion and bribery. These principles are also an integral part of our code of business conduct,\nwhich also prohibits any involvement in corruption or any activities which may lead to the impression\nthat the Group promises, arranges, provides, receives or asks for unlawful benefits. Bribery and facilita-\ntion payments are prohibited.\nObjectivity and integrity are the guiding principles for employees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Our manage-\nment is fully aware of their function as role models and the importance of the meaning \u201ctone from the\ntop\u201d, which makes it possible to draw the attention of every individual employee towards managing\ncompliance risks, both within the Group and among market participants. In order to sustainably anchor\nthese guiding principles, and to prevent the Group and its staff from legal sanctions and reputational\ndamage, Group Compliance has implemented risk-based compliance and preventive measures.\nCompliance management system\nThe compliance management system \u2013 under the responsibility of, and promoted by, the Executive\nBoard of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG \u2013 therefore constitutes an indispensable element of good corporate govern-\nance with respect to compliance. Group Compliance manages the CMS as a second line of defence func-\ntion and ensures compliance with legislation, regulations and internal rules, and promotes best practice\nwithin the Group. In addition, Group Compliance monitors, verifies and implements compliance\nmeasures to mitigate risks with negative impacts (e.g. direct or indirect financial losses, regulatory pen-\nalties or reputational damage). Such a CMS provides the foundation for sustainable risk transparency;\nspecifically, it facilitates the mitigation of compliance risks in the areas of money laundering/terrorism\nfinancing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest and\ninsider trading, as well as monitoring of requirements concerning financial sanctions and embargoes.\n2)\nThe CMS applies to Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and to the subsidiaries in Germany and abroad in which we\nhold a majority interest. Our Group-wide compliance approach is intended to ensure that our Group\ncompanies respect applicable legislation and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe CMS is assessed at least once a year using relevant criteria to ensure it is appropriate and effective,\nand a report is presented to the Audit Committee of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Supervisory Board. The criteria\ninclude i.a. the evaluation of compliance policies and frameworks, risk analyses, controls, training and\nthe regular reporting. In addition, risk-based internal and external audits are performed to validate the\nCMS.\nTo ensure that the CMS is appropriate and effective, and to reflect increasing complexity and growing\nregulatory demands, the CMS is regularly enhanced and improved. Our compliance measures enable us\nto identify, measure and manage compliance risks, particularly in the fields of money-laundering/ terror-\nism financing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest,\ninsider trading, financial sanctions and embargoes.\nWhen determining the focus and improvements of the CMS, we are guided by applicable prudential leg-\nislation and regulatory requirements, as well as by the recommendations of internationally accepted\nstandards. Based on these standards, Group Compliance identifies fields of action and measures to con-\ntinuously adapt the CMS to changing requirements.\nCurrently, Group Compliance is implementing the function of a Human Rights Officer to ensure that the\nrequirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains are met.\nCompliance organisational structure\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Executive Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. Com-\npliance reporting comprises the relevant compliance risks in the context of the compliance mandate, as\nwell as other compliance-relevant information and activities. The Chief Compliance Officers from group\ncompanies that are covered by banking regulation have functional reporting lines to the Group Chief\nCompliance Officer. The same applies to the Chief Compliance Officers of Qontigo, ECC/EEX and 360T.\nISS is regulated by the US Investment Advisers Act and has therefore set up a compliance function in\naccordance with the statutory requirements and designated a Chief Compliance Officer. In view of the\ndecision to manage ISS at arm\u2019s length, however, there is currently no functional reporting line to the\nChief Compliance Officer of the Group. In the course of implementing a group-wide compliance ap-\nproach, the implementation of the compliance group standards is still being pursued at ISS.\nThe Group Compliance Committee is an interdisciplinary committee at management level that aims to\nsupport and advise the respective Executive Boards and Compliance functions within Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nGroup on compliance topics. Committee members are the senior managers of the business units, the\nChief Compliance Officers of group companies and representatives of the relevant control functions.\nGroup Compliance also informs the committee about important compliance topics and incidents, as well\nas potential trends and regulatory developments.\n81 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCompliance measures\nCompliance2)rules\nGroup Compliance sets standards for the key compliance risks affecting all entities within the Group. In\nthis context, Group Compliance devises risk-oriented measures in order to mitigate and manage identi-\nfied risks; communicates about risks and incidents as well as the effectiveness of the measures taken.\nFurther Group Compliance ensures the continuous improvement of the CMS by regular adjustments to\nthe relevant internal policies and processes.\nThe group-wide applicable compliance policies have been implemented to ensure that the internal stake-\nholder groups and employees acting on behalf of the Group implement and follow its rules and require-\nments. In this way, group-wide compliance violations shall be addressed preventively, detectively, and\nsanctionally. Group-wide communications via the intranet are geared towards providing employees (in-\ncluding members of the Executive Board and managers) with the necessary guidance for their daily work\nand ensuring compliance.\nCompliance training\nRegular compliance trainings are a fundamental instrument for promoting the compliance culture and\ncompliance awareness across the Group. Our employees around the world are trained regularly on the\nrelevant compliance topics. Our compliance trainings particularly cover the topics of money-laundering/\nterrorism financing, criminal offences, ethics, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts\nof interest, insider trading, financial sanctions and embargoes. Our management, that is exposed to a\nhigher compliance risk by virtue of their work receive additional training as required. Participation in\nabove mentioned trainings is mandatory for our employees, as well as for management.\nWhistleblowing2)system\nWe support, by lived compliance awareness, an open approach towards managing misconduct. For this\nreason, employees are encouraged to address their concerns directly to the responsible line manager, HR\nor to Group Compliance. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s whistleblowing system (BKMS) offers an additional\nand anonymous channel for reporting potential or confirmed breaches of prudential or regulatory require-\nment and ethical standards. Employees, service providers and third parties can submit reports via tele-\nphone or e-mail. The anonymity of whistleblowers is guaranteed at all times.\nAnalysis of compliance risks\nIn line with regulatory requirements, we carry out risk analyses regularly and, if needed, on an ad hoc\nbasis in order to be able to understand and assess relevant compliance risks and to derive risk mitigating\nmeasures based on the results. Such risk analyses and assessments comprise the Group\u2019s own business\nactivities as well as business relationships, market participants, products and services.\nA Group-wide compliance risk assessment framework was implemented last year to standardise the pro-\ncess of identifying, analysing and assessing compliance risks within the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. The de-\nveloped methodology is to be applied for the first time in 2023.\n82 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nIn the context of the current geopolitical events in Ukraine and the resulting potential economic policy\nconsequences, Group Compliance continues to analyse which risks could have an impact in the individ-\nual business areas and which measures need to be taken and implemented. This concerns all risks for\nGroup companies that have business relationships with companies based in the affected countries\n(Ukraine, Russia), hold assets or have other connections of both an economic and technical nature. The\nGroup has implemented a robust and flexible system to manage any sanctions and embargo risks. Dedi-\ncated sanctions experts monitor current developments carefully and are in regular contact with stake-\nholders and the business areas of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group in order to be able to react to restrictions in\na timely manner.\n\nNumber of justified customer complaints relating to data protection 0 0\n1) All employees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group must repeat the web-based ABC training every two years. Since the update and completion of the training takes place in\nodd years, the number of completed trainings in the even year 2022 is significantly lower.\nRegulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\nClearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG, in their capacity as credit\ninstitutions, are subject to solvency supervision by the German or Luxembourg banking supervisory au-\nthorities (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin, and Commission de Surveillance du\nSecteur Financier, CSSF, respectively). The same applies to the Clearstream Holding at a regulatory\ngroup level. Eurex Repo GmbH and 360 Treasury Systems AG are also subject to specific provisions ap-\nplicable to investment firms.\nNodal Clear, LLC is a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) subject to regulation by the US Commod-\nity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nCrypto Finance (Brokerage) AG is authorised as securities firm according to Article 41 of the Swiss Fed-\neral Act on Financial Institutions (FinIA) while Crypto Finance (Asset Management) AG is authorised as\nmanager of collective investments according to the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA).\nBoth are subject to the supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).\nMarket risk exposure only results from relatively small open foreign currency positions.\nThe following table shows the regulatory own funds requirements per risk category which are derived\nfrom the risk exposure amount with a capital ratio of 8%.\n\n1) Clearstream Banking AG\u2019s previous year\u2019s figures were updated based on the previous-year\u2019s audited financial statements.\nNo capital contributions were made in 2022, but they are planned for the years ahead in order to\nstrengthen the capital base. In February 2023, Clearstream Banking AG carried out a capital injection of\n\u20ac30.0 million. The reason for the strengthening of the capital base is primarily a change in the interpre-\ntation of capital requirements by the supervisory authorities.\nRegulatory capital ratios according to CRR\n\n1) Clearstream Banking AG\u2019s previous year\u2019s figures were updated based on the previous-year\u2019s audited financial statements.\n2) According to Art. 26 Abs. 1 (a) CRR, capitel insturments must comply with the requirements pursuant to Art. 28 CRR. As of 31 December 2021, the profit and loss\ntransfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art. 28 (3) (d) CRR. Therefore, the regulatory own funds\nwere reduced subsequently as per 31 December 2021 to the amount of subscribed capital of \u20ac25.0 million. Furthermore, previous year\u2019s own funds requirements were\nadjusted.\nClearstream Banking AG\u2019s capital requirements according to CSDR are currently significantly above CRR\nand CRD IV capital requirements. The capital requirements under Article 47 CSDR do not stipulate a\nspecific ratio. Instead, the total of share capital and reserves is compared with the capital requirements\nand has to be at least the same.\n84 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCapital adequacy requirements under CSDR\n\n\n1) As the annual financial statements of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group are published prior to the finalization of Clearstream Banking S.A.'s and Clear-\nstream Banking AG's approved annual financial statements, the calculation of the other CSDR capital requirements have been based on the previous year\u2019s ap-\nproved annual financial statements.\nCapital adequacy requirements under EMIR\nEuropean Commodity Clearing\n\n1) Previous year adjusted\nThe Investment Firm Regulation requires 360 Treasury Systems AG as an investment firm of category 2\nto hold own funds of the higher of a) 25 per cent of the fixed overheads, b) a fixed minimum initial capi-\ntal requirement of the entity or c) the capital requirements calculated based on the K factors. Eurex Repo\nGmbH determines its own funds requirements according to its classification as small and non-intercon-\nnected investment firm based on the higher of a) or b) as described above. The capital requirement for\n360T and also for the Eurex Repo currently corresponds to 25 per cent of the respective fixed overheads\nof the previous year.\nComposition of own funds/capital requirements\n\n1) According to Art. 26 Abs. 1 (a) CRR, capital instruments must comply with the requirements pursuant to Art. 28 CRR. As of 31 December 2021, the profit and loss\ntransfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art. 28 (3) (d) CRR. Therefore, the regulatory own funds\nwere reduced subsequently as per 31 December 2021 to the amount of subscribed capital of \u20ac25.0 million. Furthermore, previous year\u2019s own funds requirements were\nadjusted.\nCompliance with own funds requirements\n\nThe regulatory minimum requirements were complied with at all times by all companies during the re-\nporting period and in the period up to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.2)2)\n86 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nOverall assessment of the risk situation by the Executive Board\nSummary\nThe risk profile of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group did not change significantly in the 2022 financial year. All\nknown impacts of the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments were actively managed within the\nGroup and potential new risks were analysed on an ongoing basis. The aggregate total risk of Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse Group comprising of all risk types (operational, financial, pension and business risk) was always\nmatched by sufficient covered funds. As of 31 December 2022, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s required eco-\nnomic capital (REC) amounted to \u20ac1,754 million, an almost 4 per cent decline year on year (31 De-\ncember 2021: \u20ac1,827 million, measured with a 99.9 per cent confidence level). It is covered by a risk-\nbearing capacity of \u20ac7,742 million.\nNo significant change in the risk situation of the Group is foreseeable for the Executive Board at the pre-\nsent time.\nOutlook\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group continually assesses its risk situation. Based on the calculated REC in stress tests\nand based on the risk management system, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board concludes that the\navailable risk cover amount and the available liquidity are sufficient. There is currently no indication that\nthe risk coverage amount has to be adjusted for 2023. Furthermore, it cannot identify any risk that\nwould endanger the Group\u2019s existence as a going concern.\nIn 2023 we intend to continue strengthening and expanding its risk management and internal control\nsystem (ICS). This includes, for example, the expansion of information security management, ongoing\nmethodological improvements in risk management and the ICS, and a closer coordination between con-\ntrol functions, also by means of a Groupwide governance, risk and compliance tool.\n87 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nIn addition, on 9 February 2023, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud to en-\nhance, economize and concentrate Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s cloud adoption. Google Cloud will become\nour preferred partner for the next ten years and help to further enhance the group\u2019s cloud adoption and\nefficiency. Specifically, we will leverage Google Cloud\u2019s secure infrastructure and leading data and analyt-\nics capabilities to accelerate the development of our digital securities platform D7, innovate our digital\nasset market operations, and enhance our data distribution and data use cases in the cloud.\nAs already stated, distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents another technological opportunity. It is\nconsidered a disruptive technology at times \u2013 but at present, the financial services sector is increasingly\nexploring its opportunities. Thanks to its decentralised nature, it facilitates direct interaction between par-\nticipants, thus offering the potential for simplifying complex processes. Established market infrastructure\nproviders such as Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, which covers the entire value creation chain from a single\nsource, play an important role when it comes to tapping this potential \u2013 meeting existing industry stand-\nards at the same time. Besides legal and regulatory requirements, this also involves adhering to security\nstandards, as well as limiting risks and ensuring cost efficiency. This enables, e.g., the development of\ndigital issuance of financial products via the D7 platform which shortens the extensive and multi-day is-\nsuance process to just a few minutes. The enhancement of D7 platform with decentral capabilities, in\nline with the respective regulations and market interest, could complement the offer in further jurisdic-\ntions. Like this, the central securities depository is creating a fully digital alternative to conventional se-\ncurities issuance. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) is the first issuer to have launched a digital fixed-\nincome bond in the form of central register security based on the German Electronic Securities Act\n(eWpG) in December 2022.\nM&A growth opportunities2)\nInorganic growth is an equally important part of Compass 2023. We focus on areas that are closely re-\nlated to our strategic growth areas, which include the data, index and analytics business, ESG, commod-\nities, forex trading, fixed income trading and investment fund services. The aim is to accelerate growth in\nthese areas by means of mergers and acquisitions and make our businesses even more scalable.\n11. Report on expected developments\nThe forecast describes our expected performance in the 2023 financial year. It contains statements and\ninformation on events in the future and is based on the company\u2019s expectations and assumptions at the\ntime of publication of this corporate report. In turn, these are subject to known and unknown opportuni-\nties, risks and uncertainties. Numerous factors, many of which are outside the company\u2019s control, influ-\nence the Group\u2019s success, its business strategy and its financial results. Should opportunities, risks or\nuncertainties materialise, or should one of the assumptions made turn out to be incorrect, the Group\u2019s\nactual performance could deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations and assumptions\ncontained in the forward-looking statements and information contained in this report on expected devel-\nopments.\n91 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopments in the operating environment\nMacroeconomic environment\nEconomic growth slowed significantly over the course of 2022. This was due partly to the macroeco-\nnomic effects of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. High inflation rates and risks to energy sup-\nplies also played a role. In the forecast period we expect a further deterioration in the conditions for eco-\nnomic growth. An end to the war in Ukraine, a sustainable solution for energy supplies or looser\nmonetary policy by central banks as a result of lower inflation rates could have a positive impact on fu-\nture economic performance, however.\nFuture development of results of operations\nGiven our diversified business model and multiple sources of revenue, and despite the tense macroeco-\nnomic environment, we believe we are very well positioned to further improve our earnings in the me-\ndium and long term. This expectation is based partly on the secular growth opportunities that we intend\nto exploit (for details, see the \u201cReport on opportunities\u201d), as well as on additional forecast inorganic\ngrowth.\nIn line with our strategy, we assume that net revenue will increase by at least 5 per cent in the forecast\nperiod on the basis of secular growth opportunities. We are driving this growth through investment. By\ndoing so, we aim to shift further market share from over-the-counter trading and clearing to the on-ex-\nchange segment and to further expand our positions in existing asset classes by introducing new prod-\nucts and functionalities and acquiring new customers. Thanks to the very good cyclical performance in\n2022, higher market volatility and rising interest rates, we assume that the cyclical net revenue contri-\nbution will either be only slightly positive or even negative in the forecast period. This depends largely on\nfuture changes in market volatility and interest rates, particularly with regard to net interest income from\nbanking business. In total, we therefore anticipate net revenue in the \u20ac4.5\u20134.7 billion range for the fore-\ncast period.\nWithin the context of our growth strategy, we pursue clearly defined principles for managing operating\ncosts. We achieve the necessary flexibility largely by making continuous improvements to our operating\nprocesses. This enables us to manage operating costs partly in line with net revenue growth. In the fore-\ncast period, we expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to increase\nto \u20ac2.6\u20132.8 billion.\nForecast for results of operations 2023\nBasis 2022 Forecast 2023\n\u20acm \u20acbn\nNet revenue 4,337.6 4.5\u20134.7\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 2,525.6 2.6\u20132.8\n92 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopment of non-financial performance indicators\nInitiatives to promote the transparency and security of the markets will continue to be a key focus during\nthe forecast period, ensuring that we add value for society. As far as the forecast development of non-\nfinancial performance indicators for 2023 is concerned, system availability (customer facing IT) was\nbrought back into line with the high targets by means of additional back-up measures, which became\npart of everyday operations. We therefore expect that the system availability (customer facing IT) will re-\nmain high in the forecast period.\nBeing an attractive employer is important for our sustained success. We want to attract top talents and\nretain them for the long term. The measures described in the chapter \u201cOur employees\u201d put us in a good\nposition and we are confident that we can maintain or improve on our employee satisfaction of more\nthan 71.5 per cent.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board has defined target quotas for women on the two management lev-\nels beneath the Executive Board, in accordance with section 76 (4) of the AktG, in each case referring to\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG. By 31 December 2023, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and\nsecond management levels beneath the Executive Board is planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per\ncent, respectively.\nMoreover, on a global group level the Executive Board adopted a voluntary commitment to increase the\nshare of women holding upper management positions to 23 per cent by the end of 2023, and of women\nholding lower management positions to 33 per cent during the same period. We have extended the\nscope of our voluntary commitment over and above the legal requirements.\nThe assessment of independent ESG rating agencies is an important benchmark for our ESG efforts. We\ncontinuously analyse our performance and take action accordingly. Over the forecast period we expect\nthat we will be able to maintain our good position above the 90th percentile of the ESG ratings.\nTargets for non-financial key performance indicators 2023\nBasis 2022 Target 2023\nSystem availability (customer facing IT) >99.9% >99.5%\nEmployee satisfaction 73% >71.5%\nWomen in leadership positions1 23% >23%\nESG ratings 98th percentile >90th percentile\n1) Group-wide target in senior management\n93 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on post-balance sheet date events\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopment of the financial position\nWe expect that cash flow from operating activities, which is our primary source of financing, will remain\nsignificantly positive in future. We expect that two significant factors will influence changes in liquidity:\nFirstly, we plan to invest around \u20ac300 million in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at\nGroup level. These investments will serve primarily to develop new products and services in our growth\nareas and to enhance existing ones. Secondly, we will propose a dividend of \u20ac3.60 per share to the An-\nnual General Meeting to be held in May 2023. This would represent a cash outflow of about\n\u20ac661,6 million. Apart from the above, we did not expect any other material factors to impact the\nGroup\u2019s liquidity at the time the combined management report was prepared. As in previous years, we\nassume that we will have a sound liquidity base in the forecast period due to positive cash flow from op-\nerating activities, adequate credit lines (for details see \u201cnote 25 to the consolidated financial state-\nments\u201d), and our flexible management and planning systems.\nWe generally aim to distribute dividends equivalent to between 40 and 60 per cent of net profit for the\nperiod attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. Within this range, we manage the actual\ndistribution ratio mainly in relation to our business performance and based on continuity considerations.\nIn addition, we plan to invest the remaining available funds primarily in the continued inorganic develop-\nment of the Group. Should we be unable to invest these funds, additional distributions, particularly\nshare buy-backs, represent another opportunity for the use of funds. To maintain its strong credit ratings\nat Group level, we aim for a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of no more than 1.75, and a ratio of free funds\nfrom operations to net debt of at least 50 per cent.\nOverall assessment by the Executive Board\nWe believe the Group remains very well positioned in terms of international competition, thanks to its\nbroadly diversified offering along the securities trading value chain and its innovative strength. This being\nthe case, we expect to see a positive trend in our results of operations over the long term. Measures\ntaken as part of our growth strategy should further accelerate this growth. In this context, we aim to be-\ncome more agile and effective and sharpen our client focus, in order to become the global market infra-\nstructure provider of choice, with a top ranking in all our business areas. We endeavour to expand our\nstructural growth areas further, and to increase their contribution to net revenue again by at least 5 per\ncent. Taking cyclical effects into account, we are planning an increase in net revenue to \u20ac4.5\u20134.7 billion\nin the forecast period. We expect EBITDA to go up to \u20ac2.6\u20132.8 billion in the forecast period. Overall, on\nthis basis we assume that cash flow from operating activities will be clearly positive and that, as in pre-\nvious years, the liquidity base will be sound.

Corporate governance statement\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group attaches great importance to the principles of good corporate governance and\ncontrol. In this statement, we report on corporate governance at Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in accordance with\nprinciple 23 of the Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex (the \u201cCode\u201d, German Corporate Governance\nCode). The statement contains the corporate governance statement pursuant to section 315d in conjunc-\ntion with section 289f of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, German Commercial Code).\nDeclaration of Conformity pursuant to section 161 Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation\nAct)\nOn 7 December 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG issued the fol-\nlowing Declaration of Conformity:\n\u201cDeclaration by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG regarding the Ger-\nman Corporate Governance Code in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\nAll recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the current version dated 28\nApril 2022, which was published in the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022, are currently complied with\nand shall continue to be complied with in the future.\nSince the last declaration of conformity was issued on 8 December 2021, all recommendations of the\nGCGC in the version dated 16 December 2019, which was published in the Federal Gazette on 20\nMarch 2020, have also been complied with.\nThe annual declaration of conformity pursuant to section 161 of the AktG can also be found online at\nwww.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Declaration of Conformity.\nThe declarations of conformity for the past five years are also available there.\nDisclosures on overriding statutory provisions\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG declare in accordance with recom-\nmendation F.4 GCGC that recommendation D.4 GCGC was not applicable to the company in 2022 be-\ncause of the overriding statutory requirement of section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange Act. Recom-\nmendation D.4 GCGC states that the Supervisory Board shall form a Nomination Committee composed\nexclusively of shareholder representatives. In accordance with section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange\nAct, however, the Nomination Committee also assists the Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in\nselecting candidates for the Executive Board. As this task shall not be performed exclusively by share-\nholder representatives of the Supervisory Board, and in line with the practice to date, the Nomination\nCommittee also includes employee representatives.\nDisclosures on suggestions of the Code\nThe GCGC consists of both recommendations (denoted in the text by the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d), which\nare reported in the Declaration of Conformity in accordance with section 161 of the AktG, and sugges-\ntions (denoted in the text by the use of the word \u201cshould\u201d).

Specifically, the main objectives of these princi-\nples for collaboration are to ensure responsibility, respect and mutual esteem. The Group also adheres to\nthese principles when implementing its business model. Communications with clients, investors, em-\nployees and the general public are based on timely information and transparency. In addition to focusing\non generating profit, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s business is managed sustainably in accordance with recog-\nnised legal, social and ethical standards.\nCode of business conduct\nActing responsibly means having values that are shared by all employees throughout the Group.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG therefore has a code of business conduct that is reviewed every year. This docu-\nment, which is adopted by the Executive Board and applies throughout the Group, defines the founda-\ntions of key ethical and legal standards, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the following topics:\n3) Compliance with legislation and regulations; whistleblowing\n3) Confidentiality and the handling of sensitive information\n3) Conflicts of interest\n3) Prevention of insider trading and market manipulation; personal account dealings\n3) Prevention of corruption\n3) Risk management\n3) Environmental awareness\n3) Equal opportunities and protection against undesirable behaviour\n3) Corporate responsibility; human rights; ethical conduct\nThe code of business conduct applies to members of the Executive Board, all other executives and all\nemployees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. In addition to specifying concrete rules, the code of business con-\nduct provides general guidance as to how employees can contribute to implementing the defined values\nin their everyday working life. The goal of the code of business conduct is to provide guidance on work-\ning together in the company on a day-to-day basis, to help resolve any conflicts and to resolve ethical\nand legal challenges. All newly hired employees receive the code of business conduct as part of their\nemployment contract documentation. The code of business conduct is an integral part of the relationship\nbetween employer and employees at Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Breaches may lead to disciplinary action.\nThe document is available at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibility > Sustainability > Our em-\nployees > Guiding principles.\nCode of conduct for suppliers\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group not only requires its management and staff to adhere to high standards \u2013 it de-\nmands the same from its suppliers and service providers.

A key way in which we underscore the values we\nconsider important for the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group is by joining initiatives and organisations that advocate\ngenerally accepted ethical standards. Relevant memberships are as follows:\nUnited Nations Global Compact www.unglobalcompact.org: this voluntary business initiative estab-\nlished by the United Nations aims to achieve a more sustainable and more equitable global economy. At\nthe heart of the compact are ten principles covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment pro-\ntection and anti-corruption. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group has submitted annual communications on progress\n(COPs) on its implementation of the UN Global Compact since 2009.\nDiversity Charter www.charta-der-vielfalt.de: as a signatory to the Diversity Charter, the company has\ncommitted to acknowledging, respecting and promoting the diversity of its workforce, customers and\nbusiness associates \u2013 irrespective of their age, gender, disability, race, religion, nationality, ethnic back-\nground, sexual orientation or identity.\nInternational Labour Organization www.ilo.org: this UN agency is the international organisation re-\nsponsible for drawing up and overseeing international labour standards; it brings together representatives\nof governments, employees and employers to promote the joint development of policies and pro-\ngrammes. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group has signed up to the ILO\u2019s labour standards and hence has agreed to\nabide by them.\nSustainability in corporate governance\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It is there-\nfore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Super-\nvisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sus-\ntainability matters at Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It is supported by the cross-functional Group Sustainability\nBoard, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board\nfor sustainability topics in the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to envi-\nronmental, social and governance topics (ESG). One of the Group Sustainability Board\u2019s particular re-\nsponsibilities is to ensure that sustainability is incorporated into the company strategy. This includes ad-\nvising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The\nGroup ESG Strategy team, which reports to the CEO, provides support by coordinating overarching ESG\nproduct initiatives, managing the ESG reporting and continuously monitoring the ESG profile and climate\nstrategy of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group.\nAt the level of the Supervisory Board the responsibilities of the former Strategy Committee were ex-\npanded in 2021 to reflect the strategic importance of sustainability and it was renamed the Strategy and\nSustainability Committee. In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this\nway, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees,\nespecially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant\nsustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n97 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nTo promote the sustainable development of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, ESG targets are an integral part\nof the remuneration system for the Executive Board. Details of the Executive Board remuneration system\ncan be found in the \u201cRemuneration report\u201d.\nFurther information on this subject can be found online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibil-\nity > Sustainability. More information about the Supervisory Board committee Strategy and Sustainability\ncan be found in the chapter \u201cSupervisory Board committees\u201d. Details of the work carried out by the\nStrategy and Sustainability Committee are included in the \u201cSupervisory Board Report\u201d.\nSector-specific policies\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s pivotal role in the financial sector requires that it handles information \u2013 and es-\npecially sensitive data and facts \u2013 responsibly. A number of rules are in force throughout the Group to\nensure that employees comply with this. They comprise both statutory and internal rules that can be\nadapted specifically to individual industry segments. They include policies on whistleblowing, risk man-\nagement and the internal control system.\nWhistleblowing system\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group plays an active role in the fight against breaches of rules and regulations. One\nexample is Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s whistleblowing system, which provides a channel to report non-\ncompliant behaviour. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group uses the Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS\u00ae), an\nonline application that enables employees, clients and third parties to report matters that could be crimi-\nnal offences and incidents of non-compliance by employees or third parties concerning the business of\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Reports can be made in their own name or anonymously and can be made\naround the clock.\nFurther information regarding the whistleblowing system can be found at www.deutsche-boerse.com >\nOur Company > Contact > Whistleblower system.\nRisk and control management policies and principles\nFunctioning control systems are an important part of stable and sustainable business processes.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s enterprise-wide control systems are embedded in an overarching framework.\nThis comprises, among other things, the legal requirements, the recommendations of the German Corpo-\nrate Governance Code, international regulations and recommendations and other company-specific poli-\ncies. The executives responsible for the different elements of the control system are in close contact with\neach other and with the Executive Board. Key aspects of its design and implementation are also reported\nregularly to the Supervisory Board or its committees. Equally, the Group has an enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement system that covers and provides mandatory rules for functions, processes and responsibili-\nties. The internal control system and risk management system also cover sustainability-related targets.\nDetails of the internal control system and risk management at the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group can be found in\nthe \u201cRisk management\u201d section.\nFrom its examination of the internal control and risk management system and the reports of the Internal\nAudit function regarding its risk-oriented and process-independent controls conducted, the Executive\nBoard does not have any indications which would result in reservations regarding the appropriateness\nand efficacy of the systems.\n98 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nWorking practices of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\nAn important fundamental principle of the German Stock Corporation Act is the dual board system \u2013\nwhich assigns separate, independent responsibilities to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.\nThese responsibilities and their implementation at Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG are set out in detail in the follow-\ning paragraphs.\nBoth boards perform their duties in the interests of the company and with the aim of achieving a sus-\ntainable, long-term increase in value. Their actions are based on the principle of responsible corporate\ngovernance. Therefore, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board and Supervisory Board work closely to-\ngether in a spirit of mutual trust, with the Executive Board providing the Supervisory Board with compre-\nhensive information on the company\u2019s and the Group\u2019s position and the course of business in a regular\nand timely manner. In addition, the Executive Board regularly informs the Supervisory Board concerning\nissues relating to corporate planning, the risk situation and risk management, compliance and the com-\npany\u2019s control systems. The strategic orientation of the company is examined in detail and agreed upon\nwith the Supervisory Board. Implementation of the relevant measures is discussed at regular intervals.\nThe Chief Executive Officer reports to the Supervisory Board without undue delay, orally or in writing, on\nmatters that are of special importance to the company.\nIn addition, the CEO keeps the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed of the\ncurrent developments affecting the company\u2019s business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions\nand the long-term outlook and discusses these issues with him or her. The Supervisory Board may also\nrequest reports from the Executive Board at any time, especially on matters and business transactions at\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG and subsidiaries that have a significant impact on Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s position. The\nRules of Procedures for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board contain provisions on the corre-\nsponding information rights and obligations of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board exceeding\nstatutory regulations.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board\nThe Executive Board manages Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group; it had six members dur-\ning the reporting period. The main duties of the Executive Board include defining the Group\u2019s corporate\ngoals and sustainable strategic orientation, managing and monitoring the operating units, as well as es-\ntablishing and monitoring an efficient risk management system. The Executive Board is responsible for\npreparing the annual and consolidated financial statements of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, as well as for produc-\ning financial information during the course of the year. In addition, it must ensure the company\u2019s compli-\nance with legal requirements and official regulations.\nThe members of the Executive Board are jointly responsible for all aspects of management. Irrespective\nof this collective responsibility, the individual members manage the company\u2019s business areas assigned\nto them in the Executive Board\u2019s schedule of responsibilities independently and are personally responsi-\nble for them. In addition to the business areas, the functional areas of responsibility are that of the Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Information Officer/Chief Operating\nOfficer (CIO/COO) and Governance, People & Culture. The business areas cover the operating business\nunits, such as the company\u2019s cash market activities, the derivatives business, securities settlement and\ncustody, fund distribution services as well as the market data, financial and sustainability information\nbusiness.

Among other things, these list issues that are reserved for the entire Ex-\necutive Board, special measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board, other procedural de-\ntails and the arrangements for passing resolutions. The Executive Board holds regular meetings; these\nare convened by the CEO, who coordinates the Executive Board\u2019s work. Any Executive Board member\ncan require a meeting to be convened. In accordance with its bylaws, the entire Executive Board nor-\nmally takes decisions on the basis of resolutions passed by a simple majority of the members voting on\nthem in each case. If a vote is tied, the CEO has the casting vote.\nMore information on the Executive Board, its composition, members\u2019 individual appointments and biog-\nraphies can be found at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Ex-\necutive Board.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Supervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in its management of the company.\nThis also covers sustainability matters. The Supervisory Board supports the Executive Board in signifi-\ncant business decisions and provides assistance on strategically important issues. In the Rules of Proce-\ndures for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has defined transactions of fundamental im-\nportance which require its approval. In addition, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the\nmembers of the Executive Board, deciding on their total remuneration and examining Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nAG\u2019s annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report. Details of the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s work during the 2022 financial year can be found in the \u201cReport of the Supervisory\nBoard\u201d.\nThe Supervisory Board consists of 16 members, made up of an equal number of shareholder representa-\ntives and employee representatives in line with the German Mitbestimmungsgesetz (MitbestG, German\nCo-determination Act). The term of office of the current members ends at the Annual General Meeting in\n2024. This also applies to an employee representative who was appointed by the court to the Supervi-\nsory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in 2022 after the early voluntary retirement of another employee rep-\nresentative.\nThe Supervisory Board holds at least six regular meetings every year. In addition, extraordinary meetings\nare held as required. Executive Board members attend the meetings unless the Supervisory Board de-\ncides otherwise in any particular case. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Executive\nBoard. Exchanges also take place as necessary with the annual auditors. The committees also hold reg-\nular meetings. Unless mandatory statutory provisions or the Articles of Associations call for a different\nprocedure, the Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by a simple majority. If a vote is tied, the Chair\nhas the casting vote. The work of the Supervisory Board and its Committees is defined by the Rules of\nProcedure for the Supervisory Board, which is available under www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Re-\nlations > Corporate Governance > Supervisory Board > Rules of procedure.\n100 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the knowledge, skill and experience of the Executive Board and Supervi-\nsory Board and their members regularly, at least once a year, and examines the structure, size, composi-\ntion and performance of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Its review is based on a catalogue\nof specific targets, including qualification requirements, which, in turn, are reviewed regularly by the Su-\npervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also regularly, at least once a year, reviews the effectiveness of\nits work, discusses opportunities for improvement and decides on suitable measures if necessary. The\nconcrete targets are described in the chapter \u201cTargets for composition and qualification requirements of\nthe Supervisory Board\u201d and the annual effectiveness test is described in the chapter \u201cExamination of the\neffectiveness of Supervisory Board work\u201d.\nThe Chair of the Supervisory Board Chair is in regular contact with the representatives of shareholders\nand employees on the Supervisory Board, in addition to the scheduled meetings, and arranges talks to\nprepare for the Supervisory Board meetings as necessary.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s goal in establishing committees is to improve the effectiveness of its work by\nexamining complex matters in smaller groups that prepare them for the plenary meeting of the Supervi-\nsory Board. Additionally, the Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the\ncommittees, to the extent that this is legally permissible. The Supervisory Board had seven committees\nin the reporting period. The responsibilities of the existing Strategy Committee were expanded in 2021 to\nform a Strategy and Sustainability Committee. For details of the committees, please refer to the tables\n\u201cSupervisory Board committees in the reporting year: composition and responsibilities\u201d.

Information on the Supervisory Board\u2019s concrete work and meetings during the\nreporting period can be found in the \u201cReport of the Supervisory Board\u201d.\nMore information on the Supervisory Board and its committees, the individual members and their ap-\npointments and biographies, can be found at: www.deutsche-boerse.com > Corporate Governance >\nInvestor Relations > Supervisory Board.\n101 \n\nTargets for composition and qualification requirements of the Supervisory Board\nIn accordance with recommendation C.1 GCGC, the Supervisory Board has adopted a catalogue of spe-\ncific targets concerning its composition that should serve, above all, as a basis for the nomination of fu-\nture members. The targets include qualification requirements as well as diversity targets. Furthermore,\nmembers shall have sufficient time, as well as the personal integrity and suitability of character, to exer-\ncise their office. In addition, more than half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\nshall be independent. The targets, including the qualification requirements, are reviewed by the Supervi-\nsory Board regularly, at least annually, and modified as necessary. The status of implementation can be\nseen in the qualification matrix at the end of this statement.\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, ex-\npanded the specific targets in the qualification requirements explained below to include expertise in sus-\ntainability matters, and moreover adapted them to changes in statutory and regulatory requirements. The\nSupervisory Board, supported by the Nomination Committee, also examined the targets for the overall\nboard and for the individual members and confirmed that they had been met.\n105 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

The entries in the risk maps are labelled accordingly (E, S, G risk map items).\nIn the field of ongoing environmental, social and governance regulation, combined with efforts to im-\nprove economic resilience, there are a number of potential risks for our data, derivatives and index busi-\nness, particularly in view of the current geopolitical tension and economic volatility. If less ambitious\nsustainability policies lead to reduced investment in ESG products and to changes in investor prefer-\nences, then demand for our range of ESG products and services could decline or shift. A proposal for Eu-\nropean legislation to regulate ESG data and ratings providers is also expected in 2023. The latter could\nhave an adverse impact on Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. if the proposal includes a standardi-\nsation of methodologies for ESG ratings, and also affect other business units indirectly, such as our index\nbusiness. In addition, if ESG regulation in the field of sustainability standards and labels is deficient or\ntoo prescriptive, this could cause problems and uncertainty concerning its legal status, as well as a loss\nof market confidence. A decline in confidence in such standards and labels may have an adverse impact\non our ESG products across all business units, while an excessively prescriptive approach could inhibit\ninnovation and growth in the ESG segment of our data, derivatives and index business, as well as in the\nmarket overall.\nIf it is no longer possible to allocate capital efficiently to sustainable investments, or the calibration of\nsustainability policies and ESG regulation is not successful, this could impair the maturity, quality and\nliquidity of the market, the marketability and pricing of products, and risk management. Risks could also\nresult from a lack of interoperability between European ESG regulation and global developments. Busi-\nness risks could also be increased by far-reaching due-diligence obligations in supply and value chains,\nand so represent revenue risks.\nThe Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regularly considers whether to classify Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse AG as a financial holding company. It has currently come to the conclusion that Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nAG is not a financial holding company. Classification as a financial holding company could have an im-\npact on our capital requirements.\nCompliance \u2013 including measures against corruption and bribery\nResponsible business operations imply adherence to laws and regulations; they and are also based on\nthe principle of integrity and ethically irreproachable conduct at all times. We have implemented a com-\npliance management system (CMS) based on regulatory requirements, which aims to prevent miscon-\nduct and avoid liability and reputational risks for the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, its legal representatives, ex-\necutives and staff. Beyond business-related and regulatory compliance requirements, the focus is on\nstrengthening a uniform compliance culture throughout the Group, especially with a view to enhancing\ncompliance awareness.\n79 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCode of business conduct\nOur Group\u2019s code of business conduct summarises the most important aspects with regard to corporate\nethics and compliance as well as appropriate conduct. It is communicated to all employees in the Group\nand is available on the internet and intranet sites. Our code of business conduct summarises our core\nvalues and principles, which are intended to act as support for decision-making and enforce market in-\ntegrity, transparency, efficiency and security. Moreover, Group Compliance provides employees with com-\npliance-relevant information via the corresponding intranet pages, unless this is not possible for particu-\nlar confidentiality reasons. For details regarding the principles of responsible corporate governance, see\nthe section \u201cCorporate governance statement\u201d.\nAs a member of the UN Global Compact we are committed to its principles, notably to support human\nand labour rights, to protect the environment and to work against corruption in all its forms, which in-\ncludes extortion and bribery. These principles are also an integral part of our code of business conduct,\nwhich also prohibits any involvement in corruption or any activities which may lead to the impression\nthat the Group promises, arranges, provides, receives or asks for unlawful benefits. Bribery and facilita-\ntion payments are prohibited.\nObjectivity and integrity are the guiding principles for employees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Our manage-\nment is fully aware of their function as role models and the importance of the meaning \u201ctone from the\ntop\u201d, which makes it possible to draw the attention of every individual employee towards managing\ncompliance risks, both within the Group and among market participants. In order to sustainably anchor\nthese guiding principles, and to prevent the Group and its staff from legal sanctions and reputational\ndamage, Group Compliance has implemented risk-based compliance and preventive measures.\nCompliance management system\nThe compliance management system \u2013 under the responsibility of, and promoted by, the Executive\nBoard of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG \u2013 therefore constitutes an indispensable element of good corporate govern-\nance with respect to compliance. Group Compliance manages the CMS as a second line of defence func-\ntion and ensures compliance with legislation, regulations and internal rules, and promotes best practice\nwithin the Group. In addition, Group Compliance monitors, verifies and implements compliance\nmeasures to mitigate risks with negative impacts (e.g. direct or indirect financial losses, regulatory pen-\nalties or reputational damage). Such a CMS provides the foundation for sustainable risk transparency;\nspecifically, it facilitates the mitigation of compliance risks in the areas of money laundering/terrorism\nfinancing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest and\ninsider trading, as well as monitoring of requirements concerning financial sanctions and embargoes.\n2)\nThe CMS applies to Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and to the subsidiaries in Germany and abroad in which we\nhold a majority interest. Our Group-wide compliance approach is intended to ensure that our Group\ncompanies respect applicable legislation and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe CMS is assessed at least once a year using relevant criteria to ensure it is appropriate and effective,\nand a report is presented to the Audit Committee of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Supervisory Board. The criteria\ninclude i.a. the evaluation of compliance policies and frameworks, risk analyses, controls, training and\nthe regular reporting. In addition, risk-based internal and external audits are performed to validate the\nCMS.\nTo ensure that the CMS is appropriate and effective, and to reflect increasing complexity and growing\nregulatory demands, the CMS is regularly enhanced and improved. Our compliance measures enable us\nto identify, measure and manage compliance risks, particularly in the fields of money-laundering/ terror-\nism financing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest,\ninsider trading, financial sanctions and embargoes.\nWhen determining the focus and improvements of the CMS, we are guided by applicable prudential leg-\nislation and regulatory requirements, as well as by the recommendations of internationally accepted\nstandards. Based on these standards, Group Compliance identifies fields of action and measures to con-\ntinuously adapt the CMS to changing requirements.\nCurrently, Group Compliance is implementing the function of a Human Rights Officer to ensure that the\nrequirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains are met.\nCompliance organisational structure\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Executive Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. Com-\npliance reporting comprises the relevant compliance risks in the context of the compliance mandate, as\nwell as other compliance-relevant information and activities. The Chief Compliance Officers from group\ncompanies that are covered by banking regulation have functional reporting lines to the Group Chief\nCompliance Officer. The same applies to the Chief Compliance Officers of Qontigo, ECC/EEX and 360T.\nISS is regulated by the US Investment Advisers Act and has therefore set up a compliance function in\naccordance with the statutory requirements and designated a Chief Compliance Officer. In view of the\ndecision to manage ISS at arm\u2019s length, however, there is currently no functional reporting line to the\nChief Compliance Officer of the Group. In the course of implementing a group-wide compliance ap-\nproach, the implementation of the compliance group standards is still being pursued at ISS.\nThe Group Compliance Committee is an interdisciplinary committee at management level that aims to\nsupport and advise the respective Executive Boards and Compliance functions within Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nGroup on compliance topics. Committee members are the senior managers of the business units, the\nChief Compliance Officers of group companies and representatives of the relevant control functions.\nGroup Compliance also informs the committee about important compliance topics and incidents, as well\nas potential trends and regulatory developments.\n81 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCompliance measures\nCompliance2)rules\nGroup Compliance sets standards for the key compliance risks affecting all entities within the Group. In\nthis context, Group Compliance devises risk-oriented measures in order to mitigate and manage identi-\nfied risks; communicates about risks and incidents as well as the effectiveness of the measures taken.\nFurther Group Compliance ensures the continuous improvement of the CMS by regular adjustments to\nthe relevant internal policies and processes.\nThe group-wide applicable compliance policies have been implemented to ensure that the internal stake-\nholder groups and employees acting on behalf of the Group implement and follow its rules and require-\nments. In this way, group-wide compliance violations shall be addressed preventively, detectively, and\nsanctionally. Group-wide communications via the intranet are geared towards providing employees (in-\ncluding members of the Executive Board and managers) with the necessary guidance for their daily work\nand ensuring compliance.\nCompliance training\nRegular compliance trainings are a fundamental instrument for promoting the compliance culture and\ncompliance awareness across the Group. Our employees around the world are trained regularly on the\nrelevant compliance topics. Our compliance trainings particularly cover the topics of money-laundering/\nterrorism financing, criminal offences, ethics, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts\nof interest, insider trading, financial sanctions and embargoes. Our management, that is exposed to a\nhigher compliance risk by virtue of their work receive additional training as required. Participation in\nabove mentioned trainings is mandatory for our employees, as well as for management.\nWhistleblowing2)system\nWe support, by lived compliance awareness, an open approach towards managing misconduct. For this\nreason, employees are encouraged to address their concerns directly to the responsible line manager, HR\nor to Group Compliance. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s whistleblowing system (BKMS) offers an additional\nand anonymous channel for reporting potential or confirmed breaches of prudential or regulatory require-\nment and ethical standards. Employees, service providers and third parties can submit reports via tele-\nphone or e-mail. The anonymity of whistleblowers is guaranteed at all times.\nAnalysis of compliance risks\nIn line with regulatory requirements, we carry out risk analyses regularly and, if needed, on an ad hoc\nbasis in order to be able to understand and assess relevant compliance risks and to derive risk mitigating\nmeasures based on the results. Such risk analyses and assessments comprise the Group\u2019s own business\nactivities as well as business relationships, market participants, products and services.\nA Group-wide compliance risk assessment framework was implemented last year to standardise the pro-\ncess of identifying, analysing and assessing compliance risks within the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. The de-\nveloped methodology is to be applied for the first time in 2023.\n82 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nIn the context of the current geopolitical events in Ukraine and the resulting potential economic policy\nconsequences, Group Compliance continues to analyse which risks could have an impact in the individ-\nual business areas and which measures need to be taken and implemented. This concerns all risks for\nGroup companies that have business relationships with companies based in the affected countries\n(Ukraine, Russia), hold assets or have other connections of both an economic and technical nature. The\nGroup has implemented a robust and flexible system to manage any sanctions and embargo risks. Dedi-\ncated sanctions experts monitor current developments carefully and are in regular contact with stake-\nholders and the business areas of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group in order to be able to react to restrictions in\na timely manner.\n\nNumber of justified customer complaints relating to data protection 0 0\n1) All employees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group must repeat the web-based ABC training every two years. Since the update and completion of the training takes place in\nodd years, the number of completed trainings in the even year 2022 is significantly lower.\nRegulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\nClearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG, in their capacity as credit\ninstitutions, are subject to solvency supervision by the German or Luxembourg banking supervisory au-\nthorities (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin, and Commission de Surveillance du\nSecteur Financier, CSSF, respectively). The same applies to the Clearstream Holding at a regulatory\ngroup level. Eurex Repo GmbH and 360 Treasury Systems AG are also subject to specific provisions ap-\nplicable to investment firms.\nNodal Clear, LLC is a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) subject to regulation by the US Commod-\nity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nCrypto Finance (Brokerage) AG is authorised as securities firm according to Article 41 of the Swiss Fed-\neral Act on Financial Institutions (FinIA) while Crypto Finance (Asset Management) AG is authorised as\nmanager of collective investments according to the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA).\nBoth are subject to the supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).\nMarket risk exposure only results from relatively small open foreign currency positions.\nThe following table shows the regulatory own funds requirements per risk category which are derived\nfrom the risk exposure amount with a capital ratio of 8%.\n\n1) Clearstream Banking AG\u2019s previous year\u2019s figures were updated based on the previous-year\u2019s audited financial statements.\nNo capital contributions were made in 2022, but they are planned for the years ahead in order to\nstrengthen the capital base. In February 2023, Clearstream Banking AG carried out a capital injection of\n\u20ac30.0 million. The reason for the strengthening of the capital base is primarily a change in the interpre-\ntation of capital requirements by the supervisory authorities.\nRegulatory capital ratios according to CRR\n\n1) Clearstream Banking AG\u2019s previous year\u2019s figures were updated based on the previous-year\u2019s audited financial statements.\n2) According to Art. 26 Abs. 1 (a) CRR, capitel insturments must comply with the requirements pursuant to Art. 28 CRR. As of 31 December 2021, the profit and loss\ntransfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art. 28 (3) (d) CRR. Therefore, the regulatory own funds\nwere reduced subsequently as per 31 December 2021 to the amount of subscribed capital of \u20ac25.0 million. Furthermore, previous year\u2019s own funds requirements were\nadjusted.\nClearstream Banking AG\u2019s capital requirements according to CSDR are currently significantly above CRR\nand CRD IV capital requirements. The capital requirements under Article 47 CSDR do not stipulate a\nspecific ratio. Instead, the total of share capital and reserves is compared with the capital requirements\nand has to be at least the same.\n84 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCapital adequacy requirements under CSDR\n\n\n1) As the annual financial statements of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group are published prior to the finalization of Clearstream Banking S.A.'s and Clear-\nstream Banking AG's approved annual financial statements, the calculation of the other CSDR capital requirements have been based on the previous year\u2019s ap-\nproved annual financial statements.\nCapital adequacy requirements under EMIR\nEuropean Commodity Clearing\n\n1) Previous year adjusted\nThe Investment Firm Regulation requires 360 Treasury Systems AG as an investment firm of category 2\nto hold own funds of the higher of a) 25 per cent of the fixed overheads, b) a fixed minimum initial capi-\ntal requirement of the entity or c) the capital requirements calculated based on the K factors. Eurex Repo\nGmbH determines its own funds requirements according to its classification as small and non-intercon-\nnected investment firm based on the higher of a) or b) as described above. The capital requirement for\n360T and also for the Eurex Repo currently corresponds to 25 per cent of the respective fixed overheads\nof the previous year.\nComposition of own funds/capital requirements\n\n1) According to Art. 26 Abs. 1 (a) CRR, capital instruments must comply with the requirements pursuant to Art. 28 CRR. As of 31 December 2021, the profit and loss\ntransfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art. 28 (3) (d) CRR. Therefore, the regulatory own funds\nwere reduced subsequently as per 31 December 2021 to the amount of subscribed capital of \u20ac25.0 million. Furthermore, previous year\u2019s own funds requirements were\nadjusted.\nCompliance with own funds requirements\n\nThe regulatory minimum requirements were complied with at all times by all companies during the re-\nporting period and in the period up to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.2)2)\n86 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nOverall assessment of the risk situation by the Executive Board\nSummary\nThe risk profile of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group did not change significantly in the 2022 financial year. All\nknown impacts of the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments were actively managed within the\nGroup and potential new risks were analysed on an ongoing basis. The aggregate total risk of Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse Group comprising of all risk types (operational, financial, pension and business risk) was always\nmatched by sufficient covered funds. As of 31 December 2022, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s required eco-\nnomic capital (REC) amounted to \u20ac1,754 million, an almost 4 per cent decline year on year (31 De-\ncember 2021: \u20ac1,827 million, measured with a 99.9 per cent confidence level). It is covered by a risk-\nbearing capacity of \u20ac7,742 million.\nNo significant change in the risk situation of the Group is foreseeable for the Executive Board at the pre-\nsent time.\nOutlook\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group continually assesses its risk situation. Based on the calculated REC in stress tests\nand based on the risk management system, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board concludes that the\navailable risk cover amount and the available liquidity are sufficient. There is currently no indication that\nthe risk coverage amount has to be adjusted for 2023. Furthermore, it cannot identify any risk that\nwould endanger the Group\u2019s existence as a going concern.\nIn 2023 we intend to continue strengthening and expanding its risk management and internal control\nsystem (ICS). This includes, for example, the expansion of information security management, ongoing\nmethodological improvements in risk management and the ICS, and a closer coordination between con-\ntrol functions, also by means of a Groupwide governance, risk and compliance tool.\n87 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nIn addition, on 9 February 2023, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud to en-\nhance, economize and concentrate Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s cloud adoption. Google Cloud will become\nour preferred partner for the next ten years and help to further enhance the group\u2019s cloud adoption and\nefficiency. Specifically, we will leverage Google Cloud\u2019s secure infrastructure and leading data and analyt-\nics capabilities to accelerate the development of our digital securities platform D7, innovate our digital\nasset market operations, and enhance our data distribution and data use cases in the cloud.\nAs already stated, distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents another technological opportunity. It is\nconsidered a disruptive technology at times \u2013 but at present, the financial services sector is increasingly\nexploring its opportunities. Thanks to its decentralised nature, it facilitates direct interaction between par-\nticipants, thus offering the potential for simplifying complex processes. Established market infrastructure\nproviders such as Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, which covers the entire value creation chain from a single\nsource, play an important role when it comes to tapping this potential \u2013 meeting existing industry stand-\nards at the same time. Besides legal and regulatory requirements, this also involves adhering to security\nstandards, as well as limiting risks and ensuring cost efficiency. This enables, e.g., the development of\ndigital issuance of financial products via the D7 platform which shortens the extensive and multi-day is-\nsuance process to just a few minutes. The enhancement of D7 platform with decentral capabilities, in\nline with the respective regulations and market interest, could complement the offer in further jurisdic-\ntions. Like this, the central securities depository is creating a fully digital alternative to conventional se-\ncurities issuance. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) is the first issuer to have launched a digital fixed-\nincome bond in the form of central register security based on the German Electronic Securities Act\n(eWpG) in December 2022.\nM&A growth opportunities2)\nInorganic growth is an equally important part of Compass 2023. We focus on areas that are closely re-\nlated to our strategic growth areas, which include the data, index and analytics business, ESG, commod-\nities, forex trading, fixed income trading and investment fund services. The aim is to accelerate growth in\nthese areas by means of mergers and acquisitions and make our businesses even more scalable.\n11. Report on expected developments\nThe forecast describes our expected performance in the 2023 financial year. It contains statements and\ninformation on events in the future and is based on the company\u2019s expectations and assumptions at the\ntime of publication of this corporate report. In turn, these are subject to known and unknown opportuni-\nties, risks and uncertainties. Numerous factors, many of which are outside the company\u2019s control, influ-\nence the Group\u2019s success, its business strategy and its financial results. Should opportunities, risks or\nuncertainties materialise, or should one of the assumptions made turn out to be incorrect, the Group\u2019s\nactual performance could deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations and assumptions\ncontained in the forward-looking statements and information contained in this report on expected devel-\nopments.\n91 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopments in the operating environment\nMacroeconomic environment\nEconomic growth slowed significantly over the course of 2022. This was due partly to the macroeco-\nnomic effects of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. High inflation rates and risks to energy sup-\nplies also played a role. In the forecast period we expect a further deterioration in the conditions for eco-\nnomic growth. An end to the war in Ukraine, a sustainable solution for energy supplies or looser\nmonetary policy by central banks as a result of lower inflation rates could have a positive impact on fu-\nture economic performance, however.\nFuture development of results of operations\nGiven our diversified business model and multiple sources of revenue, and despite the tense macroeco-\nnomic environment, we believe we are very well positioned to further improve our earnings in the me-\ndium and long term. This expectation is based partly on the secular growth opportunities that we intend\nto exploit (for details, see the \u201cReport on opportunities\u201d), as well as on additional forecast inorganic\ngrowth.\nIn line with our strategy, we assume that net revenue will increase by at least 5 per cent in the forecast\nperiod on the basis of secular growth opportunities. We are driving this growth through investment. By\ndoing so, we aim to shift further market share from over-the-counter trading and clearing to the on-ex-\nchange segment and to further expand our positions in existing asset classes by introducing new prod-\nucts and functionalities and acquiring new customers. Thanks to the very good cyclical performance in\n2022, higher market volatility and rising interest rates, we assume that the cyclical net revenue contri-\nbution will either be only slightly positive or even negative in the forecast period. This depends largely on\nfuture changes in market volatility and interest rates, particularly with regard to net interest income from\nbanking business. In total, we therefore anticipate net revenue in the \u20ac4.5\u20134.7 billion range for the fore-\ncast period.\nWithin the context of our growth strategy, we pursue clearly defined principles for managing operating\ncosts. We achieve the necessary flexibility largely by making continuous improvements to our operating\nprocesses. This enables us to manage operating costs partly in line with net revenue growth. In the fore-\ncast period, we expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to increase\nto \u20ac2.6\u20132.8 billion.\nForecast for results of operations 2023\nBasis 2022 Forecast 2023\n\u20acm \u20acbn\nNet revenue 4,337.6 4.5\u20134.7\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 2,525.6 2.6\u20132.8\n92 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopment of non-financial performance indicators\nInitiatives to promote the transparency and security of the markets will continue to be a key focus during\nthe forecast period, ensuring that we add value for society. As far as the forecast development of non-\nfinancial performance indicators for 2023 is concerned, system availability (customer facing IT) was\nbrought back into line with the high targets by means of additional back-up measures, which became\npart of everyday operations. We therefore expect that the system availability (customer facing IT) will re-\nmain high in the forecast period.\nBeing an attractive employer is important for our sustained success. We want to attract top talents and\nretain them for the long term. The measures described in the chapter \u201cOur employees\u201d put us in a good\nposition and we are confident that we can maintain or improve on our employee satisfaction of more\nthan 71.5 per cent.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board has defined target quotas for women on the two management lev-\nels beneath the Executive Board, in accordance with section 76 (4) of the AktG, in each case referring to\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG. By 31 December 2023, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and\nsecond management levels beneath the Executive Board is planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per\ncent, respectively.\nMoreover, on a global group level the Executive Board adopted a voluntary commitment to increase the\nshare of women holding upper management positions to 23 per cent by the end of 2023, and of women\nholding lower management positions to 33 per cent during the same period. We have extended the\nscope of our voluntary commitment over and above the legal requirements.\nThe assessment of independent ESG rating agencies is an important benchmark for our ESG efforts. We\ncontinuously analyse our performance and take action accordingly. Over the forecast period we expect\nthat we will be able to maintain our good position above the 90th percentile of the ESG ratings.\nTargets for non-financial key performance indicators 2023\nBasis 2022 Target 2023\nSystem availability (customer facing IT) >99.9% >99.5%\nEmployee satisfaction 73% >71.5%\nWomen in leadership positions1 23% >23%\nESG ratings 98th percentile >90th percentile\n1) Group-wide target in senior management\n93 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on post-balance sheet date events\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopment of the financial position\nWe expect that cash flow from operating activities, which is our primary source of financing, will remain\nsignificantly positive in future. We expect that two significant factors will influence changes in liquidity:\nFirstly, we plan to invest around \u20ac300 million in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at\nGroup level. These investments will serve primarily to develop new products and services in our growth\nareas and to enhance existing ones. Secondly, we will propose a dividend of \u20ac3.60 per share to the An-\nnual General Meeting to be held in May 2023. This would represent a cash outflow of about\n\u20ac661,6 million. Apart from the above, we did not expect any other material factors to impact the\nGroup\u2019s liquidity at the time the combined management report was prepared. As in previous years, we\nassume that we will have a sound liquidity base in the forecast period due to positive cash flow from op-\nerating activities, adequate credit lines (for details see \u201cnote 25 to the consolidated financial state-\nments\u201d), and our flexible management and planning systems.\nWe generally aim to distribute dividends equivalent to between 40 and 60 per cent of net profit for the\nperiod attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. Within this range, we manage the actual\ndistribution ratio mainly in relation to our business performance and based on continuity considerations.\nIn addition, we plan to invest the remaining available funds primarily in the continued inorganic develop-\nment of the Group. Should we be unable to invest these funds, additional distributions, particularly\nshare buy-backs, represent another opportunity for the use of funds. To maintain its strong credit ratings\nat Group level, we aim for a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of no more than 1.75, and a ratio of free funds\nfrom operations to net debt of at least 50 per cent.\nOverall assessment by the Executive Board\nWe believe the Group remains very well positioned in terms of international competition, thanks to its\nbroadly diversified offering along the securities trading value chain and its innovative strength. This being\nthe case, we expect to see a positive trend in our results of operations over the long term. Measures\ntaken as part of our growth strategy should further accelerate this growth. In this context, we aim to be-\ncome more agile and effective and sharpen our client focus, in order to become the global market infra-\nstructure provider of choice, with a top ranking in all our business areas. We endeavour to expand our\nstructural growth areas further, and to increase their contribution to net revenue again by at least 5 per\ncent. Taking cyclical effects into account, we are planning an increase in net revenue to \u20ac4.5\u20134.7 billion\nin the forecast period. We expect EBITDA to go up to \u20ac2.6\u20132.8 billion in the forecast period. Overall, on\nthis basis we assume that cash flow from operating activities will be clearly positive and that, as in pre-\nvious years, the liquidity base will be sound. The overall assessment by the Executive Board is valid as\nat the publication date for this combined management report.\n12. Report on post-balance sheet date events\nThere are no material events to report.\n94 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\n13. Corporate governance statement\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group attaches great importance to the principles of good corporate governance and\ncontrol. In this statement, we report on corporate governance at Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in accordance with\nprinciple 23 of the Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex (the \u201cCode\u201d, German Corporate Governance\nCode). The statement contains the corporate governance statement pursuant to section 315d in conjunc-\ntion with section 289f of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, German Commercial Code).\nDeclaration of Conformity pursuant to section 161 Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation\nAct)\nOn 7 December 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG issued the fol-\nlowing Declaration of Conformity:\n\u201cDeclaration by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG regarding the Ger-\nman Corporate Governance Code in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\nAll recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the current version dated 28\nApril 2022, which was published in the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022, are currently complied with\nand shall continue to be complied with in the future.\nSince the last declaration of conformity was issued on 8 December 2021, all recommendations of the\nGCGC in the version dated 16 December 2019, which was published in the Federal Gazette on 20\nMarch 2020, have also been complied with.\nThe annual declaration of conformity pursuant to section 161 of the AktG can also be found online at\nwww.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Declaration of Conformity.\nThe declarations of conformity for the past five years are also available there.\nDisclosures on overriding statutory provisions\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG declare in accordance with recom-\nmendation F.4 GCGC that recommendation D.4 GCGC was not applicable to the company in 2022 be-\ncause of the overriding statutory requirement of section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange Act. Recom-\nmendation D.4 GCGC states that the Supervisory Board shall form a Nomination Committee composed\nexclusively of shareholder representatives. In accordance with section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange\nAct, however, the Nomination Committee also assists the Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in\nselecting candidates for the Executive Board. As this task shall not be performed exclusively by share-\nholder representatives of the Supervisory Board, and in line with the practice to date, the Nomination\nCommittee also includes employee representatives.\nDisclosures on suggestions of the Code\nThe GCGC consists of both recommendations (denoted in the text by the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d), which\nare reported in the Declaration of Conformity in accordance with section 161 of the AktG, and sugges-\ntions (denoted in the text by the use of the word \u201cshould\u201d).

This docu-\nment, which is adopted by the Executive Board and applies throughout the Group, defines the founda-\ntions of key ethical and legal standards, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the following topics:\n3) Compliance with legislation and regulations; whistleblowing\n3) Confidentiality and the handling of sensitive information\n3) Conflicts of interest\n3) Prevention of insider trading and market manipulation; personal account dealings\n3) Prevention of corruption\n3) Risk management\n3) Environmental awareness\n3) Equal opportunities and protection against undesirable behaviour\n3) Corporate responsibility; human rights; ethical conduct\nThe code of business conduct applies to members of the Executive Board, all other executives and all\nemployees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. In addition to specifying concrete rules, the code of business con-\nduct provides general guidance as to how employees can contribute to implementing the defined values\nin their everyday working life. The goal of the code of business conduct is to provide guidance on work-\ning together in the company on a day-to-day basis, to help resolve any conflicts and to resolve ethical\nand legal challenges. All newly hired employees receive the code of business conduct as part of their\nemployment contract documentation. The code of business conduct is an integral part of the relationship\nbetween employer and employees at Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group.

A key way in which we underscore the values we\nconsider important for the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group is by joining initiatives and organisations that advocate\ngenerally accepted ethical standards. Relevant memberships are as follows:\nUnited Nations Global Compact www.unglobalcompact.org: this voluntary business initiative estab-\nlished by the United Nations aims to achieve a more sustainable and more equitable global economy. At\nthe heart of the compact are ten principles covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment pro-\ntection and anti-corruption. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group has submitted annual communications on progress\n(COPs) on its implementation of the UN Global Compact since 2009.\nDiversity Charter www.charta-der-vielfalt.de: as a signatory to the Diversity Charter, the company has\ncommitted to acknowledging, respecting and promoting the diversity of its workforce, customers and\nbusiness associates \u2013 irrespective of their age, gender, disability, race, religion, nationality, ethnic back-\nground, sexual orientation or identity.\nInternational Labour Organization www.ilo.org: this UN agency is the international organisation re-\nsponsible for drawing up and overseeing international labour standards; it brings together representatives\nof governments, employees and employers to promote the joint development of policies and pro-\ngrammes. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group has signed up to the ILO\u2019s labour standards and hence has agreed to\nabide by them.\nSustainability in corporate governance\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It is there-\nfore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Super-\nvisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sus-\ntainability matters at Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It is supported by the cross-functional Group Sustainability\nBoard, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board\nfor sustainability topics in the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to envi-\nronmental, social and governance topics (ESG). One of the Group Sustainability Board\u2019s particular re-\nsponsibilities is to ensure that sustainability is incorporated into the company strategy. This includes ad-\nvising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The\nGroup ESG Strategy team, which reports to the CEO, provides support by coordinating overarching ESG\nproduct initiatives, managing the ESG reporting and continuously monitoring the ESG profile and climate\nstrategy of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group.\nAt the level of the Supervisory Board the responsibilities of the former Strategy Committee were ex-\npanded in 2021 to reflect the strategic importance of sustainability and it was renamed the Strategy and\nSustainability Committee. In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this\nway, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees,\nespecially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant\nsustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n97 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nTo promote the sustainable development of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, ESG targets are an integral part\nof the remuneration system for the Executive Board. Details of the Executive Board remuneration system\ncan be found in the \u201cRemuneration report\u201d.\nFurther information on this subject can be found online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibil-\nity > Sustainability. More information about the Supervisory Board committee Strategy and Sustainability\ncan be found in the chapter \u201cSupervisory Board committees\u201d. Details of the work carried out by the\nStrategy and Sustainability Committee are included in the \u201cSupervisory Board Report\u201d.\nSector-specific policies\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s pivotal role in the financial sector requires that it handles information \u2013 and es-\npecially sensitive data and facts \u2013 responsibly. A number of rules are in force throughout the Group to\nensure that employees comply with this. They comprise both statutory and internal rules that can be\nadapted specifically to individual industry segments. They include policies on whistleblowing, risk man-\nagement and the internal control system.\nWhistleblowing system\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group plays an active role in the fight against breaches of rules and regulations. One\nexample is Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s whistleblowing system, which provides a channel to report non-\ncompliant behaviour. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group uses the Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS\u00ae), an\nonline application that enables employees, clients and third parties to report matters that could be crimi-\nnal offences and incidents of non-compliance by employees or third parties concerning the business of\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Reports can be made in their own name or anonymously and can be made\naround the clock.\nFurther information regarding the whistleblowing system can be found at www.deutsche-boerse.com >\nOur Company > Contact > Whistleblower system.\nRisk and control management policies and principles\nFunctioning control systems are an important part of stable and sustainable business processes.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s enterprise-wide control systems are embedded in an overarching framework.\nThis comprises, among other things, the legal requirements, the recommendations of the German Corpo-\nrate Governance Code, international regulations and recommendations and other company-specific poli-\ncies. The executives responsible for the different elements of the control system are in close contact with\neach other and with the Executive Board. Key aspects of its design and implementation are also reported\nregularly to the Supervisory Board or its committees. Equally, the Group has an enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement system that covers and provides mandatory rules for functions, processes and responsibili-\nties. The internal control system and risk management system also cover sustainability-related targets.\nDetails of the internal control system and risk management at the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group can be found in\nthe \u201cRisk management\u201d section.\nFrom its examination of the internal control and risk management system and the reports of the Internal\nAudit function regarding its risk-oriented and process-independent controls conducted, the Executive\nBoard does not have any indications which would result in reservations regarding the appropriateness\nand efficacy of the systems.\n98 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nWorking practices of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\nAn important fundamental principle of the German Stock Corporation Act is the dual board system \u2013\nwhich assigns separate, independent responsibilities to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.\nThese responsibilities and their implementation at Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG are set out in detail in the follow-\ning paragraphs.\nBoth boards perform their duties in the interests of the company and with the aim of achieving a sus-\ntainable, long-term increase in value. Their actions are based on the principle of responsible corporate\ngovernance. Therefore, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board and Supervisory Board work closely to-\ngether in a spirit of mutual trust, with the Executive Board providing the Supervisory Board with compre-\nhensive information on the company\u2019s and the Group\u2019s position and the course of business in a regular\nand timely manner. In addition, the Executive Board regularly informs the Supervisory Board concerning\nissues relating to corporate planning, the risk situation and risk management, compliance and the com-\npany\u2019s control systems. The strategic orientation of the company is examined in detail and agreed upon\nwith the Supervisory Board. Implementation of the relevant measures is discussed at regular intervals.\nThe Chief Executive Officer reports to the Supervisory Board without undue delay, orally or in writing, on\nmatters that are of special importance to the company.\nIn addition, the CEO keeps the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed of the\ncurrent developments affecting the company\u2019s business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions\nand the long-term outlook and discusses these issues with him or her. The Supervisory Board may also\nrequest reports from the Executive Board at any time, especially on matters and business transactions at\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG and subsidiaries that have a significant impact on Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s position. The\nRules of Procedures for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board contain provisions on the corre-\nsponding information rights and obligations of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board exceeding\nstatutory regulations.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board\nThe Executive Board manages Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group; it had six members dur-\ning the reporting period. The main duties of the Executive Board include defining the Group\u2019s corporate\ngoals and sustainable strategic orientation, managing and monitoring the operating units, as well as es-\ntablishing and monitoring an efficient risk management system. The Executive Board is responsible for\npreparing the annual and consolidated financial statements of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, as well as for produc-\ning financial information during the course of the year. In addition, it must ensure the company\u2019s compli-\nance with legal requirements and official regulations.\nThe members of the Executive Board are jointly responsible for all aspects of management. Irrespective\nof this collective responsibility, the individual members manage the company\u2019s business areas assigned\nto them in the Executive Board\u2019s schedule of responsibilities independently and are personally responsi-\nble for them. In addition to the business areas, the functional areas of responsibility are that of the Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Information Officer/Chief Operating\nOfficer (CIO/COO) and Governance, People & Culture. The business areas cover the operating business\nunits, such as the company\u2019s cash market activities, the derivatives business, securities settlement and\ncustody, fund distribution services as well as the market data, financial and sustainability information\nbusiness.

Among other things, these list issues that are reserved for the entire Ex-\necutive Board, special measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board, other procedural de-\ntails and the arrangements for passing resolutions. The Executive Board holds regular meetings; these\nare convened by the CEO, who coordinates the Executive Board\u2019s work. Any Executive Board member\ncan require a meeting to be convened. In accordance with its bylaws, the entire Executive Board nor-\nmally takes decisions on the basis of resolutions passed by a simple majority of the members voting on\nthem in each case. If a vote is tied, the CEO has the casting vote.\nMore information on the Executive Board, its composition, members\u2019 individual appointments and biog-\nraphies can be found at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Ex-\necutive Board.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Supervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in its management of the company.\nThis also covers sustainability matters. The Supervisory Board supports the Executive Board in signifi-\ncant business decisions and provides assistance on strategically important issues. In the Rules of Proce-\ndures for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has defined transactions of fundamental im-\nportance which require its approval. In addition, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the\nmembers of the Executive Board, deciding on their total remuneration and examining Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nAG\u2019s annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report. Details of the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s work during the 2022 financial year can be found in the \u201cReport of the Supervisory\nBoard\u201d.\nThe Supervisory Board consists of 16 members, made up of an equal number of shareholder representa-\ntives and employee representatives in line with the German Mitbestimmungsgesetz (MitbestG, German\nCo-determination Act). The term of office of the current members ends at the Annual General Meeting in\n2024. This also applies to an employee representative who was appointed by the court to the Supervi-\nsory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in 2022 after the early voluntary retirement of another employee rep-\nresentative.\nThe Supervisory Board holds at least six regular meetings every year. In addition, extraordinary meetings\nare held as required. Executive Board members attend the meetings unless the Supervisory Board de-\ncides otherwise in any particular case. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Executive\nBoard. Exchanges also take place as necessary with the annual auditors. The committees also hold reg-\nular meetings. Unless mandatory statutory provisions or the Articles of Associations call for a different\nprocedure, the Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by a simple majority. If a vote is tied, the Chair\nhas the casting vote. The work of the Supervisory Board and its Committees is defined by the Rules of\nProcedure for the Supervisory Board, which is available under www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Re-\nlations > Corporate Governance > Supervisory Board > Rules of procedure.\n100 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the knowledge, skill and experience of the Executive Board and Supervi-\nsory Board and their members regularly, at least once a year, and examines the structure, size, composi-\ntion and performance of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Its review is based on a catalogue\nof specific targets, including qualification requirements, which, in turn, are reviewed regularly by the Su-\npervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also regularly, at least once a year, reviews the effectiveness of\nits work, discusses opportunities for improvement and decides on suitable measures if necessary. The\nconcrete targets are described in the chapter \u201cTargets for composition and qualification requirements of\nthe Supervisory Board\u201d and the annual effectiveness test is described in the chapter \u201cExamination of the\neffectiveness of Supervisory Board work\u201d.\nThe Chair of the Supervisory Board Chair is in regular contact with the representatives of shareholders\nand employees on the Supervisory Board, in addition to the scheduled meetings, and arranges talks to\nprepare for the Supervisory Board meetings as necessary.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s goal in establishing committees is to improve the effectiveness of its work by\nexamining complex matters in smaller groups that prepare them for the plenary meeting of the Supervi-\nsory Board. Additionally, the Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the\ncommittees, to the extent that this is legally permissible. The Supervisory Board had seven committees\nin the reporting period. The responsibilities of the existing Strategy Committee were expanded in 2021 to\nform a Strategy and Sustainability Committee. For details of the committees, please refer to the tables\n\u201cSupervisory Board committees in the reporting year: composition and responsibilities\u201d. Their individual\nresponsibilities are governed by the Supervisory Board\u2019s bylaws.

Details of the current duties and\nmembers of the individual committees can be found online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Corporate\nGovernance > Investor Relations > Supervisory Board > Committees.\nThe chairs of the individual committees report to the plenary meeting about the subjects addressed and\nresolutions passed in the committee meetings. Outside the meetings the Chair of the Audit Committee\nalso reports regularly to the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board on her regular exchanges\nwith the annual auditor. Information on the Supervisory Board\u2019s concrete work and meetings during the\nreporting period can be found in the \u201cReport of the Supervisory Board\u201d.\nMore information on the Supervisory Board and its committees, the individual members and their ap-\npointments and biographies, can be found at: www.deutsche-boerse.com > Corporate Governance >\nInvestor Relations > Supervisory Board.\n101 \n\nTargets for composition and qualification requirements of the Supervisory Board\nIn accordance with recommendation C.1 GCGC, the Supervisory Board has adopted a catalogue of spe-\ncific targets concerning its composition that should serve, above all, as a basis for the nomination of fu-\nture members. The targets include qualification requirements as well as diversity targets. Furthermore,\nmembers shall have sufficient time, as well as the personal integrity and suitability of character, to exer-\ncise their office. In addition, more than half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\nshall be independent. The targets, including the qualification requirements, are reviewed by the Supervi-\nsory Board regularly, at least annually, and modified as necessary. The status of implementation can be\nseen in the qualification matrix at the end of this statement.\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, ex-\npanded the specific targets in the qualification requirements explained below to include expertise in sus-\ntainability matters, and moreover adapted them to changes in statutory and regulatory requirements. The\nSupervisory Board, supported by the Nomination Committee, also examined the targets for the overall\nboard and for the individual members and confirmed that they had been met.\n105 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

The entries in the risk maps are labelled accordingly (E, S, G risk map items).\nIn the field of ongoing environmental, social and governance regulation, combined with efforts to im-\nprove economic resilience, there are a number of potential risks for our data, derivatives and index busi-\nness, particularly in view of the current geopolitical tension and economic volatility. If less ambitious\nsustainability policies lead to reduced investment in ESG products and to changes in investor prefer-\nences, then demand for our range of ESG products and services could decline or shift. A proposal for Eu-\nropean legislation to regulate ESG data and ratings providers is also expected in 2023. The latter could\nhave an adverse impact on Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. if the proposal includes a standardi-\nsation of methodologies for ESG ratings, and also affect other business units indirectly, such as our index\nbusiness. In addition, if ESG regulation in the field of sustainability standards and labels is deficient or\ntoo prescriptive, this could cause problems and uncertainty concerning its legal status, as well as a loss\nof market confidence. A decline in confidence in such standards and labels may have an adverse impact\non our ESG products across all business units, while an excessively prescriptive approach could inhibit\ninnovation and growth in the ESG segment of our data, derivatives and index business, as well as in the\nmarket overall.\nIf it is no longer possible to allocate capital efficiently to sustainable investments, or the calibration of\nsustainability policies and ESG regulation is not successful, this could impair the maturity, quality and\nliquidity of the market, the marketability and pricing of products, and risk management. Risks could also\nresult from a lack of interoperability between European ESG regulation and global developments. Busi-\nness risks could also be increased by far-reaching due-diligence obligations in supply and value chains,\nand so represent revenue risks.\nThe Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regularly considers whether to classify Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse AG as a financial holding company. It has currently come to the conclusion that Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nAG is not a financial holding company. Classification as a financial holding company could have an im-\npact on our capital requirements.\nCompliance \u2013 including measures against corruption and bribery\nResponsible business operations imply adherence to laws and regulations; they and are also based on\nthe principle of integrity and ethically irreproachable conduct at all times. We have implemented a com-\npliance management system (CMS) based on regulatory requirements, which aims to prevent miscon-\nduct and avoid liability and reputational risks for the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, its legal representatives, ex-\necutives and staff. Beyond business-related and regulatory compliance requirements, the focus is on\nstrengthening a uniform compliance culture throughout the Group, especially with a view to enhancing\ncompliance awareness.\n79 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCode of business conduct\nOur Group\u2019s code of business conduct summarises the most important aspects with regard to corporate\nethics and compliance as well as appropriate conduct. It is communicated to all employees in the Group\nand is available on the internet and intranet sites. Our code of business conduct summarises our core\nvalues and principles, which are intended to act as support for decision-making and enforce market in-\ntegrity, transparency, efficiency and security. Moreover, Group Compliance provides employees with com-\npliance-relevant information via the corresponding intranet pages, unless this is not possible for particu-\nlar confidentiality reasons. For details regarding the principles of responsible corporate governance, see\nthe section \u201cCorporate governance statement\u201d.\nAs a member of the UN Global Compact we are committed to its principles, notably to support human\nand labour rights, to protect the environment and to work against corruption in all its forms, which in-\ncludes extortion and bribery. These principles are also an integral part of our code of business conduct,\nwhich also prohibits any involvement in corruption or any activities which may lead to the impression\nthat the Group promises, arranges, provides, receives or asks for unlawful benefits. Bribery and facilita-\ntion payments are prohibited.\nObjectivity and integrity are the guiding principles for employees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Our manage-\nment is fully aware of their function as role models and the importance of the meaning \u201ctone from the\ntop\u201d, which makes it possible to draw the attention of every individual employee towards managing\ncompliance risks, both within the Group and among market participants. In order to sustainably anchor\nthese guiding principles, and to prevent the Group and its staff from legal sanctions and reputational\ndamage, Group Compliance has implemented risk-based compliance and preventive measures.\nCompliance management system\nThe compliance management system \u2013 under the responsibility of, and promoted by, the Executive\nBoard of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG \u2013 therefore constitutes an indispensable element of good corporate govern-\nance with respect to compliance. Group Compliance manages the CMS as a second line of defence func-\ntion and ensures compliance with legislation, regulations and internal rules, and promotes best practice\nwithin the Group. In addition, Group Compliance monitors, verifies and implements compliance\nmeasures to mitigate risks with negative impacts (e.g. direct or indirect financial losses, regulatory pen-\nalties or reputational damage). Such a CMS provides the foundation for sustainable risk transparency;\nspecifically, it facilitates the mitigation of compliance risks in the areas of money laundering/terrorism\nfinancing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest and\ninsider trading, as well as monitoring of requirements concerning financial sanctions and embargoes.\n2)\nThe CMS applies to Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and to the subsidiaries in Germany and abroad in which we\nhold a majority interest. Our Group-wide compliance approach is intended to ensure that our Group\ncompanies respect applicable legislation and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe CMS is assessed at least once a year using relevant criteria to ensure it is appropriate and effective,\nand a report is presented to the Audit Committee of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Supervisory Board. The criteria\ninclude i.a. the evaluation of compliance policies and frameworks, risk analyses, controls, training and\nthe regular reporting. In addition, risk-based internal and external audits are performed to validate the\nCMS.\nTo ensure that the CMS is appropriate and effective, and to reflect increasing complexity and growing\nregulatory demands, the CMS is regularly enhanced and improved. Our compliance measures enable us\nto identify, measure and manage compliance risks, particularly in the fields of money-laundering/ terror-\nism financing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest,\ninsider trading, financial sanctions and embargoes.\nWhen determining the focus and improvements of the CMS, we are guided by applicable prudential leg-\nislation and regulatory requirements, as well as by the recommendations of internationally accepted\nstandards. Based on these standards, Group Compliance identifies fields of action and measures to con-\ntinuously adapt the CMS to changing requirements.\nCurrently, Group Compliance is implementing the function of a Human Rights Officer to ensure that the\nrequirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains are met.\nCompliance organisational structure\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Executive Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. Com-\npliance reporting comprises the relevant compliance risks in the context of the compliance mandate, as\nwell as other compliance-relevant information and activities. The Chief Compliance Officers from group\ncompanies that are covered by banking regulation have functional reporting lines to the Group Chief\nCompliance Officer. The same applies to the Chief Compliance Officers of Qontigo, ECC/EEX and 360T.\nISS is regulated by the US Investment Advisers Act and has therefore set up a compliance function in\naccordance with the statutory requirements and designated a Chief Compliance Officer. In view of the\ndecision to manage ISS at arm\u2019s length, however, there is currently no functional reporting line to the\nChief Compliance Officer of the Group. In the course of implementing a group-wide compliance ap-\nproach, the implementation of the compliance group standards is still being pursued at ISS.\nThe Group Compliance Committee is an interdisciplinary committee at management level that aims to\nsupport and advise the respective Executive Boards and Compliance functions within Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nGroup on compliance topics. Committee members are the senior managers of the business units, the\nChief Compliance Officers of group companies and representatives of the relevant control functions.\nGroup Compliance also informs the committee about important compliance topics and incidents, as well\nas potential trends and regulatory developments.\n81 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCompliance measures\nCompliance2)rules\nGroup Compliance sets standards for the key compliance risks affecting all entities within the Group. In\nthis context, Group Compliance devises risk-oriented measures in order to mitigate and manage identi-\nfied risks; communicates about risks and incidents as well as the effectiveness of the measures taken.\nFurther Group Compliance ensures the continuous improvement of the CMS by regular adjustments to\nthe relevant internal policies and processes.\nThe group-wide applicable compliance policies have been implemented to ensure that the internal stake-\nholder groups and employees acting on behalf of the Group implement and follow its rules and require-\nments. In this way, group-wide compliance violations shall be addressed preventively, detectively, and\nsanctionally. Group-wide communications via the intranet are geared towards providing employees (in-\ncluding members of the Executive Board and managers) with the necessary guidance for their daily work\nand ensuring compliance.\nCompliance training\nRegular compliance trainings are a fundamental instrument for promoting the compliance culture and\ncompliance awareness across the Group. Our employees around the world are trained regularly on the\nrelevant compliance topics. Our compliance trainings particularly cover the topics of money-laundering/\nterrorism financing, criminal offences, ethics, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts\nof interest, insider trading, financial sanctions and embargoes. Our management, that is exposed to a\nhigher compliance risk by virtue of their work receive additional training as required. Participation in\nabove mentioned trainings is mandatory for our employees, as well as for management.\nWhistleblowing2)system\nWe support, by lived compliance awareness, an open approach towards managing misconduct. For this\nreason, employees are encouraged to address their concerns directly to the responsible line manager, HR\nor to Group Compliance. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s whistleblowing system (BKMS) offers an additional\nand anonymous channel for reporting potential or confirmed breaches of prudential or regulatory require-\nment and ethical standards. Employees, service providers and third parties can submit reports via tele-\nphone or e-mail. The anonymity of whistleblowers is guaranteed at all times.\nAnalysis of compliance risks\nIn line with regulatory requirements, we carry out risk analyses regularly and, if needed, on an ad hoc\nbasis in order to be able to understand and assess relevant compliance risks and to derive risk mitigating\nmeasures based on the results. Such risk analyses and assessments comprise the Group\u2019s own business\nactivities as well as business relationships, market participants, products and services.\nA Group-wide compliance risk assessment framework was implemented last year to standardise the pro-\ncess of identifying, analysing and assessing compliance risks within the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. The de-\nveloped methodology is to be applied for the first time in 2023.\n82 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nIn the context of the current geopolitical events in Ukraine and the resulting potential economic policy\nconsequences, Group Compliance continues to analyse which risks could have an impact in the individ-\nual business areas and which measures need to be taken and implemented. This concerns all risks for\nGroup companies that have business relationships with companies based in the affected countries\n(Ukraine, Russia), hold assets or have other connections of both an economic and technical nature. The\nGroup has implemented a robust and flexible system to manage any sanctions and embargo risks. Dedi-\ncated sanctions experts monitor current developments carefully and are in regular contact with stake-\nholders and the business areas of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group in order to be able to react to restrictions in\na timely manner.\n\nNumber of justified customer complaints relating to data protection 0 0\n1) All employees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group must repeat the web-based ABC training every two years. Since the update and completion of the training takes place in\nodd years, the number of completed trainings in the even year 2022 is significantly lower.\nRegulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\nClearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG, in their capacity as credit\ninstitutions, are subject to solvency supervision by the German or Luxembourg banking supervisory au-\nthorities (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin, and Commission de Surveillance du\nSecteur Financier, CSSF, respectively). The same applies to the Clearstream Holding at a regulatory\ngroup level. Eurex Repo GmbH and 360 Treasury Systems AG are also subject to specific provisions ap-\nplicable to investment firms.\nNodal Clear, LLC is a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) subject to regulation by the US Commod-\nity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nCrypto Finance (Brokerage) AG is authorised as securities firm according to Article 41 of the Swiss Fed-\neral Act on Financial Institutions (FinIA) while Crypto Finance (Asset Management) AG is authorised as\nmanager of collective investments according to the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA).\nBoth are subject to the supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).\nMarket risk exposure only results from relatively small open foreign currency positions.\nThe following table shows the regulatory own funds requirements per risk category which are derived\nfrom the risk exposure amount with a capital ratio of 8%.\n\n1) Clearstream Banking AG\u2019s previous year\u2019s figures were updated based on the previous-year\u2019s audited financial statements.\nNo capital contributions were made in 2022, but they are planned for the years ahead in order to\nstrengthen the capital base. In February 2023, Clearstream Banking AG carried out a capital injection of\n\u20ac30.0 million. The reason for the strengthening of the capital base is primarily a change in the interpre-\ntation of capital requirements by the supervisory authorities.\nRegulatory capital ratios according to CRR\n\n1) Clearstream Banking AG\u2019s previous year\u2019s figures were updated based on the previous-year\u2019s audited financial statements.\n2) According to Art. 26 Abs. 1 (a) CRR, capitel insturments must comply with the requirements pursuant to Art. 28 CRR. As of 31 December 2021, the profit and loss\ntransfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art. 28 (3) (d) CRR. Therefore, the regulatory own funds\nwere reduced subsequently as per 31 December 2021 to the amount of subscribed capital of \u20ac25.0 million. Furthermore, previous year\u2019s own funds requirements were\nadjusted.\nClearstream Banking AG\u2019s capital requirements according to CSDR are currently significantly above CRR\nand CRD IV capital requirements. The capital requirements under Article 47 CSDR do not stipulate a\nspecific ratio. Instead, the total of share capital and reserves is compared with the capital requirements\nand has to be at least the same.\n84 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nCapital adequacy requirements under CSDR\n\n\n1) As the annual financial statements of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group are published prior to the finalization of Clearstream Banking S.A.'s and Clear-\nstream Banking AG's approved annual financial statements, the calculation of the other CSDR capital requirements have been based on the previous year\u2019s ap-\nproved annual financial statements.\nCapital adequacy requirements under EMIR\nEuropean Commodity Clearing\n\n1) Previous year adjusted\nThe Investment Firm Regulation requires 360 Treasury Systems AG as an investment firm of category 2\nto hold own funds of the higher of a) 25 per cent of the fixed overheads, b) a fixed minimum initial capi-\ntal requirement of the entity or c) the capital requirements calculated based on the K factors. Eurex Repo\nGmbH determines its own funds requirements according to its classification as small and non-intercon-\nnected investment firm based on the higher of a) or b) as described above. The capital requirement for\n360T and also for the Eurex Repo currently corresponds to 25 per cent of the respective fixed overheads\nof the previous year.\nComposition of own funds/capital requirements\n\n1) According to Art. 26 Abs. 1 (a) CRR, capital instruments must comply with the requirements pursuant to Art. 28 CRR. As of 31 December 2021, the profit and loss\ntransfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art. 28 (3) (d) CRR. Therefore, the regulatory own funds\nwere reduced subsequently as per 31 December 2021 to the amount of subscribed capital of \u20ac25.0 million. Furthermore, previous year\u2019s own funds requirements were\nadjusted.\nCompliance with own funds requirements\n\nThe regulatory minimum requirements were complied with at all times by all companies during the re-\nporting period and in the period up to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.2)2)\n86 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Risk management\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nOverall assessment of the risk situation by the Executive Board\nSummary\nThe risk profile of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group did not change significantly in the 2022 financial year. All\nknown impacts of the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments were actively managed within the\nGroup and potential new risks were analysed on an ongoing basis. The aggregate total risk of Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse Group comprising of all risk types (operational, financial, pension and business risk) was always\nmatched by sufficient covered funds. As of 31 December 2022, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s required eco-\nnomic capital (REC) amounted to \u20ac1,754 million, an almost 4 per cent decline year on year (31 De-\ncember 2021: \u20ac1,827 million, measured with a 99.9 per cent confidence level). It is covered by a risk-\nbearing capacity of \u20ac7,742 million.\nNo significant change in the risk situation of the Group is foreseeable for the Executive Board at the pre-\nsent time.\nOutlook\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group continually assesses its risk situation. Based on the calculated REC in stress tests\nand based on the risk management system, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board concludes that the\navailable risk cover amount and the available liquidity are sufficient. There is currently no indication that\nthe risk coverage amount has to be adjusted for 2023. Furthermore, it cannot identify any risk that\nwould endanger the Group\u2019s existence as a going concern.\nIn 2023 we intend to continue strengthening and expanding its risk management and internal control\nsystem (ICS). This includes, for example, the expansion of information security management, ongoing\nmethodological improvements in risk management and the ICS, and a closer coordination between con-\ntrol functions, also by means of a Groupwide governance, risk and compliance tool.\n87 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nIn addition, on 9 February 2023, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud to en-\nhance, economize and concentrate Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s cloud adoption. Google Cloud will become\nour preferred partner for the next ten years and help to further enhance the group\u2019s cloud adoption and\nefficiency. Specifically, we will leverage Google Cloud\u2019s secure infrastructure and leading data and analyt-\nics capabilities to accelerate the development of our digital securities platform D7, innovate our digital\nasset market operations, and enhance our data distribution and data use cases in the cloud.\nAs already stated, distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents another technological opportunity. It is\nconsidered a disruptive technology at times \u2013 but at present, the financial services sector is increasingly\nexploring its opportunities. Thanks to its decentralised nature, it facilitates direct interaction between par-\nticipants, thus offering the potential for simplifying complex processes. Established market infrastructure\nproviders such as Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, which covers the entire value creation chain from a single\nsource, play an important role when it comes to tapping this potential \u2013 meeting existing industry stand-\nards at the same time. Besides legal and regulatory requirements, this also involves adhering to security\nstandards, as well as limiting risks and ensuring cost efficiency. This enables, e.g., the development of\ndigital issuance of financial products via the D7 platform which shortens the extensive and multi-day is-\nsuance process to just a few minutes. The enhancement of D7 platform with decentral capabilities, in\nline with the respective regulations and market interest, could complement the offer in further jurisdic-\ntions. Like this, the central securities depository is creating a fully digital alternative to conventional se-\ncurities issuance. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) is the first issuer to have launched a digital fixed-\nincome bond in the form of central register security based on the German Electronic Securities Act\n(eWpG) in December 2022.\nM&A growth opportunities2)\nInorganic growth is an equally important part of Compass 2023. We focus on areas that are closely re-\nlated to our strategic growth areas, which include the data, index and analytics business, ESG, commod-\nities, forex trading, fixed income trading and investment fund services. The aim is to accelerate growth in\nthese areas by means of mergers and acquisitions and make our businesses even more scalable.\n11. Report on expected developments\nThe forecast describes our expected performance in the 2023 financial year. It contains statements and\ninformation on events in the future and is based on the company\u2019s expectations and assumptions at the\ntime of publication of this corporate report. In turn, these are subject to known and unknown opportuni-\nties, risks and uncertainties. Numerous factors, many of which are outside the company\u2019s control, influ-\nence the Group\u2019s success, its business strategy and its financial results. Should opportunities, risks or\nuncertainties materialise, or should one of the assumptions made turn out to be incorrect, the Group\u2019s\nactual performance could deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations and assumptions\ncontained in the forward-looking statements and information contained in this report on expected devel-\nopments.\n91 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopments in the operating environment\nMacroeconomic environment\nEconomic growth slowed significantly over the course of 2022. This was due partly to the macroeco-\nnomic effects of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. High inflation rates and risks to energy sup-\nplies also played a role. In the forecast period we expect a further deterioration in the conditions for eco-\nnomic growth. An end to the war in Ukraine, a sustainable solution for energy supplies or looser\nmonetary policy by central banks as a result of lower inflation rates could have a positive impact on fu-\nture economic performance, however.\nFuture development of results of operations\nGiven our diversified business model and multiple sources of revenue, and despite the tense macroeco-\nnomic environment, we believe we are very well positioned to further improve our earnings in the me-\ndium and long term. This expectation is based partly on the secular growth opportunities that we intend\nto exploit (for details, see the \u201cReport on opportunities\u201d), as well as on additional forecast inorganic\ngrowth.\nIn line with our strategy, we assume that net revenue will increase by at least 5 per cent in the forecast\nperiod on the basis of secular growth opportunities. We are driving this growth through investment. By\ndoing so, we aim to shift further market share from over-the-counter trading and clearing to the on-ex-\nchange segment and to further expand our positions in existing asset classes by introducing new prod-\nucts and functionalities and acquiring new customers. Thanks to the very good cyclical performance in\n2022, higher market volatility and rising interest rates, we assume that the cyclical net revenue contri-\nbution will either be only slightly positive or even negative in the forecast period. This depends largely on\nfuture changes in market volatility and interest rates, particularly with regard to net interest income from\nbanking business. In total, we therefore anticipate net revenue in the \u20ac4.5\u20134.7 billion range for the fore-\ncast period.\nWithin the context of our growth strategy, we pursue clearly defined principles for managing operating\ncosts. We achieve the necessary flexibility largely by making continuous improvements to our operating\nprocesses. This enables us to manage operating costs partly in line with net revenue growth. In the fore-\ncast period, we expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to increase\nto \u20ac2.6\u20132.8 billion.\nForecast for results of operations 2023\nBasis 2022 Forecast 2023\n\u20acm \u20acbn\nNet revenue 4,337.6 4.5\u20134.7\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 2,525.6 2.6\u20132.8\n92 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on expected developments\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopment of non-financial performance indicators\nInitiatives to promote the transparency and security of the markets will continue to be a key focus during\nthe forecast period, ensuring that we add value for society. As far as the forecast development of non-\nfinancial performance indicators for 2023 is concerned, system availability (customer facing IT) was\nbrought back into line with the high targets by means of additional back-up measures, which became\npart of everyday operations. We therefore expect that the system availability (customer facing IT) will re-\nmain high in the forecast period.\nBeing an attractive employer is important for our sustained success. We want to attract top talents and\nretain them for the long term. The measures described in the chapter \u201cOur employees\u201d put us in a good\nposition and we are confident that we can maintain or improve on our employee satisfaction of more\nthan 71.5 per cent.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board has defined target quotas for women on the two management lev-\nels beneath the Executive Board, in accordance with section 76 (4) of the AktG, in each case referring to\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG. By 31 December 2023, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and\nsecond management levels beneath the Executive Board is planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per\ncent, respectively.\nMoreover, on a global group level the Executive Board adopted a voluntary commitment to increase the\nshare of women holding upper management positions to 23 per cent by the end of 2023, and of women\nholding lower management positions to 33 per cent during the same period. We have extended the\nscope of our voluntary commitment over and above the legal requirements.\nThe assessment of independent ESG rating agencies is an important benchmark for our ESG efforts. We\ncontinuously analyse our performance and take action accordingly. Over the forecast period we expect\nthat we will be able to maintain our good position above the 90th percentile of the ESG ratings.\nTargets for non-financial key performance indicators 2023\nBasis 2022 Target 2023\nSystem availability (customer facing IT) >99.9% >99.5%\nEmployee satisfaction 73% >71.5%\nWomen in leadership positions1 23% >23%\nESG ratings 98th percentile >90th percentile\n1) Group-wide target in senior management\n93 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Report on post-balance sheet date events\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDevelopment of the financial position\nWe expect that cash flow from operating activities, which is our primary source of financing, will remain\nsignificantly positive in future. We expect that two significant factors will influence changes in liquidity:\nFirstly, we plan to invest around \u20ac300 million in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at\nGroup level. These investments will serve primarily to develop new products and services in our growth\nareas and to enhance existing ones. Secondly, we will propose a dividend of \u20ac3.60 per share to the An-\nnual General Meeting to be held in May 2023. This would represent a cash outflow of about\n\u20ac661,6 million. Apart from the above, we did not expect any other material factors to impact the\nGroup\u2019s liquidity at the time the combined management report was prepared. As in previous years, we\nassume that we will have a sound liquidity base in the forecast period due to positive cash flow from op-\nerating activities, adequate credit lines (for details see \u201cnote 25 to the consolidated financial state-\nments\u201d), and our flexible management and planning systems.\nWe generally aim to distribute dividends equivalent to between 40 and 60 per cent of net profit for the\nperiod attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG. Within this range, we manage the actual\ndistribution ratio mainly in relation to our business performance and based on continuity considerations.\nIn addition, we plan to invest the remaining available funds primarily in the continued inorganic develop-\nment of the Group. Should we be unable to invest these funds, additional distributions, particularly\nshare buy-backs, represent another opportunity for the use of funds. To maintain its strong credit ratings\nat Group level, we aim for a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of no more than 1.75, and a ratio of free funds\nfrom operations to net debt of at least 50 per cent.\nOverall assessment by the Executive Board\nWe believe the Group remains very well positioned in terms of international competition, thanks to its\nbroadly diversified offering along the securities trading value chain and its innovative strength. This being\nthe case, we expect to see a positive trend in our results of operations over the long term. Measures\ntaken as part of our growth strategy should further accelerate this growth. In this context, we aim to be-\ncome more agile and effective and sharpen our client focus, in order to become the global market infra-\nstructure provider of choice, with a top ranking in all our business areas. We endeavour to expand our\nstructural growth areas further, and to increase their contribution to net revenue again by at least 5 per\ncent. Taking cyclical effects into account, we are planning an increase in net revenue to \u20ac4.5\u20134.7 billion\nin the forecast period. We expect EBITDA to go up to \u20ac2.6\u20132.8 billion in the forecast period. Overall, on\nthis basis we assume that cash flow from operating activities will be clearly positive and that, as in pre-\nvious years, the liquidity base will be sound. The overall assessment by the Executive Board is valid as\nat the publication date for this combined management report.\n12.

Corporate governance statement\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group attaches great importance to the principles of good corporate governance and\ncontrol. In this statement, we report on corporate governance at Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in accordance with\nprinciple 23 of the Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex (the \u201cCode\u201d, German Corporate Governance\nCode). The statement contains the corporate governance statement pursuant to section 315d in conjunc-\ntion with section 289f of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, German Commercial Code).\nDeclaration of Conformity pursuant to section 161 Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation\nAct)\nOn 7 December 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG issued the fol-\nlowing Declaration of Conformity:\n\u201cDeclaration by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG regarding the Ger-\nman Corporate Governance Code in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\nAll recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the current version dated 28\nApril 2022, which was published in the Federal Gazette on 27 June 2022, are currently complied with\nand shall continue to be complied with in the future.\nSince the last declaration of conformity was issued on 8 December 2021, all recommendations of the\nGCGC in the version dated 16 December 2019, which was published in the Federal Gazette on 20\nMarch 2020, have also been complied with.\nThe annual declaration of conformity pursuant to section 161 of the AktG can also be found online at\nwww.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Declaration of Conformity.\nThe declarations of conformity for the past five years are also available there.\nDisclosures on overriding statutory provisions\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG declare in accordance with recom-\nmendation F.4 GCGC that recommendation D.4 GCGC was not applicable to the company in 2022 be-\ncause of the overriding statutory requirement of section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange Act. Recom-\nmendation D.4 GCGC states that the Supervisory Board shall form a Nomination Committee composed\nexclusively of shareholder representatives. In accordance with section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange\nAct, however, the Nomination Committee also assists the Supervisory Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG in\nselecting candidates for the Executive Board. As this task shall not be performed exclusively by share-\nholder representatives of the Supervisory Board, and in line with the practice to date, the Nomination\nCommittee also includes employee representatives.\nDisclosures on suggestions of the Code\nThe GCGC consists of both recommendations (denoted in the text by the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d), which\nare reported in the Declaration of Conformity in accordance with section 161 of the AktG, and sugges-\ntions (denoted in the text by the use of the word \u201cshould\u201d).

This docu-\nment, which is adopted by the Executive Board and applies throughout the Group, defines the founda-\ntions of key ethical and legal standards, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the following topics:\n3) Compliance with legislation and regulations; whistleblowing\n3) Confidentiality and the handling of sensitive information\n3) Conflicts of interest\n3) Prevention of insider trading and market manipulation; personal account dealings\n3) Prevention of corruption\n3) Risk management\n3) Environmental awareness\n3) Equal opportunities and protection against undesirable behaviour\n3) Corporate responsibility; human rights; ethical conduct\nThe code of business conduct applies to members of the Executive Board, all other executives and all\nemployees of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. In addition to specifying concrete rules, the code of business con-\nduct provides general guidance as to how employees can contribute to implementing the defined values\nin their everyday working life. The goal of the code of business conduct is to provide guidance on work-\ning together in the company on a day-to-day basis, to help resolve any conflicts and to resolve ethical\nand legal challenges. All newly hired employees receive the code of business conduct as part of their\nemployment contract documentation. The code of business conduct is an integral part of the relationship\nbetween employer and employees at Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group.

At\nthe heart of the compact are ten principles covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment pro-\ntection and anti-corruption. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group has submitted annual communications on progress\n(COPs) on its implementation of the UN Global Compact since 2009.\nDiversity Charter www.charta-der-vielfalt.de: as a signatory to the Diversity Charter, the company has\ncommitted to acknowledging, respecting and promoting the diversity of its workforce, customers and\nbusiness associates \u2013 irrespective of their age, gender, disability, race, religion, nationality, ethnic back-\nground, sexual orientation or identity.\nInternational Labour Organization www.ilo.org: this UN agency is the international organisation re-\nsponsible for drawing up and overseeing international labour standards; it brings together representatives\nof governments, employees and employers to promote the joint development of policies and pro-\ngrammes. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group has signed up to the ILO\u2019s labour standards and hence has agreed to\nabide by them.\nSustainability in corporate governance\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It is there-\nfore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Super-\nvisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sus-\ntainability matters at Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It is supported by the cross-functional Group Sustainability\nBoard, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board\nfor sustainability topics in the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to envi-\nronmental, social and governance topics (ESG). One of the Group Sustainability Board\u2019s particular re-\nsponsibilities is to ensure that sustainability is incorporated into the company strategy. This includes ad-\nvising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The\nGroup ESG Strategy team, which reports to the CEO, provides support by coordinating overarching ESG\nproduct initiatives, managing the ESG reporting and continuously monitoring the ESG profile and climate\nstrategy of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group.\nAt the level of the Supervisory Board the responsibilities of the former Strategy Committee were ex-\npanded in 2021 to reflect the strategic importance of sustainability and it was renamed the Strategy and\nSustainability Committee. In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this\nway, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees,\nespecially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant\nsustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n97 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nTo promote the sustainable development of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, ESG targets are an integral part\nof the remuneration system for the Executive Board. Details of the Executive Board remuneration system\ncan be found in the \u201cRemuneration report\u201d.\nFurther information on this subject can be found online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibil-\nity > Sustainability. More information about the Supervisory Board committee Strategy and Sustainability\ncan be found in the chapter \u201cSupervisory Board committees\u201d. Details of the work carried out by the\nStrategy and Sustainability Committee are included in the \u201cSupervisory Board Report\u201d.\nSector-specific policies\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s pivotal role in the financial sector requires that it handles information \u2013 and es-\npecially sensitive data and facts \u2013 responsibly. A number of rules are in force throughout the Group to\nensure that employees comply with this. They comprise both statutory and internal rules that can be\nadapted specifically to individual industry segments. They include policies on whistleblowing, risk man-\nagement and the internal control system.\nWhistleblowing system\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group plays an active role in the fight against breaches of rules and regulations. One\nexample is Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s whistleblowing system, which provides a channel to report non-\ncompliant behaviour. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group uses the Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS\u00ae), an\nonline application that enables employees, clients and third parties to report matters that could be crimi-\nnal offences and incidents of non-compliance by employees or third parties concerning the business of\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group. Reports can be made in their own name or anonymously and can be made\naround the clock.\nFurther information regarding the whistleblowing system can be found at www.deutsche-boerse.com >\nOur Company > Contact > Whistleblower system.\nRisk and control management policies and principles\nFunctioning control systems are an important part of stable and sustainable business processes.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group\u2019s enterprise-wide control systems are embedded in an overarching framework.\nThis comprises, among other things, the legal requirements, the recommendations of the German Corpo-\nrate Governance Code, international regulations and recommendations and other company-specific poli-\ncies. The executives responsible for the different elements of the control system are in close contact with\neach other and with the Executive Board. Key aspects of its design and implementation are also reported\nregularly to the Supervisory Board or its committees. Equally, the Group has an enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement system that covers and provides mandatory rules for functions, processes and responsibili-\nties. The internal control system and risk management system also cover sustainability-related targets.\nDetails of the internal control system and risk management at the Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group can be found in\nthe \u201cRisk management\u201d section.\nFrom its examination of the internal control and risk management system and the reports of the Internal\nAudit function regarding its risk-oriented and process-independent controls conducted, the Executive\nBoard does not have any indications which would result in reservations regarding the appropriateness\nand efficacy of the systems.\n98 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nWorking practices of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\nAn important fundamental principle of the German Stock Corporation Act is the dual board system \u2013\nwhich assigns separate, independent responsibilities to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.\nThese responsibilities and their implementation at Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG are set out in detail in the follow-\ning paragraphs.\nBoth boards perform their duties in the interests of the company and with the aim of achieving a sus-\ntainable, long-term increase in value. Their actions are based on the principle of responsible corporate\ngovernance. Therefore, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board and Supervisory Board work closely to-\ngether in a spirit of mutual trust, with the Executive Board providing the Supervisory Board with compre-\nhensive information on the company\u2019s and the Group\u2019s position and the course of business in a regular\nand timely manner. In addition, the Executive Board regularly informs the Supervisory Board concerning\nissues relating to corporate planning, the risk situation and risk management, compliance and the com-\npany\u2019s control systems. The strategic orientation of the company is examined in detail and agreed upon\nwith the Supervisory Board. Implementation of the relevant measures is discussed at regular intervals.\nThe Chief Executive Officer reports to the Supervisory Board without undue delay, orally or in writing, on\nmatters that are of special importance to the company.\nIn addition, the CEO keeps the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed of the\ncurrent developments affecting the company\u2019s business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions\nand the long-term outlook and discusses these issues with him or her. The Supervisory Board may also\nrequest reports from the Executive Board at any time, especially on matters and business transactions at\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG and subsidiaries that have a significant impact on Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s position. The\nRules of Procedures for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board contain provisions on the corre-\nsponding information rights and obligations of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board exceeding\nstatutory regulations.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse AG\u2019s Executive Board\nThe Executive Board manages Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG and Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group; it had six members dur-\ning the reporting period.

The Supervisory Board supports the Executive Board in signifi-\ncant business decisions and provides assistance on strategically important issues. In the Rules of Proce-\ndures for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has defined transactions of fundamental im-\nportance which require its approval. In addition, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the\nmembers of the Executive Board, deciding on their total remuneration and examining Deutsche B\u00f6rse\nAG\u2019s annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report. Details of the\nSupervisory Board\u2019s work during the 2022 financial year can be found in the \u201cReport of the Supervisory\nBoard\u201d.\nThe Supervisory Board consists of 16 members, made up of an equal number of shareholder representa-\ntives and employee representatives in line with the German Mitbestimmungsgesetz (MitbestG, German\nCo-determination Act). The term of office of the current members ends at the Annual General Meeting in\n2024.

Its review is based on a catalogue\nof specific targets, including qualification requirements, which, in turn, are reviewed regularly by the Su-\npervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also regularly, at least once a year, reviews the effectiveness of\nits work, discusses opportunities for improvement and decides on suitable measures if necessary. The\nconcrete targets are described in the chapter \u201cTargets for composition and qualification requirements of\nthe Supervisory Board\u201d and the annual effectiveness test is described in the chapter \u201cExamination of the\neffectiveness of Supervisory Board work\u201d.\nThe Chair of the Supervisory Board Chair is in regular contact with the representatives of shareholders\nand employees on the Supervisory Board, in addition to the scheduled meetings, and arranges talks to\nprepare for the Supervisory Board meetings as necessary.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s goal in establishing committees is to improve the effectiveness of its work by\nexamining complex matters in smaller groups that prepare them for the plenary meeting of the Supervi-\nsory Board. Additionally, the Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the\ncommittees, to the extent that this is legally permissible. The Supervisory Board had seven committees\nin the reporting period. The responsibilities of the existing Strategy Committee were expanded in 2021 to\nform a Strategy and Sustainability Committee. For details of the committees, please refer to the tables\n\u201cSupervisory Board committees in the reporting year: composition and responsibilities\u201d.

Information on the Supervisory Board\u2019s concrete work and meetings during the\nreporting period can be found in the \u201cReport of the Supervisory Board\u201d.\nMore information on the Supervisory Board and its committees, the individual members and their ap-\npointments and biographies, can be found at: www.deutsche-boerse.com > Corporate Governance >\nInvestor Relations > Supervisory Board.\n101 \n\nTargets for composition and qualification requirements of the Supervisory Board\nIn accordance with recommendation C.1 GCGC, the Supervisory Board has adopted a catalogue of spe-\ncific targets concerning its composition that should serve, above all, as a basis for the nomination of fu-\nture members. The targets include qualification requirements as well as diversity targets. Furthermore,\nmembers shall have sufficient time, as well as the personal integrity and suitability of character, to exer-\ncise their office. In addition, more than half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\nshall be independent. The targets, including the qualification requirements, are reviewed by the Supervi-\nsory Board regularly, at least annually, and modified as necessary. The status of implementation can be\nseen in the qualification matrix at the end of this statement.\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, ex-\npanded the specific targets in the qualification requirements explained below to include expertise in sus-\ntainability matters, and moreover adapted them to changes in statutory and regulatory requirements. The\nSupervisory Board, supported by the Nomination Committee, also examined the targets for the overall\nboard and for the individual members and confirmed that they had been met.\n105 \nExecutive and Supervisory Boards\nManagement report | Corporate governance statement\nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

It highlights the company's commitment to improving and sustaining high standards of governance practices across different domains.\n\nTrusted business partner thanks to compliance culture\nWe render all of our services in compliance with current legislation as well as our corporate values as defined in our Group policies.\nOne important aspect of compliance is the legal requirements relating to preventing corruption and bribery. We observe all\napplicable international anti-corruption standards and statutes and are a member of the Partnering Against Corruption initiative of\nthe World Economic Forum.\nEnsuring legally compliant conduct in our business activities and in our interactions with employees is an essential task of all Group\nmanagement bodies. Our compliance management system (CMS) has been implemented Group-wide. Responsibility for designing\nthe CMS lies with the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CFO. This establishes uniform minimum standards to\nensure compliance with applicable law, for example anti-corruption legislation, and relevant internal guidelines such as the Anti-\nCorruption and Business Ethics Policy (Anti-Corruption Policy). The divisional compliance officers are tasked with the\nimplementation of the CMS within the divisions.\n78 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nWith our Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy, along with training on these topics, we provide clear guidance and help\nemployees identify situations in which the integrity of the company could be called into question.\nParticipation of executives in middle and upper management, as well as of employees in certain functions, in various types of\nrelevant compliance training is mandatory. In this way, we raise our employees\u2019 awareness for potential compliance risks and\nenable them to mitigate such risks in an appropriate manner. The compliance training courses comprise our Core Compliance\nCurriculum (anti-corruption, competition compliance, Code of Conduct) and training on data protection. All employees in the target\ngroup are required to repeat the training courses every two years. We use the share of valid training certificates among executives\nin middle and upper management as a steering-relevant KPI.\nPotential violations can be reported 24/7 \u2013 if legally permitted, anonymously \u2013 via our compliance incident reporting system\n(whistleblower hotline). In addition, potential violations can also be reported by telephone. Third parties can also use the system to\nreport potential violations. Reports are reviewed and investigated internally for potential violations as part of a standardized\nprocess. Key figures on compliance notifications and issues are recorded throughout the Group via the compliance reporting tool\n(BKMS Dashboard). Information on relevant violations is collected and included in the regular compliance reports made to the\nBoard of Management and to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Finance and Audit Committee.\nThe importance and value that compliance has for the Group was once again emphasized for employees by means of a campaign \u2013\nCompliance Awareness Week \u2013 which was rounded out by measures tailored to the specific divisions and regions. The campaign\nwas accompanied by statements from the Board of Management members (\u201ctone from the top\u201d) and supported by panel\ndiscussions with managers. To strengthen the internal dialogue, our workforce was made aware of and informed about compliance\naspects on an ongoing basis by means of further communication measures and via the compliance channels.\nThe compliance training certification rate was 98.6% in middle and upper management in the year under review (previous year:\n98.1%), meaning we exceeded our target of 98% in the year under review. In the context of its 219 audits, Corporate Internal Audit\nalso reviewed compliance management system processes and the implementation of agreed-upon follow-up measures. Findings\nfrom the regular audits facilitate the identification of other compliance risks and the refinement of the compliance program.\nRespecting human rights\nOur commitment to respect for human rights includes adherence to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the International\nLabor Organization (ILO), which we have embedded in our Code of Conduct and outlined in greater detail in our Human Rights\nPolicy Statement. These stipulate clear responsibilities and requirements for our employees and managers as well as our suppliers\nand subcontractors and contribute to the general understanding and implementation of the principles of the UN Global Compact.\nOur human rights activities focus on the prevention of child and forced labor, decent working conditions (working hours,\noccupational health and safety, remuneration), equal opportunities, data protection and the right to freedom of association. With\nthe Supplier Code of Conduct, we obligate suppliers and subcontractors to comply with our ethical, social and environmental\nprinciples and implement them in their own supply chains.\nWith our measures for respecting human rights in the workforce and in the supply chain, we are in compliance with the\nrequirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz \u2013 LkSG). Implementation of the\nmeasures is monitored by the LkSG Council. The board is made up of executives in upper management from the Group functions\nHuman Resources, Corporate Development, Corporate Public Affairs, Legal Services and Global Compliance, Corporate\nProcurement and Corporate Internal Audit.\nAs part of its audits, Corporate Internal Audit also conducted reviews relating to respect for human rights and verified that the\nagreed-upon follow-up measures had been implemented. In the reporting year, 53 such reviews took place.\n79 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nHuman rights in the workforce\nWith our internal management system, we ensure that our Human Rights Policy Statement is implemented among our workforce.\nIn addition, it ensures that we adhere to due diligence requirements. Our management system is comprised of annual as well as ad\nhoc assessments of human rights risks, measures to raise awareness among employees and managers, annual reporting on Group-\nwide fulfillment of due diligence requirements and the professional compliance incident reporting system.\nWe carry out both an abstract and a concrete risk analysis to determine human rights risks. First, the risk is analyzed using external\ndata (Verisk Maplecroft). Then, it is substantiated by evaluating questionnaires completed by our country organizations on the\nbasis of their specific risk profile.\nTargeted on-site reviews are carried out based on the risk assessments. These reviews are conducted by specially trained and\nexternally SMETA-certified (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) professionals from our divisions and corporate headquarters. The\ncountries are selected based on the results of weighting and prioritization of the identified risks, including \u2013 among other factors \u2013\nthe findings from the questionnaires, the number of employees, the assessments of relevant Group committees and responsible\nexperts and recommendations from international trade union confederations. If there are violations identified at locations, these\nare then immediately addressed as part of a structured action plan. In the year under review, on-site reviews under the leadership\nof the HR department were carried out at more than 30 subsidiaries in ten countries, including in Asia, Latin America, Africa and\nEurope.\nWe encourage our employees to participate in the training courses for raising awareness for respect for human rights. Participation\nis mandatory, however, for executives in middle and upper management; the certification rate was 99.5% in the reporting period\n(previous year: 98.4%).\nStandards in the supply chain\nCorporate Procurement selects suppliers that meet our ethical, social and environmental standards. This selection process is based\non a standardized assessment process that also takes aspects such as diversity and respect for human rights into account, as well\nas external criteria such as those from Transparency International (Corruption Perceptions Index) and Verisk Maplecroft. In the year\nunder review, the supplier assessment was supplemented with additional internal measures and expanded with external audits\n(including in accordance with the SMETA method). In the event of findings, remedial measures are discussed and plans for\ncorrective measures are agreed upon.\nProcurement employees are regularly trained to identify potential supplier-related risks early on. We convey our expectations to\nour suppliers and subcontractors via our Supplier Portal and introduce our selection processes. Suppliers can also use our portal to\nfamiliarize themselves with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which we make available in numerous languages along with the\ncorresponding training module. From there, they can also access our professional compliance whistleblower system that they can\nuse to report potential violations of the Code or statutory provisions as well as cybersecurity incidents.\nIn the year under review, we continued developing the Group-wide risk management system for supplier assessments. We\ncalculate the potential for risk of suppliers at the level of purchase categories (material groups). The risk assessment is influenced\nby 46 types of risk within eight risk domains (ESG, economic, technical, legal and political risks, as well as cybersecurity) that are\nevaluated for each individual purchasing category. The ultimate classification of the risk potential is based on the evaluation of the\nprobability and the possible impact. More than 4,000 potential high-risk suppliers were assessed in the year under review\n(previous year: >2,700).\nWe use supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct to measure the successful implementation of our\nstandards in the supply chain. We record progress regarding the key figure via the central financial systems, report to management\non a monthly basis and discuss developments with the CEO and the CFO. In the year under review, supplier spend covered by an\naccepted Supplier Code of Conduct rose to more than \u20ac35 billion (previous year: >\u20ac27 billion).\n80 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nCybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity management activities protect the information of the Group, our business partners and our employees as well as\nIT systems from unauthorized access or manipulation and data misuse. In addition, this ensures uninterrupted availability and\nenables reliable operations. Our internal guidelines and processes are based on ISO 27002 and our data centers are certified in\naccordance with ISO 27001.\nSince January 1, 2024, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO) has reported directly to the CEO (previous year:\nCorporate Board Member for Global Business Services). The IT Board determines the cybersecurity strategy and defines and\nmanages Group-wide measures for cybersecurity, for protecting systems and data and for digitalization processes. The Information\nSecurity Committee is made up of the central functions of Group CISO, IT Audit, Human Resources, Legal Services, Data Protection\nand Corporate Security, as well as the divisional CISOs. The committee assesses potential threats on an ongoing basis, evaluates\nthe potential of new risks and monitors compliance with our security standards.\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can only access the data they need to perform their duties. All\nsystems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. Additionally, by performing\ncontinuous software updates, we can fix potential security vulnerabilities and protect system functionality.\nA variety of communication measures and training sessions help our workforce become more aware of possible cybersecurity risks.\nAll employees and managers with a corporate email address are continuously made aware of risks via phishing simulations. We\nalso draw attention to current risks using IT crisis simulations. Participation in Information Security Awareness training is\nmandatory for all employees with a computer workstation. All participants who have already completed their training must update\ntheir certification every two years.\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This rating is based on the technical\nanalysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company; this is carried out by an\nautomated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables\ncomparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as with\nmajor customers and logistics companies that are not covered by the DAX 40. The target amount is determined by the aspiration to\nbe within the upper quarter of this comparison group.\nThe cybersecurity rating has been remuneration-relevant since this reporting period. This performance indicator makes up 10% of\nthe annual bonus calculation for the Board of Management. As announced, the rating scale for the cybersecurity rating in the year\nunder review has changed due to adjustments to the method of the rating agency. In line with the change, we adjusted our target\nfor the 2023 fiscal year from 710 to 690 points. The rating amounted to 750 of 820 achievable points as of the end of the year\nunder review (previous year: 700 points). The target for the year under review was thus exceeded.\nTax strategy as a standard adhered to worldwide\nOur tax strategy is aligned with our Group strategy and must be adhered to throughout the Group. The overarching approach\napplied by the Group is that taxes are always incidental to and follow business needs.\nWe do not undertake aggressive tax planning or enter into artificial arrangements with the goal of avoiding taxes. Our Group\nmaintains locations in more than 220 countries and territories, including some with lower tax rates than those in Germany. These\nlocations are necessary for carrying out our operational business in those regions. None of our companies was established with the\npurpose of obtaining tax benefits or is currently used to pursue aggressive tax structuring.\nIn interpreting and applying tax legislation, we follow the letter of the law; in case of ambiguity, we follow the law\u2019s spirit and\nintended purpose. As a globally active group of companies, our activities necessarily include operations in countries where\nuncertainty is high. In order to mitigate this uncertainty and obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, we are in\ncontinual dialogue with tax authorities and tax advisers. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in\nwhich we operate. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor\ntax risks and respective countermeasures.\nPursuant to Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as Delegated Regulations\n2021/2178 and 2023/2486 of the European Commission.\nContribution to the climate and environmental objectives of the European Union\nWe report our contribution to the European Union\u2019s (EU) six environmental objectives according to the guidelines laid down in the\nEU Taxonomy regulation and report the taxonomy-aligned (aligned) and taxonomy-eligible shares of revenue, capital expenditure\n(capex) and operating expenditure (opex).\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities (activities) are considered environmentally sustainable and therefore aligned if they make a\nsubstantial contribution to one of the six EU environmental objectives and are not associated with significant harm to one or more\nother environmental objectives (do-no-significant-harm (DNSH) criteria). In addition, for all activities, the Group complies with\nrequired frameworks for minimum safeguards that relate to respecting human rights and social and labor standards, as well as\nanti-corruption fair competition and taxation.\nAligned activities exclusively make a substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 1. No aligned activities were identified\nin conjunction with EU environmental objective 2 that make a substantial contribution to risk avoidance or the reduction of the risk\nof adverse effects of the current and projected climate on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets without increasing the\nrisk of adverse effects on people, nature or assets. The activities in the area of construction and real estate make no substantial\ncontribution to EU environmental objective 4.\nSIX EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES\n1 Climate change mitigation\n2 Climate change adaptation\n3 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n4 Transition to a circular economy\n5 Pollution prevention and control\n6 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe requirements of the EU Taxonomy were expanded in the year under review: new activities in the air freight sector were added\nto the first EU environmental objective, and further activities were added to the EU environmental objectives 3 to 6. The taxonomy\neligibility was determined and reported for these new activities. In accordance with this, we primarily carry out activities in EU\nenvironmental objectives 1 and 2; with regard to EU environmental objective 4, two activities fall under the area of construction\nand real estate.\nThe Group policy for implementing the requirements of the EU Taxonomy includes the guidelines for determining the aligned\nshares of revenue, capex and opex. The data is collected accordingly in the Group-wide finance and controlling systems. In the year\nunder review, the Group policy and the Group-wide finance and controlling systems were adapted with regard to the additional\nrequirements. For the first time, we can now report the taxonomy-eligible shares of our air freight operations.\nDevelopment of the Taxonomy KPIs\nThe taxonomy-eligible and -aligned shares increased compared with the previous year. The expansion of the taxonomy\nrequirements in the area of air freight in particular played a significant role in the increase in taxonomy eligibility. The increase in\ntaxonomy alignment results from our decarbonization measures in the pickup and delivery fleet and the improved identification of\ntaxonomy-aligned activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy still does not take into account all economic activities that are relevant for our business. Revenue from operating\nwarehouses (Supply Chain division) in particular is therefore not reported as taxonomy-eligible.\nCapex generated by the addition of assets can be assigned directly to individual activities, while revenue and opex can generally not\nbe directly assigned. In these cases, we primarily use a cost-based allocation logic that reflects the business models of the divisions.\nWe avoid double counting by assigning revenue, capex and opex to only one activity respectively and taking intra-Group\nrelationships into account on a consolidated basis. Property, plant and equipment from business combinations were primarily\nallocated to the \"Construction and real estate\" and \"Transport\" sectors; intangible assets from business combinations were\nclassified as (cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:91)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:92)(cid:16)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72).\n84 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nDetermining taxonomy alignment\nAll taxonomy-eligible activities were reviewed with regard to their alignment in the year under review. The following statements\nare in regard to the aligned assets per activity and the associated shares of revenue, capex and opex.\nAPPLIED EVALUATION METHOD\nTechnical evaluation criterion Method\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation: Does no Carried out on the basis of individual assets or groups of assets, provided that the\nsignificant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objectives of the evaluation of the criteria is possible on a superordinate level by means of uniform\nsustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Group processes and within the framework of applicable national or EU regulations.\n(DNSH 3), the transition to a circular economy (DNSH 4), pollution These values were assessed as not aligned in all other cases. Various technical\nprevention and control (DNSH 5), the protection and restoration of screening criteria relate to requirements from applicable EU legislation. If no equivalent\nbiodiversity and ecosystems (DNSH 6) requirements apply in non-EU countries, no alignment can be demonstrated\naccordingly.\nDoes no significant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objective The climate-change-related risk assessment was carried out based on the TCFD\nof climate change adaptation (DNSH 2) analysis, which we supplemented with adjustment solutions for physical climate risks.\nEU minimum safeguards for the respect for human rights and the Ensured with our Code of Conduct, the Group policies on anti-corruption and standards\npreserving of employees\u2019 rights, as well as regarding anti-corruption, for business ethics, the environment and energy, the Competition Compliance Policy,\nfair competition and taxation the Human Rights Policy Statement, the corresponding processes and management\nsystems, the regular audits carried out by Corporate Internal Audit and the Group Tax\nStrategy. Ensured in the supply chain with our Supplier Code of Conduct, the\nprocurement processes and supplier management, as well as the implementation of\nthe requirements under the LkSG. At the time this report was prepared, there were no\nrelevant legal proceedings ongoing in this context.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from transport services (transport sector) in collaboration with suppliers and\nsubcontractors, who render their services on an independent basis from a legal perspective. As a result, these activities and the\nassets associated with them must be evaluated there with regard to alignment with the EU Taxonomy. At the time this report was\nprepared, we largely did not have any information on the meeting of technical criteria for these activities and assets, so we are\nreporting them as not taxonomy-aligned, in particular in the activities 6.2, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.10. Even suppliers and subcontractors\nwho report pursuant to the EU Taxonomy were unable to confirm to us the alignment of their underlying activities. If shares of\nrevenue and opex cannot be directly assigned to aligned activities, we apply specific allocation keys \u2013 such as the percentage of\ntaxonomy-aligned vehicles in the entire fleet \u2013 that also take individual characteristics of the divisions into account.\n85 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nthe performance of the world economy and global economic output. Unless otherwise specified, a low relevance is attached to the\nindividual opportunities and risks within the respective categories. The opportunities and risks generally apply to all divisions,\nunless indicated otherwise.\n\n1 Material opportunities and risks are referenced based on the corresponding figures in the following descriptions of individual categories.\nBoth the material as well as the immaterial opportunities and risks from the overview are specified in the following. Unless\notherwise explicitly labeled, these are considered immaterial.\nOpportunities and risks arising from corporate strategy\nOver the past few years, the Group has ensured that its business activities are well positioned in the world\u2019s fastest-growing\nregions and markets. We are also constantly working to create efficient structures in all areas to enable us to flexibly adapt\ncapacities and costs to demand, which is a condition for lasting, profitable business success. With respect to our strategic\norientation, we are focusing on our core competencies in the logistics and letter mail businesses. Our earnings projections regularly\ntake account of development opportunities arising from our strategic orientation.\nWe take action early to counter potential strategic risks. In doing so, it helps that our portfolio of customers and supplier companies\nis as broad as possible and that we focus on profitable sectors and products, regularly review customer and product performance,\npractice strict cost management and add surcharges whenever necessary.\n100 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nIn the Express division, our future success depends, above all, upon general factors such as trends in the competitive environment,\ncosts and quantities transported. In addition, market capacities could restrict our pricing leeway due to market pressure from\ncustomers and competitors, which represents a risk of medium significance for us (1). We plan to keep growing our international\nbusiness and expect a further increase in shipment volumes over the medium and long term. Based upon this assumption, we are\ninvesting in our network, our services, our employees and the DHL brand.\nIn the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we purchase transport services for customers from airlines, shipping companies and\nfreight carriers rather than providing them ourselves. In the best case, we are able to outsource transport services at such a low\nrate that we can generate a margin. In the worst-case scenario, we bear the risk of not being able to pass on all price increases to\nour customers. The extent of our opportunities and risks essentially depends on trends in the supply, demand and pricing of\ntransport services as well as the duration of our contracts. Comprehensive knowledge in the area of brokering transport services\nhelps us to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risk.\nIn the Supply Chain division, our success is highly dependent on our customers\u2019 business performance. Since we offer companies a\nwidely diversified range of products in different sectors all over the world, we are able to diversify our risk portfolio and thus\ncounteract the incumbent risks. Our future success moreover depends on our ability to continuously improve our existing business,\nseamlessly integrate new business and grow in our most important markets and segments.\nThe eCommerce division is responsible for domestic and international non-time-definite standard parcel delivery services in\nvarious countries around the globe. It predominantly serves customers in the fast-growing e-commerce sector. Our goal is to\nleverage our international resources and services to build a cross-border solutions platform that can be connected to the most\ncost-efficient networks for last-mile delivery. We want to grow profitably in all sectors and segments. To counteract the\nfundamental risk of rising cost pressure, we took measures with which we intend to improve network efficiency and cost flexibility.\nWhether e-commerce merchants invest in the establishment and operation of delivery organizations in addition to other market\nparticipants results in opportunities and risks for the eCommerce division, as well as for the parcel business in Germany. In this\nregard, it can be observed that this type of investing activity currently appears to be in decline among e-commerce merchants.\nIn the German mail and parcel business, we are responding to the challenges posed by the structural shift from a physical to a\ndigital business and the continual decline in letter mail occurring parallel to the steady increase in volumes of parcels and\nmerchandise mail items. We are counteracting the risk arising from changing demand by expanding our range of services. Due to\nthe rise in e-commerce, we expect our parcel business to continue growing in the coming years and are therefore expanding our\nnetwork of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing\nas a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible. We follow developments in the\nmarket very closely and take them into account in our earnings projections.\nWe currently do not see any further specific corporate strategy opportunities or risks of material significance, either for the Group\nor individual divisions.\nLegal and compliance-related opportunities and risks\nLegal disputes may arise in the case of noncompliance with national or international laws and regulations as well as agreements.\nExamples are violations of antitrust and competition law. Investigations of any such violations may result in considerable costs,\npenalties and damage to our company\u2019s reputation, which could have a disadvantageous impact on the business activities of the\nGroup.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and agreements is a clearly formulated obligation of all employees of the Group, and ensuring\nthis is one of the fundamental tasks of our managers. To support our employees and managers, we have established a corporate\ncompliance unit differentiated according to relevant topics that, on the basis of our risk management system, monitors compliance\nwith Group-wide standards at both Group and divisional level with respect to typical compliance risks. Thus, in addition to our\ncompliance initiative aimed at preventing fraud and fighting corruption and violations of cartel and competition law, we have\nintroduced initiatives in all divisions intended to ensure compliance with data protection laws \u2013 for example, to ensure adherence to\nthe provisions of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A similar, Group-wide compliance initiative\n101 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\naims to ensure adherence to international and national export controls and embargo regulations. Moreover, our compliance unit\nsupports, coordinates and monitors the observance of human rights and the fundamental environmental standards in our own\noperations as well as in our external supply chain.\nAt present, we do not see any specific legal or compliance-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\nOpportunities and risks arising from capital expenditure and projects\nThe Group invests in maintaining and growing its network, in buildings and technical equipment, in IT solutions and in its fleet of\nvehicles and freight aircraft. The objective of the investment projects is to strengthen the positioning of our divisions in\nconsideration of aspects related to economic efficiency and ESG.\nThe risks associated with the investments relate primarily to deviations in costs and timelines as well as to the complexity of the\nprojects and the availability of resources. This can lead to adverse effects on the economic efficiency, continuity and quality of our\nservices.\nThe aforementioned risks are monitored via ongoing project management and investment controlling so that targeted\ncountermeasures can be taken at an early stage. The status of investment projects is documented on a regular basis and reported\nto the Group Board of Management and, for larger projects, to the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Group Board of Management\nis informed promptly of any critical projects.\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of investment projects.\nOperational opportunities and risks\nLogistics services are generally provided in bulk and require a complex operational and external infrastructure with high quality\nstandards. Any weaknesses with regard to the tendering, sorting, transport, warehousing, customs clearance or delivery of\nshipments could seriously compromise our competitive position. In particular, the impairment of significant infrastructure such as\ncentral transport hubs can have negative effects. To consistently guarantee reliability and punctual delivery, processes must be\norganized so as to proceed smoothly with no technical or personnel-related glitches. We counteract potential operational risks, for\nexample through efficient workflows and structures. We also take out insurance policies to guard against potential losses.\nMost recently, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the global pandemic in recent years, have revealed\nhow external factors can restrict our transport routes and means or reduce the availability of our employees, and hence potentially\nimpair our operating performance. For information on the measures we are taking to protect our employees, please refer to the\ncategories titled \u201cHuman resources\u201d and \u201cEnvironment, catastrophes and epidemics.\u201d\nA large number of internal processes must be aligned so that we can render our services. These include \u2013 in addition to our\nfundamental operating processes \u2013 supporting functions such as sales and purchasing. The extent to which we succeed in aligning\nour internal processes to meet customer needs while simultaneously lowering costs correlates with potential positive deviations\nfrom the current projections. Our earnings projections already incorporate the expected cost savings.\nIncreased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change can be expected in the coming years, including limits on air\ntransport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our business models. The resulting risk represents a risk of\nmedium significance for us currently (2).\nAt this time, we do not see any additional specific operational opportunities or risks of material significance.\n102 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nOpportunities and risks arising from human resources\nQualified, dedicated and motivated employees are a prerequisite for sustainable success. Demographic change and a tense labor\nmarket situation across all job types in some regions represent a challenge for recruiting workers on a local level. To address this\nadequately and to avoid labor shortages, we place particular emphasis on our recruiting activities. In addition, we prevent staff\nshortages through recruiting measures abroad, by using skilled labor migration and by hiring refugees.\nFor our business success and a low level of staff turnover, it is important to provide our employees with development opportunities\nand foster their long-term loyalty to the company. In this context, we value the professional development of our executives, with\nour Group-wide Leadership Attributes serving as a guide for action. Furthermore, we ensure that our employees are able to\ncontinuously improve their skills in line with their needs through on-the-job learning opportunities as well as off-the-job training\ncourses.\nThe health and safety of our employees are of central importance for DHL Group. We therefore place a high value on health and\noccupational safety measures. With respect to occupational health, we make use of initiatives tailored to local requirements and\ncooperate across divisions in the management of healthcare initiatives. This is supplemented with health and exercise programs\nand targeted checkup offers on-site. In addition, we address risks in the area of mental health using prevention, including by means\nof a continuously refined system for assessing risks associated with mental stresses and as part of our Certified programs for staff\ndevelopment.\nAs a globally active company with approximately 590,000 employees (headcount as of December 31, 2023) in over 220 countries\nand territories, upholding human rights is a top priority for us. We account for this responsibility through our Human Rights Policy\nStatement. If infringements are reported, we will take appropriate measures for clarification.\nThe development of staff costs is a key factor for us due to the large number of employees. This factor is also being driven by the\ncurrently high levels of inflation. The current collective bargaining agreement of Deutsche Post AG is valid for 2023 and 2024. The\ndevelopment of staff costs is no longer a risk of material significance for us at this time.\nOverall, we do not currently see any personnel-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\nOpportunities and risks arising from information technology\nThe security of our information systems is particularly important to us. The goal is to ensure continuous IT system operation and\nprevent unauthorized access to our systems and databases. To this end, we have defined guidelines, standards and procedures\nbased upon ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management. In addition, IT risks are monitored and\nassessed on an ongoing basis by Group Risk Management, Corporate Internal Audit, Data Protection and Corporate Security.\nFor our business processes to run smoothly at all times, the essential IT systems must be continuously available. We have therefore\ndesigned our systems to protect against complete system failure. Our software is monitored and updated regularly to address\npotential bugs, close gaps in security and increase functionality. We employ a patch management process \u2013 a defined procedure for\nmanaging software upgrades \u2013 to control risks that could arise from outdated software or from software upgrades. In this context,\nwe use structured processes to collect and check the devices and software versions used in our IT network, the goal being to\nachieve the highest possible level of coverage.\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can generally only access the data they need to perform their duties.\nSystems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. We make use of outsourced\ndata centers of established providers and operate central data centers in the Czech Republic, Malaysia and the United States. Our\nsystems are thus geographically separate and, in addition, are replicated at local disaster recovery locations.\n103 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nGOVERNANCE\nAnnual Corporate Governance Statement\npursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB with respect to Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG and DHL Group.\nDeclaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\nDeutsche Post(cid:3)AG complied with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year\nunder review. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board intend to comply with all suggestions and recommendations in\nthe future as well. In December(cid:3)2023, they issued the following Declaration of Conformity:\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG declare that, since the issue of the Declaration of\nConformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code, as\namended on April 28, 2022, and published in the (cid:291)(cid:336)(cid:329)(cid:319)(cid:320)(cid:334)(cid:316)(cid:329)(cid:341)(cid:320)(cid:324)(cid:322)(cid:320)(cid:333) (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, have been complied with,\nand that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward.\nYou can view the current Declaration of Conformity and the Annual Corporate Governance Statement along with the Declarations\nof Conformity for the past five years on the company\u2019s website.\nCorporate governance principles and shared values\nOur business relationships and activities are based upon responsible business practices that comply with applicable laws,\ninternational guidelines and ethical standards, and this also forms part of the Group\u2019s strategy. Equally, we require our suppliers to\nact in this way. We encourage relationships with our employees, customers and other stakeholders, as well as the shareholders,\nwhose decisions to select DHL Group as an employer, supplier or investment are increasingly also based upon the requirement that\nwe apply good corporate governance criteria.\nWith the Code of Conduct, we have laid out the requirements of the conduct of our employees. It is applicable across all divisions and\nregions. In the Code of Conduct, we commit ourselves in particular to the principles set out in the United Nations (UN) Global\nCompact, comply with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and follow additional recognized legal\nstandards, including the applicable anti-corruption legislation and agreements. In addition, we take the International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational\nEnterprises into account. In addition, we support various sustainability initiatives, for example to promote the development of\nsustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of\ngreenhouse gases. As a long-standing partner of the United Nations, we support the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIn 2023, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\nThe Code of Conduct also describes our understanding of diversity and inclusion. This understanding and mutual respect promote\ncooperation within the Group and thus contribute to economic success. The criteria for the recruitment and professional\ndevelopment of our employees are exclusively their skills and qualifications. The members of the Board of Management and the\nSupervisory Board support the diversity measures, with a particular focus on the Group\u2019s goal of increasing the number of women\nin management. Doing business includes using our expertise as a service provider in the mail services and logistics sector for the\nbenefit of society and the environment, and we motivate our employees to engage personally in this regard.\nEnsuring that our interactions with business partners, shareholders and the public are conducted with integrity and within the\nbounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation. This is also the foundation of DHL Group\u2019s lasting business success. Our\ncompliance management system (CMS) is designed to promote legally compliant conduct as well as to prevent corruption and\nanticompetitive conduct in particular. Insights gained from compliance audits and reported violations are also used to continually\nimprove and upgrade the CMS system. To this end, the enhanced compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard) offers Group-wide,\n112 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\ncentralized and systematic collection of all key figures related to compliance notifications and the clarification of issues. In addition,\nfurther measures were taken to promote the culture of compliance and compliance reporting was established.\nCooperation between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, remuneration, retirement ages\nAs a listed German public limited company, Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG has a two-tier board structure comprising the Board of Management\nand the Supervisory Board.\nMembers of the Board of Management are responsible for the management of the company. They manage their Board\ndepartments independently, except where decisions of particular significance and consequence for the company or the Group\nrequire a resolution by all members of the Board of Management. Each member of the Board of Management is obligated to\nsubordinate the interests of their individual Board departments to the collective interests of the company and to inform the Board\nof Management about significant developments in their departments. The Board of Management ensures compliance with\nstatutory provisions and internal guidelines within the company (compliance). The internal control system and the risk\nmanagement system comprise a CMS aligned with the risk situation of the company and also include targets related to\nsustainability.\nThe CEO conducts Board of Management business, aligns Board department activities with the company\u2019s collective goals and\nplans, and ensures that corporate policy is carried out. When making decisions, members of the Board of Management may not act\nin their own personal interest or exploit corporate business opportunities for their own benefit. Any conflicts of interest must be\ndisclosed to the chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management without delay; the other Board of Management\nmembers must also be informed. The Supervisory Board has determined that appointments to the Board of Management should\ngenerally end by the time the member turns 65.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board appoint, advise and oversee the Board of Management. They propose the remuneration\nsystem for Board of Management members to the Annual General Meeting, and \u2013 together with the Board of Management \u2013 are\njointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. Furthermore, the statutory obligations of\nthe Supervisory Board include the review and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the review of the\nproposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit and the recommendation of the auditor to the Annual General Meeting.\nFor proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board will ensure that their term of office ends no\nlater than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member turns 72. As a general rule,\nSupervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\nThe company\u2019s D & O (directors and officers) insurance for the members of the Board of Management provides for a deductible as\nset out in the AktG.\nThe principles governing the Supervisory Board\u2019s internal organization, a catalog of Board of Management transactions requiring\napproval and the work of the Supervisory Board committees are governed by the rules of procedure, which are available on the\ncompany\u2019s website. The Chair, elected by the members of the Supervisory Board from their ranks, coordinates the work of the\nSupervisory Board and represents the Supervisory Board publicly. The Chair holds talks with investors on topics relevant to the\nSupervisory Board. The Supervisory Board represents the company in respect of the Board of Management members. Members of\nthe Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual remuneration of \u20ac100,000. The remuneration for each of the chairs (plenary and\ncommittees) increases by 100%, for the Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and for committee members by 50%. This does not\napply to the Mediation or Nomination Committees. The report on remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board\nmembers can be accessed along with the auditor\u2019s report pursuant to Section 162(3) AktG on the company\u2019s website. There are no\ncontracts between the company and Supervisory Board members, with the exception of the employment contracts with the\nemployee representatives.\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least twice each half year, regularly also without the Board of Management present. Extraordinary\nmeetings are held as required. In the 2023 fiscal year, Supervisory Board members held four plenary meetings, 21 committee\nmeetings and one closed meeting. The meetings took place in person, with a few exceptions for the committee meetings. Individual\n113 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nmembers joined via videoconference. In cases where individual members were unable to participate, they submitted their votes in\nwriting in advance of the meeting and thus ensured that the decisions made were based on the decisions of all responsible\nmembers. The overall attendance rate of 95% is broken down by member in the report of the Supervisory Board.\nSupervisory Board decisions are prepared in advance in separate meetings of the shareholder representatives and the employee\nrepresentatives, and by the relevant committees. During the plenary meetings, the committee chairs inform the other members\nabout the work and decisions of the committees. Supervisory Board members are personally responsible for ensuring they receive\ntraining and professional development measures. They receive appropriate support from the company in the process. In 2023, the\nDirectors\u2019 Days took place in May and September. The topics covered included the regulation of the postal market, ESG key\nperformance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply\nchain legislation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting and the EU Taxonomy.\nSuccession planning for the Board of Management\nTogether with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the\nBoard of Management. To this end, in particular the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly discuss\ncandidates with the potential to take on positions on the Board of Management. Within the Supervisory Board, the search for\nsuitable Board of Management members is primarily the responsibility of the Executive Committee. In the event of an upcoming\nvacancy, the Executive Committee selects suitable candidates for personal interviews, taking into account specific requirements for\nexperience and qualifications to be met by the members and the composition of the Board of Management as a whole and, after\ndiscussing this list of candidates, submits it to the Supervisory Board.\nIndependent of specific upcoming vacancies, potential successors from within the Group are given the opportunity to give a\npresentation on topics from their own areas of responsibility before the Supervisory Board. In this way, the Supervisory Board\nmaintains an overview of the potential of Group executives who could be considered for a position on the Board of Management.\nWhen appointing new members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board ensures that the different skills and\nexperiences of the members supplement the Board of Management and that its membership is thus diverse. International\nexperience is of particular importance, in addition to industry experience. The initial term of service for members of the Board of\nManagement generally runs for three years.\nIndependence of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\nAll Supervisory Board members are independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code. This exceeds the\ntarget for the Supervisory Board of filling at least 60% of mandates on the shareholder side with independent members.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest shareholder in the company, KfW Bankengruppe, holds 20.49% of the shares in Deutsche\nPost(cid:3)AG and therefore does not exercise control, nor does the German federal government, which is an indirect shareholder via the\nKfW. Accordingly, Luise H\u00f6lscher and Stefan B. Wintels are also independent. On February 7, 2024, KfW Bankengruppe reduced its\nshareholding in Deutsche Post AG to 16.45%.\nStefan Schulte, who is resigning from the Supervisory Board after the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 3, 2024, has\ncontributed his comprehensive expertise and experience to the benefit of the company throughout his term of office and, as the\nChair of the Financial and Audit Committee, engaged the Board of Management in differentiated and critical discussions. His\nindependence was therefore not in question at any time for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will recommend two\nnew independent Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting to succeed Stefan Schulte and Simone Menne, who\nis also stepping down from the Finance and Audit Committee. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the\nreport of the Supervisory Board.\nLawrence Rosen\u2019s responsibility for the Board department Finance ended more than seven years ago and therefore does not impair\nhis independence. At the same time, his profound knowledge of the company and the industry make it possible for him to support\nthe Board of Management as an experienced and expert adviser and to perform the monitoring duties of the Supervisory Board in\nparticular.\n114 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

Our focus at all times is on preventing potential violations of statutory\nrequirements and internal guidelines.\nCorporate Internal Audit evaluates the effectiveness of our risk management system, control mechanisms, management and\nmonitoring processes and compliance with Group policies, contributing to their improvement. It does this by performing\nindependent regular and ad hoc audits at all Group companies and at corporate headquarters with the authority of the Board of\nManagement. The audit teams discuss the audit findings and agree on measures for improvement with the audited organizational\nunits and their management. The Board of Management is regularly informed of the findings. The Supervisory Board is provided\nwith a summary once a year.\nThe image presents a table detailing corporate governance-related metrics for a company, focusing on cybersecurity, compliance, and human rights aspects. It provides performance indicators, actual results for 2022 and 2023, and target goals for 2024. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n### Material Topics and Performance Indicators\n- **Cybersecurity**: \n  - **External Rating**: Measured in points. The score was 700 in 2022, increased to 750 in 2023, and the target for 2024 is at least 690.\n- **Compliance**: \n  - **Share of Valid Compliance Training Certificates**: Percentage of employees in middle and upper management who received valid compliance training. It was 98.1% in 2022, increased to 98.6% in 2023, and the target for 2024 is set at 98%.\n- **Respecting Human Rights**: \n  - **Internal Audits by Corporate Internal Audit**: Number of audits conducted.

Performance indicators are steering-relevant and have assigned target values.\n  2. Indicators are relevant for the fiscal year.\n  3. Some indicators are tied to remuneration.\n  4. Specifically mentions that these metrics pertain to middle and upper management.\n\nThis table is a succinct yet detailed portrayal of the company\u2019s efforts in maintaining robust governance through proactive measures in cybersecurity, compliance, and human rights within their operations and supply chain. It highlights the company's commitment to improving and sustaining high standards of governance practices across different domains.\n\nTrusted business partner thanks to compliance culture\nWe render all of our services in compliance with current legislation as well as our corporate values as defined in our Group policies.\nOne important aspect of compliance is the legal requirements relating to preventing corruption and bribery. We observe all\napplicable international anti-corruption standards and statutes and are a member of the Partnering Against Corruption initiative of\nthe World Economic Forum.\nEnsuring legally compliant conduct in our business activities and in our interactions with employees is an essential task of all Group\nmanagement bodies. Our compliance management system (CMS) has been implemented Group-wide. Responsibility for designing\nthe CMS lies with the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CFO. This establishes uniform minimum standards to\nensure compliance with applicable law, for example anti-corruption legislation, and relevant internal guidelines such as the Anti-\nCorruption and Business Ethics Policy (Anti-Corruption Policy). The divisional compliance officers are tasked with the\nimplementation of the CMS within the divisions.\n78 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nWith our Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy, along with training on these topics, we provide clear guidance and help\nemployees identify situations in which the integrity of the company could be called into question.\nParticipation of executives in middle and upper management, as well as of employees in certain functions, in various types of\nrelevant compliance training is mandatory. In this way, we raise our employees\u2019 awareness for potential compliance risks and\nenable them to mitigate such risks in an appropriate manner. The compliance training courses comprise our Core Compliance\nCurriculum (anti-corruption, competition compliance, Code of Conduct) and training on data protection. All employees in the target\ngroup are required to repeat the training courses every two years. We use the share of valid training certificates among executives\nin middle and upper management as a steering-relevant KPI.\nPotential violations can be reported 24/7 \u2013 if legally permitted, anonymously \u2013 via our compliance incident reporting system\n(whistleblower hotline). In addition, potential violations can also be reported by telephone. Third parties can also use the system to\nreport potential violations. Reports are reviewed and investigated internally for potential violations as part of a standardized\nprocess. Key figures on compliance notifications and issues are recorded throughout the Group via the compliance reporting tool\n(BKMS Dashboard). Information on relevant violations is collected and included in the regular compliance reports made to the\nBoard of Management and to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Finance and Audit Committee.\nThe importance and value that compliance has for the Group was once again emphasized for employees by means of a campaign \u2013\nCompliance Awareness Week \u2013 which was rounded out by measures tailored to the specific divisions and regions. The campaign\nwas accompanied by statements from the Board of Management members (\u201ctone from the top\u201d) and supported by panel\ndiscussions with managers. To strengthen the internal dialogue, our workforce was made aware of and informed about compliance\naspects on an ongoing basis by means of further communication measures and via the compliance channels.\nThe compliance training certification rate was 98.6% in middle and upper management in the year under review (previous year:\n98.1%), meaning we exceeded our target of 98% in the year under review. In the context of its 219 audits, Corporate Internal Audit\nalso reviewed compliance management system processes and the implementation of agreed-upon follow-up measures. Findings\nfrom the regular audits facilitate the identification of other compliance risks and the refinement of the compliance program.\nRespecting human rights\nOur commitment to respect for human rights includes adherence to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the International\nLabor Organization (ILO), which we have embedded in our Code of Conduct and outlined in greater detail in our Human Rights\nPolicy Statement. These stipulate clear responsibilities and requirements for our employees and managers as well as our suppliers\nand subcontractors and contribute to the general understanding and implementation of the principles of the UN Global Compact.\nOur human rights activities focus on the prevention of child and forced labor, decent working conditions (working hours,\noccupational health and safety, remuneration), equal opportunities, data protection and the right to freedom of association. With\nthe Supplier Code of Conduct, we obligate suppliers and subcontractors to comply with our ethical, social and environmental\nprinciples and implement them in their own supply chains.\nWith our measures for respecting human rights in the workforce and in the supply chain, we are in compliance with the\nrequirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz \u2013 LkSG). Implementation of the\nmeasures is monitored by the LkSG Council. The board is made up of executives in upper management from the Group functions\nHuman Resources, Corporate Development, Corporate Public Affairs, Legal Services and Global Compliance, Corporate\nProcurement and Corporate Internal Audit.\nAs part of its audits, Corporate Internal Audit also conducted reviews relating to respect for human rights and verified that the\nagreed-upon follow-up measures had been implemented. In the reporting year, 53 such reviews took place.\n79 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nHuman rights in the workforce\nWith our internal management system, we ensure that our Human Rights Policy Statement is implemented among our workforce.\nIn addition, it ensures that we adhere to due diligence requirements. Our management system is comprised of annual as well as ad\nhoc assessments of human rights risks, measures to raise awareness among employees and managers, annual reporting on Group-\nwide fulfillment of due diligence requirements and the professional compliance incident reporting system.\nWe carry out both an abstract and a concrete risk analysis to determine human rights risks. First, the risk is analyzed using external\ndata (Verisk Maplecroft). Then, it is substantiated by evaluating questionnaires completed by our country organizations on the\nbasis of their specific risk profile.\nTargeted on-site reviews are carried out based on the risk assessments. These reviews are conducted by specially trained and\nexternally SMETA-certified (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) professionals from our divisions and corporate headquarters. The\ncountries are selected based on the results of weighting and prioritization of the identified risks, including \u2013 among other factors \u2013\nthe findings from the questionnaires, the number of employees, the assessments of relevant Group committees and responsible\nexperts and recommendations from international trade union confederations. If there are violations identified at locations, these\nare then immediately addressed as part of a structured action plan. In the year under review, on-site reviews under the leadership\nof the HR department were carried out at more than 30 subsidiaries in ten countries, including in Asia, Latin America, Africa and\nEurope.\nWe encourage our employees to participate in the training courses for raising awareness for respect for human rights. Participation\nis mandatory, however, for executives in middle and upper management; the certification rate was 99.5% in the reporting period\n(previous year: 98.4%).\nStandards in the supply chain\nCorporate Procurement selects suppliers that meet our ethical, social and environmental standards. This selection process is based\non a standardized assessment process that also takes aspects such as diversity and respect for human rights into account, as well\nas external criteria such as those from Transparency International (Corruption Perceptions Index) and Verisk Maplecroft. In the year\nunder review, the supplier assessment was supplemented with additional internal measures and expanded with external audits\n(including in accordance with the SMETA method). In the event of findings, remedial measures are discussed and plans for\ncorrective measures are agreed upon.\nProcurement employees are regularly trained to identify potential supplier-related risks early on. We convey our expectations to\nour suppliers and subcontractors via our Supplier Portal and introduce our selection processes. Suppliers can also use our portal to\nfamiliarize themselves with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which we make available in numerous languages along with the\ncorresponding training module. From there, they can also access our professional compliance whistleblower system that they can\nuse to report potential violations of the Code or statutory provisions as well as cybersecurity incidents.\nIn the year under review, we continued developing the Group-wide risk management system for supplier assessments. We\ncalculate the potential for risk of suppliers at the level of purchase categories (material groups). The risk assessment is influenced\nby 46 types of risk within eight risk domains (ESG, economic, technical, legal and political risks, as well as cybersecurity) that are\nevaluated for each individual purchasing category. The ultimate classification of the risk potential is based on the evaluation of the\nprobability and the possible impact. More than 4,000 potential high-risk suppliers were assessed in the year under review\n(previous year: >2,700).\nWe use supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct to measure the successful implementation of our\nstandards in the supply chain. We record progress regarding the key figure via the central financial systems, report to management\non a monthly basis and discuss developments with the CEO and the CFO. In the year under review, supplier spend covered by an\naccepted Supplier Code of Conduct rose to more than \u20ac35 billion (previous year: >\u20ac27 billion).\n80 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nCybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity management activities protect the information of the Group, our business partners and our employees as well as\nIT systems from unauthorized access or manipulation and data misuse. In addition, this ensures uninterrupted availability and\nenables reliable operations. Our internal guidelines and processes are based on ISO 27002 and our data centers are certified in\naccordance with ISO 27001.\nSince January 1, 2024, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO) has reported directly to the CEO (previous year:\nCorporate Board Member for Global Business Services). The IT Board determines the cybersecurity strategy and defines and\nmanages Group-wide measures for cybersecurity, for protecting systems and data and for digitalization processes. The Information\nSecurity Committee is made up of the central functions of Group CISO, IT Audit, Human Resources, Legal Services, Data Protection\nand Corporate Security, as well as the divisional CISOs. The committee assesses potential threats on an ongoing basis, evaluates\nthe potential of new risks and monitors compliance with our security standards.\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can only access the data they need to perform their duties. All\nsystems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. Additionally, by performing\ncontinuous software updates, we can fix potential security vulnerabilities and protect system functionality.\nA variety of communication measures and training sessions help our workforce become more aware of possible cybersecurity risks.\nAll employees and managers with a corporate email address are continuously made aware of risks via phishing simulations. We\nalso draw attention to current risks using IT crisis simulations. Participation in Information Security Awareness training is\nmandatory for all employees with a computer workstation. All participants who have already completed their training must update\ntheir certification every two years.\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This rating is based on the technical\nanalysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company; this is carried out by an\nautomated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables\ncomparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as with\nmajor customers and logistics companies that are not covered by the DAX 40. The target amount is determined by the aspiration to\nbe within the upper quarter of this comparison group.\nThe cybersecurity rating has been remuneration-relevant since this reporting period. This performance indicator makes up 10% of\nthe annual bonus calculation for the Board of Management. As announced, the rating scale for the cybersecurity rating in the year\nunder review has changed due to adjustments to the method of the rating agency. In line with the change, we adjusted our target\nfor the 2023 fiscal year from 710 to 690 points. The rating amounted to 750 of 820 achievable points as of the end of the year\nunder review (previous year: 700 points). The target for the year under review was thus exceeded.\nTax strategy as a standard adhered to worldwide\nOur tax strategy is aligned with our Group strategy and must be adhered to throughout the Group. The overarching approach\napplied by the Group is that taxes are always incidental to and follow business needs.\nWe do not undertake aggressive tax planning or enter into artificial arrangements with the goal of avoiding taxes. Our Group\nmaintains locations in more than 220 countries and territories, including some with lower tax rates than those in Germany. These\nlocations are necessary for carrying out our operational business in those regions. None of our companies was established with the\npurpose of obtaining tax benefits or is currently used to pursue aggressive tax structuring.\nIn interpreting and applying tax legislation, we follow the letter of the law; in case of ambiguity, we follow the law\u2019s spirit and\nintended purpose. As a globally active group of companies, our activities necessarily include operations in countries where\nuncertainty is high. In order to mitigate this uncertainty and obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, we are in\ncontinual dialogue with tax authorities and tax advisers. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in\nwhich we operate. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor\ntax risks and respective countermeasures.\nPursuant to Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as Delegated Regulations\n2021/2178 and 2023/2486 of the European Commission.\nContribution to the climate and environmental objectives of the European Union\nWe report our contribution to the European Union\u2019s (EU) six environmental objectives according to the guidelines laid down in the\nEU Taxonomy regulation and report the taxonomy-aligned (aligned) and taxonomy-eligible shares of revenue, capital expenditure\n(capex) and operating expenditure (opex).\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities (activities) are considered environmentally sustainable and therefore aligned if they make a\nsubstantial contribution to one of the six EU environmental objectives and are not associated with significant harm to one or more\nother environmental objectives (do-no-significant-harm (DNSH) criteria). In addition, for all activities, the Group complies with\nrequired frameworks for minimum safeguards that relate to respecting human rights and social and labor standards, as well as\nanti-corruption fair competition and taxation.\nAligned activities exclusively make a substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 1. No aligned activities were identified\nin conjunction with EU environmental objective 2 that make a substantial contribution to risk avoidance or the reduction of the risk\nof adverse effects of the current and projected climate on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets without increasing the\nrisk of adverse effects on people, nature or assets. The activities in the area of construction and real estate make no substantial\ncontribution to EU environmental objective 4.\nSIX EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES\n1 Climate change mitigation\n2 Climate change adaptation\n3 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n4 Transition to a circular economy\n5 Pollution prevention and control\n6 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe requirements of the EU Taxonomy were expanded in the year under review: new activities in the air freight sector were added\nto the first EU environmental objective, and further activities were added to the EU environmental objectives 3 to 6. The taxonomy\neligibility was determined and reported for these new activities. In accordance with this, we primarily carry out activities in EU\nenvironmental objectives 1 and 2; with regard to EU environmental objective 4, two activities fall under the area of construction\nand real estate.\nThe Group policy for implementing the requirements of the EU Taxonomy includes the guidelines for determining the aligned\nshares of revenue, capex and opex. The data is collected accordingly in the Group-wide finance and controlling systems. In the year\nunder review, the Group policy and the Group-wide finance and controlling systems were adapted with regard to the additional\nrequirements. For the first time, we can now report the taxonomy-eligible shares of our air freight operations.\nDevelopment of the Taxonomy KPIs\nThe taxonomy-eligible and -aligned shares increased compared with the previous year. The expansion of the taxonomy\nrequirements in the area of air freight in particular played a significant role in the increase in taxonomy eligibility. The increase in\ntaxonomy alignment results from our decarbonization measures in the pickup and delivery fleet and the improved identification of\ntaxonomy-aligned activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy still does not take into account all economic activities that are relevant for our business. Revenue from operating\nwarehouses (Supply Chain division) in particular is therefore not reported as taxonomy-eligible.\nCapex generated by the addition of assets can be assigned directly to individual activities, while revenue and opex can generally not\nbe directly assigned. In these cases, we primarily use a cost-based allocation logic that reflects the business models of the divisions.\nWe avoid double counting by assigning revenue, capex and opex to only one activity respectively and taking intra-Group\nrelationships into account on a consolidated basis. Property, plant and equipment from business combinations were primarily\nallocated to the \"Construction and real estate\" and \"Transport\" sectors; intangible assets from business combinations were\nclassified as (cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:91)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:92)(cid:16)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72).\n84 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nDetermining taxonomy alignment\nAll taxonomy-eligible activities were reviewed with regard to their alignment in the year under review. The following statements\nare in regard to the aligned assets per activity and the associated shares of revenue, capex and opex.\nAPPLIED EVALUATION METHOD\nTechnical evaluation criterion Method\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation: Does no Carried out on the basis of individual assets or groups of assets, provided that the\nsignificant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objectives of the evaluation of the criteria is possible on a superordinate level by means of uniform\nsustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Group processes and within the framework of applicable national or EU regulations.\n(DNSH 3), the transition to a circular economy (DNSH 4), pollution These values were assessed as not aligned in all other cases. Various technical\nprevention and control (DNSH 5), the protection and restoration of screening criteria relate to requirements from applicable EU legislation. If no equivalent\nbiodiversity and ecosystems (DNSH 6) requirements apply in non-EU countries, no alignment can be demonstrated\naccordingly.\nDoes no significant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objective The climate-change-related risk assessment was carried out based on the TCFD\nof climate change adaptation (DNSH 2) analysis, which we supplemented with adjustment solutions for physical climate risks.\nEU minimum safeguards for the respect for human rights and the Ensured with our Code of Conduct, the Group policies on anti-corruption and standards\npreserving of employees\u2019 rights, as well as regarding anti-corruption, for business ethics, the environment and energy, the Competition Compliance Policy,\nfair competition and taxation the Human Rights Policy Statement, the corresponding processes and management\nsystems, the regular audits carried out by Corporate Internal Audit and the Group Tax\nStrategy. Ensured in the supply chain with our Supplier Code of Conduct, the\nprocurement processes and supplier management, as well as the implementation of\nthe requirements under the LkSG. At the time this report was prepared, there were no\nrelevant legal proceedings ongoing in this context.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from transport services (transport sector) in collaboration with suppliers and\nsubcontractors, who render their services on an independent basis from a legal perspective. As a result, these activities and the\nassets associated with them must be evaluated there with regard to alignment with the EU Taxonomy. At the time this report was\nprepared, we largely did not have any information on the meeting of technical criteria for these activities and assets, so we are\nreporting them as not taxonomy-aligned, in particular in the activities 6.2, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.10. Even suppliers and subcontractors\nwho report pursuant to the EU Taxonomy were unable to confirm to us the alignment of their underlying activities. If shares of\nrevenue and opex cannot be directly assigned to aligned activities, we apply specific allocation keys \u2013 such as the percentage of\ntaxonomy-aligned vehicles in the entire fleet \u2013 that also take individual characteristics of the divisions into account.\n85 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nthe performance of the world economy and global economic output. Unless otherwise specified, a low relevance is attached to the\nindividual opportunities and risks within the respective categories. The opportunities and risks generally apply to all divisions,\nunless indicated otherwise.\n\n1 Material opportunities and risks are referenced based on the corresponding figures in the following descriptions of individual categories.\nBoth the material as well as the immaterial opportunities and risks from the overview are specified in the following. Unless\notherwise explicitly labeled, these are considered immaterial.\nOpportunities and risks arising from corporate strategy\nOver the past few years, the Group has ensured that its business activities are well positioned in the world\u2019s fastest-growing\nregions and markets. We are also constantly working to create efficient structures in all areas to enable us to flexibly adapt\ncapacities and costs to demand, which is a condition for lasting, profitable business success. With respect to our strategic\norientation, we are focusing on our core competencies in the logistics and letter mail businesses. Our earnings projections regularly\ntake account of development opportunities arising from our strategic orientation.\nWe take action early to counter potential strategic risks. In doing so, it helps that our portfolio of customers and supplier companies\nis as broad as possible and that we focus on profitable sectors and products, regularly review customer and product performance,\npractice strict cost management and add surcharges whenever necessary.\n100 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nIn the Express division, our future success depends, above all, upon general factors such as trends in the competitive environment,\ncosts and quantities transported. In addition, market capacities could restrict our pricing leeway due to market pressure from\ncustomers and competitors, which represents a risk of medium significance for us (1). We plan to keep growing our international\nbusiness and expect a further increase in shipment volumes over the medium and long term. Based upon this assumption, we are\ninvesting in our network, our services, our employees and the DHL brand.\nIn the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we purchase transport services for customers from airlines, shipping companies and\nfreight carriers rather than providing them ourselves. In the best case, we are able to outsource transport services at such a low\nrate that we can generate a margin. In the worst-case scenario, we bear the risk of not being able to pass on all price increases to\nour customers. The extent of our opportunities and risks essentially depends on trends in the supply, demand and pricing of\ntransport services as well as the duration of our contracts. Comprehensive knowledge in the area of brokering transport services\nhelps us to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risk.\nIn the Supply Chain division, our success is highly dependent on our customers\u2019 business performance. Since we offer companies a\nwidely diversified range of products in different sectors all over the world, we are able to diversify our risk portfolio and thus\ncounteract the incumbent risks. Our future success moreover depends on our ability to continuously improve our existing business,\nseamlessly integrate new business and grow in our most important markets and segments.\nThe eCommerce division is responsible for domestic and international non-time-definite standard parcel delivery services in\nvarious countries around the globe. It predominantly serves customers in the fast-growing e-commerce sector. Our goal is to\nleverage our international resources and services to build a cross-border solutions platform that can be connected to the most\ncost-efficient networks for last-mile delivery. We want to grow profitably in all sectors and segments. To counteract the\nfundamental risk of rising cost pressure, we took measures with which we intend to improve network efficiency and cost flexibility.\nWhether e-commerce merchants invest in the establishment and operation of delivery organizations in addition to other market\nparticipants results in opportunities and risks for the eCommerce division, as well as for the parcel business in Germany. In this\nregard, it can be observed that this type of investing activity currently appears to be in decline among e-commerce merchants.\nIn the German mail and parcel business, we are responding to the challenges posed by the structural shift from a physical to a\ndigital business and the continual decline in letter mail occurring parallel to the steady increase in volumes of parcels and\nmerchandise mail items. We are counteracting the risk arising from changing demand by expanding our range of services. Due to\nthe rise in e-commerce, we expect our parcel business to continue growing in the coming years and are therefore expanding our\nnetwork of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing\nas a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible. We follow developments in the\nmarket very closely and take them into account in our earnings projections.\nWe currently do not see any further specific corporate strategy opportunities or risks of material significance, either for the Group\nor individual divisions.\nLegal and compliance-related opportunities and risks\nLegal disputes may arise in the case of noncompliance with national or international laws and regulations as well as agreements.\nExamples are violations of antitrust and competition law. Investigations of any such violations may result in considerable costs,\npenalties and damage to our company\u2019s reputation, which could have a disadvantageous impact on the business activities of the\nGroup.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and agreements is a clearly formulated obligation of all employees of the Group, and ensuring\nthis is one of the fundamental tasks of our managers. To support our employees and managers, we have established a corporate\ncompliance unit differentiated according to relevant topics that, on the basis of our risk management system, monitors compliance\nwith Group-wide standards at both Group and divisional level with respect to typical compliance risks. Thus, in addition to our\ncompliance initiative aimed at preventing fraud and fighting corruption and violations of cartel and competition law, we have\nintroduced initiatives in all divisions intended to ensure compliance with data protection laws \u2013 for example, to ensure adherence to\nthe provisions of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A similar, Group-wide compliance initiative\n101 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\naims to ensure adherence to international and national export controls and embargo regulations. Moreover, our compliance unit\nsupports, coordinates and monitors the observance of human rights and the fundamental environmental standards in our own\noperations as well as in our external supply chain.\nAt present, we do not see any specific legal or compliance-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\nOpportunities and risks arising from capital expenditure and projects\nThe Group invests in maintaining and growing its network, in buildings and technical equipment, in IT solutions and in its fleet of\nvehicles and freight aircraft. The objective of the investment projects is to strengthen the positioning of our divisions in\nconsideration of aspects related to economic efficiency and ESG.\nThe risks associated with the investments relate primarily to deviations in costs and timelines as well as to the complexity of the\nprojects and the availability of resources. This can lead to adverse effects on the economic efficiency, continuity and quality of our\nservices.\nThe aforementioned risks are monitored via ongoing project management and investment controlling so that targeted\ncountermeasures can be taken at an early stage. The status of investment projects is documented on a regular basis and reported\nto the Group Board of Management and, for larger projects, to the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Group Board of Management\nis informed promptly of any critical projects.\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of investment projects.\nOperational opportunities and risks\nLogistics services are generally provided in bulk and require a complex operational and external infrastructure with high quality\nstandards. Any weaknesses with regard to the tendering, sorting, transport, warehousing, customs clearance or delivery of\nshipments could seriously compromise our competitive position. In particular, the impairment of significant infrastructure such as\ncentral transport hubs can have negative effects. To consistently guarantee reliability and punctual delivery, processes must be\norganized so as to proceed smoothly with no technical or personnel-related glitches. We counteract potential operational risks, for\nexample through efficient workflows and structures. We also take out insurance policies to guard against potential losses.\nMost recently, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the global pandemic in recent years, have revealed\nhow external factors can restrict our transport routes and means or reduce the availability of our employees, and hence potentially\nimpair our operating performance. For information on the measures we are taking to protect our employees, please refer to the\ncategories titled \u201cHuman resources\u201d and \u201cEnvironment, catastrophes and epidemics.\u201d\nA large number of internal processes must be aligned so that we can render our services. These include \u2013 in addition to our\nfundamental operating processes \u2013 supporting functions such as sales and purchasing. The extent to which we succeed in aligning\nour internal processes to meet customer needs while simultaneously lowering costs correlates with potential positive deviations\nfrom the current projections. Our earnings projections already incorporate the expected cost savings.\nIncreased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change can be expected in the coming years, including limits on air\ntransport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our business models. The resulting risk represents a risk of\nmedium significance for us currently (2).\nAt this time, we do not see any additional specific operational opportunities or risks of material significance.\n102 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nOpportunities and risks arising from human resources\nQualified, dedicated and motivated employees are a prerequisite for sustainable success. Demographic change and a tense labor\nmarket situation across all job types in some regions represent a challenge for recruiting workers on a local level. To address this\nadequately and to avoid labor shortages, we place particular emphasis on our recruiting activities. In addition, we prevent staff\nshortages through recruiting measures abroad, by using skilled labor migration and by hiring refugees.\nFor our business success and a low level of staff turnover, it is important to provide our employees with development opportunities\nand foster their long-term loyalty to the company. In this context, we value the professional development of our executives, with\nour Group-wide Leadership Attributes serving as a guide for action. Furthermore, we ensure that our employees are able to\ncontinuously improve their skills in line with their needs through on-the-job learning opportunities as well as off-the-job training\ncourses.\nThe health and safety of our employees are of central importance for DHL Group. We therefore place a high value on health and\noccupational safety measures. With respect to occupational health, we make use of initiatives tailored to local requirements and\ncooperate across divisions in the management of healthcare initiatives. This is supplemented with health and exercise programs\nand targeted checkup offers on-site. In addition, we address risks in the area of mental health using prevention, including by means\nof a continuously refined system for assessing risks associated with mental stresses and as part of our Certified programs for staff\ndevelopment.\nAs a globally active company with approximately 590,000 employees (headcount as of December 31, 2023) in over 220 countries\nand territories, upholding human rights is a top priority for us. We account for this responsibility through our Human Rights Policy\nStatement. If infringements are reported, we will take appropriate measures for clarification.\nThe development of staff costs is a key factor for us due to the large number of employees. This factor is also being driven by the\ncurrently high levels of inflation. The current collective bargaining agreement of Deutsche Post AG is valid for 2023 and 2024. The\ndevelopment of staff costs is no longer a risk of material significance for us at this time.\nOverall, we do not currently see any personnel-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\nOpportunities and risks arising from information technology\nThe security of our information systems is particularly important to us. The goal is to ensure continuous IT system operation and\nprevent unauthorized access to our systems and databases. To this end, we have defined guidelines, standards and procedures\nbased upon ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management. In addition, IT risks are monitored and\nassessed on an ongoing basis by Group Risk Management, Corporate Internal Audit, Data Protection and Corporate Security.\nFor our business processes to run smoothly at all times, the essential IT systems must be continuously available. We have therefore\ndesigned our systems to protect against complete system failure. Our software is monitored and updated regularly to address\npotential bugs, close gaps in security and increase functionality. We employ a patch management process \u2013 a defined procedure for\nmanaging software upgrades \u2013 to control risks that could arise from outdated software or from software upgrades. In this context,\nwe use structured processes to collect and check the devices and software versions used in our IT network, the goal being to\nachieve the highest possible level of coverage.\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can generally only access the data they need to perform their duties.\nSystems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. We make use of outsourced\ndata centers of established providers and operate central data centers in the Czech Republic, Malaysia and the United States. Our\nsystems are thus geographically separate and, in addition, are replicated at local disaster recovery locations.\n103 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nGOVERNANCE\nAnnual Corporate Governance Statement\npursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB with respect to Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG and DHL Group.\nDeclaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\nDeutsche Post(cid:3)AG complied with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year\nunder review. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board intend to comply with all suggestions and recommendations in\nthe future as well. In December(cid:3)2023, they issued the following Declaration of Conformity:\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG declare that, since the issue of the Declaration of\nConformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code, as\namended on April 28, 2022, and published in the (cid:291)(cid:336)(cid:329)(cid:319)(cid:320)(cid:334)(cid:316)(cid:329)(cid:341)(cid:320)(cid:324)(cid:322)(cid:320)(cid:333) (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, have been complied with,\nand that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward.\nYou can view the current Declaration of Conformity and the Annual Corporate Governance Statement along with the Declarations\nof Conformity for the past five years on the company\u2019s website.\nCorporate governance principles and shared values\nOur business relationships and activities are based upon responsible business practices that comply with applicable laws,\ninternational guidelines and ethical standards, and this also forms part of the Group\u2019s strategy. Equally, we require our suppliers to\nact in this way. We encourage relationships with our employees, customers and other stakeholders, as well as the shareholders,\nwhose decisions to select DHL Group as an employer, supplier or investment are increasingly also based upon the requirement that\nwe apply good corporate governance criteria.\nWith the Code of Conduct, we have laid out the requirements of the conduct of our employees. It is applicable across all divisions and\nregions. In the Code of Conduct, we commit ourselves in particular to the principles set out in the United Nations (UN) Global\nCompact, comply with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and follow additional recognized legal\nstandards, including the applicable anti-corruption legislation and agreements. In addition, we take the International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational\nEnterprises into account. In addition, we support various sustainability initiatives, for example to promote the development of\nsustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of\ngreenhouse gases. As a long-standing partner of the United Nations, we support the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIn 2023, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\nThe Code of Conduct also describes our understanding of diversity and inclusion. This understanding and mutual respect promote\ncooperation within the Group and thus contribute to economic success. The criteria for the recruitment and professional\ndevelopment of our employees are exclusively their skills and qualifications. The members of the Board of Management and the\nSupervisory Board support the diversity measures, with a particular focus on the Group\u2019s goal of increasing the number of women\nin management. Doing business includes using our expertise as a service provider in the mail services and logistics sector for the\nbenefit of society and the environment, and we motivate our employees to engage personally in this regard.\nEnsuring that our interactions with business partners, shareholders and the public are conducted with integrity and within the\nbounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation. This is also the foundation of DHL Group\u2019s lasting business success. Our\ncompliance management system (CMS) is designed to promote legally compliant conduct as well as to prevent corruption and\nanticompetitive conduct in particular. Insights gained from compliance audits and reported violations are also used to continually\nimprove and upgrade the CMS system. To this end, the enhanced compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard) offers Group-wide,\n112 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\ncentralized and systematic collection of all key figures related to compliance notifications and the clarification of issues. In addition,\nfurther measures were taken to promote the culture of compliance and compliance reporting was established.\nCooperation between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, remuneration, retirement ages\nAs a listed German public limited company, Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG has a two-tier board structure comprising the Board of Management\nand the Supervisory Board.\nMembers of the Board of Management are responsible for the management of the company. They manage their Board\ndepartments independently, except where decisions of particular significance and consequence for the company or the Group\nrequire a resolution by all members of the Board of Management. Each member of the Board of Management is obligated to\nsubordinate the interests of their individual Board departments to the collective interests of the company and to inform the Board\nof Management about significant developments in their departments. The Board of Management ensures compliance with\nstatutory provisions and internal guidelines within the company (compliance). The internal control system and the risk\nmanagement system comprise a CMS aligned with the risk situation of the company and also include targets related to\nsustainability.\nThe CEO conducts Board of Management business, aligns Board department activities with the company\u2019s collective goals and\nplans, and ensures that corporate policy is carried out. When making decisions, members of the Board of Management may not act\nin their own personal interest or exploit corporate business opportunities for their own benefit. Any conflicts of interest must be\ndisclosed to the chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management without delay; the other Board of Management\nmembers must also be informed. The Supervisory Board has determined that appointments to the Board of Management should\ngenerally end by the time the member turns 65.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board appoint, advise and oversee the Board of Management. They propose the remuneration\nsystem for Board of Management members to the Annual General Meeting, and \u2013 together with the Board of Management \u2013 are\njointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. Furthermore, the statutory obligations of\nthe Supervisory Board include the review and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the review of the\nproposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit and the recommendation of the auditor to the Annual General Meeting.\nFor proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board will ensure that their term of office ends no\nlater than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member turns 72. As a general rule,\nSupervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\nThe company\u2019s D & O (directors and officers) insurance for the members of the Board of Management provides for a deductible as\nset out in the AktG.\nThe principles governing the Supervisory Board\u2019s internal organization, a catalog of Board of Management transactions requiring\napproval and the work of the Supervisory Board committees are governed by the rules of procedure, which are available on the\ncompany\u2019s website. The Chair, elected by the members of the Supervisory Board from their ranks, coordinates the work of the\nSupervisory Board and represents the Supervisory Board publicly. The Chair holds talks with investors on topics relevant to the\nSupervisory Board. The Supervisory Board represents the company in respect of the Board of Management members. Members of\nthe Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual remuneration of \u20ac100,000. The remuneration for each of the chairs (plenary and\ncommittees) increases by 100%, for the Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and for committee members by 50%. This does not\napply to the Mediation or Nomination Committees. The report on remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board\nmembers can be accessed along with the auditor\u2019s report pursuant to Section 162(3) AktG on the company\u2019s website. There are no\ncontracts between the company and Supervisory Board members, with the exception of the employment contracts with the\nemployee representatives.\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least twice each half year, regularly also without the Board of Management present. Extraordinary\nmeetings are held as required. In the 2023 fiscal year, Supervisory Board members held four plenary meetings, 21 committee\nmeetings and one closed meeting. The meetings took place in person, with a few exceptions for the committee meetings. Individual\n113 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nmembers joined via videoconference. In cases where individual members were unable to participate, they submitted their votes in\nwriting in advance of the meeting and thus ensured that the decisions made were based on the decisions of all responsible\nmembers. The overall attendance rate of 95% is broken down by member in the report of the Supervisory Board.\nSupervisory Board decisions are prepared in advance in separate meetings of the shareholder representatives and the employee\nrepresentatives, and by the relevant committees. During the plenary meetings, the committee chairs inform the other members\nabout the work and decisions of the committees. Supervisory Board members are personally responsible for ensuring they receive\ntraining and professional development measures. They receive appropriate support from the company in the process. In 2023, the\nDirectors\u2019 Days took place in May and September. The topics covered included the regulation of the postal market, ESG key\nperformance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply\nchain legislation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting and the EU Taxonomy.\nSuccession planning for the Board of Management\nTogether with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the\nBoard of Management. To this end, in particular the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly discuss\ncandidates with the potential to take on positions on the Board of Management. Within the Supervisory Board, the search for\nsuitable Board of Management members is primarily the responsibility of the Executive Committee. In the event of an upcoming\nvacancy, the Executive Committee selects suitable candidates for personal interviews, taking into account specific requirements for\nexperience and qualifications to be met by the members and the composition of the Board of Management as a whole and, after\ndiscussing this list of candidates, submits it to the Supervisory Board.\nIndependent of specific upcoming vacancies, potential successors from within the Group are given the opportunity to give a\npresentation on topics from their own areas of responsibility before the Supervisory Board. In this way, the Supervisory Board\nmaintains an overview of the potential of Group executives who could be considered for a position on the Board of Management.\nWhen appointing new members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board ensures that the different skills and\nexperiences of the members supplement the Board of Management and that its membership is thus diverse. International\nexperience is of particular importance, in addition to industry experience. The initial term of service for members of the Board of\nManagement generally runs for three years.\nIndependence of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\nAll Supervisory Board members are independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code. This exceeds the\ntarget for the Supervisory Board of filling at least 60% of mandates on the shareholder side with independent members.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest shareholder in the company, KfW Bankengruppe, holds 20.49% of the shares in Deutsche\nPost(cid:3)AG and therefore does not exercise control, nor does the German federal government, which is an indirect shareholder via the\nKfW. Accordingly, Luise H\u00f6lscher and Stefan B. Wintels are also independent. On February 7, 2024, KfW Bankengruppe reduced its\nshareholding in Deutsche Post AG to 16.45%.\nStefan Schulte, who is resigning from the Supervisory Board after the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 3, 2024, has\ncontributed his comprehensive expertise and experience to the benefit of the company throughout his term of office and, as the\nChair of the Financial and Audit Committee, engaged the Board of Management in differentiated and critical discussions. His\nindependence was therefore not in question at any time for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will recommend two\nnew independent Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting to succeed Stefan Schulte and Simone Menne, who\nis also stepping down from the Finance and Audit Committee. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the\nreport of the Supervisory Board.\nLawrence Rosen\u2019s responsibility for the Board department Finance ended more than seven years ago and therefore does not impair\nhis independence. At the same time, his profound knowledge of the company and the industry make it possible for him to support\nthe Board of Management as an experienced and expert adviser and to perform the monitoring duties of the Supervisory Board in\nparticular.\n114 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

Our focus at all times is on preventing potential violations of statutory\nrequirements and internal guidelines.\nCorporate Internal Audit evaluates the effectiveness of our risk management system, control mechanisms, management and\nmonitoring processes and compliance with Group policies, contributing to their improvement. It does this by performing\nindependent regular and ad hoc audits at all Group companies and at corporate headquarters with the authority of the Board of\nManagement. The audit teams discuss the audit findings and agree on measures for improvement with the audited organizational\nunits and their management. The Board of Management is regularly informed of the findings. The Supervisory Board is provided\nwith a summary once a year.\nThe image presents a table detailing corporate governance-related metrics for a company, focusing on cybersecurity, compliance, and human rights aspects. It provides performance indicators, actual results for 2022 and 2023, and target goals for 2024. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n### Material Topics and Performance Indicators\n- **Cybersecurity**: \n  - **External Rating**: Measured in points. The score was 700 in 2022, increased to 750 in 2023, and the target for 2024 is at least 690.\n- **Compliance**: \n  - **Share of Valid Compliance Training Certificates**: Percentage of employees in middle and upper management who received valid compliance training. It was 98.1% in 2022, increased to 98.6% in 2023, and the target for 2024 is set at 98%.\n- **Respecting Human Rights**: \n  - **Internal Audits by Corporate Internal Audit**: Number of audits conducted. There were 33 in 2022 and 53 in 2023. No target is specified for 2024.\n  - **On-Site Reviews**: Indicates the number of countries where these were carried out, consistent at 10 for both years.\n  - **Share of Valid Training Certificates in Middle and Upper Management**: Percentage increased from 98.4% in 2022 to 99.5% in 2023.\n- **Supply Chain Standards**:\n  - **Supplier Spend Covered by an Accepted Supplier Code of Conduct**: Financial commitment in billions to suppliers adhering to accepted codes of conduct, rising from over 27 billion in 2022 to over 35 billion in 2023.\n  - **Potential High-Risk Suppliers Assessed**: The number of suppliers assessed for high risks increased significantly from over 2,700 in 2022 to over 4,000 in 2023.\n\n### Footnotes\n- Several footnotes provide additional context:\n  1. Performance indicators are steering-relevant and have assigned target values.\n  2. Indicators are relevant for the fiscal year.\n  3. Some indicators are tied to remuneration.\n  4. Specifically mentions that these metrics pertain to middle and upper management.\n\nThis table is a succinct yet detailed portrayal of the company\u2019s efforts in maintaining robust governance through proactive measures in cybersecurity, compliance, and human rights within their operations and supply chain. It highlights the company's commitment to improving and sustaining high standards of governance practices across different domains.\n\nTrusted business partner thanks to compliance culture\nWe render all of our services in compliance with current legislation as well as our corporate values as defined in our Group policies.\nOne important aspect of compliance is the legal requirements relating to preventing corruption and bribery. We observe all\napplicable international anti-corruption standards and statutes and are a member of the Partnering Against Corruption initiative of\nthe World Economic Forum.\nEnsuring legally compliant conduct in our business activities and in our interactions with employees is an essential task of all Group\nmanagement bodies. Our compliance management system (CMS) has been implemented Group-wide. Responsibility for designing\nthe CMS lies with the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CFO. This establishes uniform minimum standards to\nensure compliance with applicable law, for example anti-corruption legislation, and relevant internal guidelines such as the Anti-\nCorruption and Business Ethics Policy (Anti-Corruption Policy). The divisional compliance officers are tasked with the\nimplementation of the CMS within the divisions.\n78 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nWith our Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy, along with training on these topics, we provide clear guidance and help\nemployees identify situations in which the integrity of the company could be called into question.\nParticipation of executives in middle and upper management, as well as of employees in certain functions, in various types of\nrelevant compliance training is mandatory. In this way, we raise our employees\u2019 awareness for potential compliance risks and\nenable them to mitigate such risks in an appropriate manner. The compliance training courses comprise our Core Compliance\nCurriculum (anti-corruption, competition compliance, Code of Conduct) and training on data protection. All employees in the target\ngroup are required to repeat the training courses every two years. We use the share of valid training certificates among executives\nin middle and upper management as a steering-relevant KPI.\nPotential violations can be reported 24/7 \u2013 if legally permitted, anonymously \u2013 via our compliance incident reporting system\n(whistleblower hotline). In addition, potential violations can also be reported by telephone. Third parties can also use the system to\nreport potential violations. Reports are reviewed and investigated internally for potential violations as part of a standardized\nprocess. Key figures on compliance notifications and issues are recorded throughout the Group via the compliance reporting tool\n(BKMS Dashboard). Information on relevant violations is collected and included in the regular compliance reports made to the\nBoard of Management and to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Finance and Audit Committee.\nThe importance and value that compliance has for the Group was once again emphasized for employees by means of a campaign \u2013\nCompliance Awareness Week \u2013 which was rounded out by measures tailored to the specific divisions and regions. The campaign\nwas accompanied by statements from the Board of Management members (\u201ctone from the top\u201d) and supported by panel\ndiscussions with managers. To strengthen the internal dialogue, our workforce was made aware of and informed about compliance\naspects on an ongoing basis by means of further communication measures and via the compliance channels.\nThe compliance training certification rate was 98.6% in middle and upper management in the year under review (previous year:\n98.1%), meaning we exceeded our target of 98% in the year under review. In the context of its 219 audits, Corporate Internal Audit\nalso reviewed compliance management system processes and the implementation of agreed-upon follow-up measures. Findings\nfrom the regular audits facilitate the identification of other compliance risks and the refinement of the compliance program.\nRespecting human rights\nOur commitment to respect for human rights includes adherence to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the International\nLabor Organization (ILO), which we have embedded in our Code of Conduct and outlined in greater detail in our Human Rights\nPolicy Statement. These stipulate clear responsibilities and requirements for our employees and managers as well as our suppliers\nand subcontractors and contribute to the general understanding and implementation of the principles of the UN Global Compact.\nOur human rights activities focus on the prevention of child and forced labor, decent working conditions (working hours,\noccupational health and safety, remuneration), equal opportunities, data protection and the right to freedom of association. With\nthe Supplier Code of Conduct, we obligate suppliers and subcontractors to comply with our ethical, social and environmental\nprinciples and implement them in their own supply chains.\nWith our measures for respecting human rights in the workforce and in the supply chain, we are in compliance with the\nrequirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz \u2013 LkSG). Implementation of the\nmeasures is monitored by the LkSG Council. The board is made up of executives in upper management from the Group functions\nHuman Resources, Corporate Development, Corporate Public Affairs, Legal Services and Global Compliance, Corporate\nProcurement and Corporate Internal Audit.\nAs part of its audits, Corporate Internal Audit also conducted reviews relating to respect for human rights and verified that the\nagreed-upon follow-up measures had been implemented. In the reporting year, 53 such reviews took place.\n79 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nHuman rights in the workforce\nWith our internal management system, we ensure that our Human Rights Policy Statement is implemented among our workforce.\nIn addition, it ensures that we adhere to due diligence requirements. Our management system is comprised of annual as well as ad\nhoc assessments of human rights risks, measures to raise awareness among employees and managers, annual reporting on Group-\nwide fulfillment of due diligence requirements and the professional compliance incident reporting system.\nWe carry out both an abstract and a concrete risk analysis to determine human rights risks. First, the risk is analyzed using external\ndata (Verisk Maplecroft). Then, it is substantiated by evaluating questionnaires completed by our country organizations on the\nbasis of their specific risk profile.\nTargeted on-site reviews are carried out based on the risk assessments. These reviews are conducted by specially trained and\nexternally SMETA-certified (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) professionals from our divisions and corporate headquarters. The\ncountries are selected based on the results of weighting and prioritization of the identified risks, including \u2013 among other factors \u2013\nthe findings from the questionnaires, the number of employees, the assessments of relevant Group committees and responsible\nexperts and recommendations from international trade union confederations. If there are violations identified at locations, these\nare then immediately addressed as part of a structured action plan. In the year under review, on-site reviews under the leadership\nof the HR department were carried out at more than 30 subsidiaries in ten countries, including in Asia, Latin America, Africa and\nEurope.\nWe encourage our employees to participate in the training courses for raising awareness for respect for human rights. Participation\nis mandatory, however, for executives in middle and upper management; the certification rate was 99.5% in the reporting period\n(previous year: 98.4%).\nStandards in the supply chain\nCorporate Procurement selects suppliers that meet our ethical, social and environmental standards. This selection process is based\non a standardized assessment process that also takes aspects such as diversity and respect for human rights into account, as well\nas external criteria such as those from Transparency International (Corruption Perceptions Index) and Verisk Maplecroft. In the year\nunder review, the supplier assessment was supplemented with additional internal measures and expanded with external audits\n(including in accordance with the SMETA method). In the event of findings, remedial measures are discussed and plans for\ncorrective measures are agreed upon.\nProcurement employees are regularly trained to identify potential supplier-related risks early on. We convey our expectations to\nour suppliers and subcontractors via our Supplier Portal and introduce our selection processes. Suppliers can also use our portal to\nfamiliarize themselves with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which we make available in numerous languages along with the\ncorresponding training module. From there, they can also access our professional compliance whistleblower system that they can\nuse to report potential violations of the Code or statutory provisions as well as cybersecurity incidents.\nIn the year under review, we continued developing the Group-wide risk management system for supplier assessments. We\ncalculate the potential for risk of suppliers at the level of purchase categories (material groups). The risk assessment is influenced\nby 46 types of risk within eight risk domains (ESG, economic, technical, legal and political risks, as well as cybersecurity) that are\nevaluated for each individual purchasing category. The ultimate classification of the risk potential is based on the evaluation of the\nprobability and the possible impact. More than 4,000 potential high-risk suppliers were assessed in the year under review\n(previous year: >2,700).\nWe use supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct to measure the successful implementation of our\nstandards in the supply chain. We record progress regarding the key figure via the central financial systems, report to management\non a monthly basis and discuss developments with the CEO and the CFO. In the year under review, supplier spend covered by an\naccepted Supplier Code of Conduct rose to more than \u20ac35 billion (previous year: >\u20ac27 billion).\n80 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nCybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity management activities protect the information of the Group, our business partners and our employees as well as\nIT systems from unauthorized access or manipulation and data misuse. In addition, this ensures uninterrupted availability and\nenables reliable operations. Our internal guidelines and processes are based on ISO 27002 and our data centers are certified in\naccordance with ISO 27001.\nSince January 1, 2024, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO) has reported directly to the CEO (previous year:\nCorporate Board Member for Global Business Services). The IT Board determines the cybersecurity strategy and defines and\nmanages Group-wide measures for cybersecurity, for protecting systems and data and for digitalization processes. The Information\nSecurity Committee is made up of the central functions of Group CISO, IT Audit, Human Resources, Legal Services, Data Protection\nand Corporate Security, as well as the divisional CISOs. The committee assesses potential threats on an ongoing basis, evaluates\nthe potential of new risks and monitors compliance with our security standards.\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can only access the data they need to perform their duties. All\nsystems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. Additionally, by performing\ncontinuous software updates, we can fix potential security vulnerabilities and protect system functionality.\nA variety of communication measures and training sessions help our workforce become more aware of possible cybersecurity risks.\nAll employees and managers with a corporate email address are continuously made aware of risks via phishing simulations. We\nalso draw attention to current risks using IT crisis simulations. Participation in Information Security Awareness training is\nmandatory for all employees with a computer workstation. All participants who have already completed their training must update\ntheir certification every two years.\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This rating is based on the technical\nanalysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company; this is carried out by an\nautomated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables\ncomparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as with\nmajor customers and logistics companies that are not covered by the DAX 40. The target amount is determined by the aspiration to\nbe within the upper quarter of this comparison group.\nThe cybersecurity rating has been remuneration-relevant since this reporting period. This performance indicator makes up 10% of\nthe annual bonus calculation for the Board of Management. As announced, the rating scale for the cybersecurity rating in the year\nunder review has changed due to adjustments to the method of the rating agency. In line with the change, we adjusted our target\nfor the 2023 fiscal year from 710 to 690 points. The rating amounted to 750 of 820 achievable points as of the end of the year\nunder review (previous year: 700 points). The target for the year under review was thus exceeded.\nTax strategy as a standard adhered to worldwide\nOur tax strategy is aligned with our Group strategy and must be adhered to throughout the Group. The overarching approach\napplied by the Group is that taxes are always incidental to and follow business needs.\nWe do not undertake aggressive tax planning or enter into artificial arrangements with the goal of avoiding taxes. Our Group\nmaintains locations in more than 220 countries and territories, including some with lower tax rates than those in Germany. These\nlocations are necessary for carrying out our operational business in those regions. None of our companies was established with the\npurpose of obtaining tax benefits or is currently used to pursue aggressive tax structuring.\nIn interpreting and applying tax legislation, we follow the letter of the law; in case of ambiguity, we follow the law\u2019s spirit and\nintended purpose. As a globally active group of companies, our activities necessarily include operations in countries where\nuncertainty is high. In order to mitigate this uncertainty and obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, we are in\ncontinual dialogue with tax authorities and tax advisers. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in\nwhich we operate. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor\ntax risks and respective countermeasures.\nPursuant to Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as Delegated Regulations\n2021/2178 and 2023/2486 of the European Commission.\nContribution to the climate and environmental objectives of the European Union\nWe report our contribution to the European Union\u2019s (EU) six environmental objectives according to the guidelines laid down in the\nEU Taxonomy regulation and report the taxonomy-aligned (aligned) and taxonomy-eligible shares of revenue, capital expenditure\n(capex) and operating expenditure (opex).\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities (activities) are considered environmentally sustainable and therefore aligned if they make a\nsubstantial contribution to one of the six EU environmental objectives and are not associated with significant harm to one or more\nother environmental objectives (do-no-significant-harm (DNSH) criteria). In addition, for all activities, the Group complies with\nrequired frameworks for minimum safeguards that relate to respecting human rights and social and labor standards, as well as\nanti-corruption fair competition and taxation.\nAligned activities exclusively make a substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 1. No aligned activities were identified\nin conjunction with EU environmental objective 2 that make a substantial contribution to risk avoidance or the reduction of the risk\nof adverse effects of the current and projected climate on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets without increasing the\nrisk of adverse effects on people, nature or assets. The activities in the area of construction and real estate make no substantial\ncontribution to EU environmental objective 4.\nSIX EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES\n1 Climate change mitigation\n2 Climate change adaptation\n3 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n4 Transition to a circular economy\n5 Pollution prevention and control\n6 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe requirements of the EU Taxonomy were expanded in the year under review: new activities in the air freight sector were added\nto the first EU environmental objective, and further activities were added to the EU environmental objectives 3 to 6. The taxonomy\neligibility was determined and reported for these new activities. In accordance with this, we primarily carry out activities in EU\nenvironmental objectives 1 and 2; with regard to EU environmental objective 4, two activities fall under the area of construction\nand real estate.\nThe Group policy for implementing the requirements of the EU Taxonomy includes the guidelines for determining the aligned\nshares of revenue, capex and opex. The data is collected accordingly in the Group-wide finance and controlling systems. In the year\nunder review, the Group policy and the Group-wide finance and controlling systems were adapted with regard to the additional\nrequirements. For the first time, we can now report the taxonomy-eligible shares of our air freight operations.\nDevelopment of the Taxonomy KPIs\nThe taxonomy-eligible and -aligned shares increased compared with the previous year. The expansion of the taxonomy\nrequirements in the area of air freight in particular played a significant role in the increase in taxonomy eligibility. The increase in\ntaxonomy alignment results from our decarbonization measures in the pickup and delivery fleet and the improved identification of\ntaxonomy-aligned activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy still does not take into account all economic activities that are relevant for our business. Revenue from operating\nwarehouses (Supply Chain division) in particular is therefore not reported as taxonomy-eligible.\nCapex generated by the addition of assets can be assigned directly to individual activities, while revenue and opex can generally not\nbe directly assigned. In these cases, we primarily use a cost-based allocation logic that reflects the business models of the divisions.\nWe avoid double counting by assigning revenue, capex and opex to only one activity respectively and taking intra-Group\nrelationships into account on a consolidated basis. Property, plant and equipment from business combinations were primarily\nallocated to the \"Construction and real estate\" and \"Transport\" sectors; intangible assets from business combinations were\nclassified as (cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:91)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:92)(cid:16)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72).\n84 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nDetermining taxonomy alignment\nAll taxonomy-eligible activities were reviewed with regard to their alignment in the year under review. The following statements\nare in regard to the aligned assets per activity and the associated shares of revenue, capex and opex.\nAPPLIED EVALUATION METHOD\nTechnical evaluation criterion Method\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation: Does no Carried out on the basis of individual assets or groups of assets, provided that the\nsignificant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objectives of the evaluation of the criteria is possible on a superordinate level by means of uniform\nsustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Group processes and within the framework of applicable national or EU regulations.\n(DNSH 3), the transition to a circular economy (DNSH 4), pollution These values were assessed as not aligned in all other cases. Various technical\nprevention and control (DNSH 5), the protection and restoration of screening criteria relate to requirements from applicable EU legislation. If no equivalent\nbiodiversity and ecosystems (DNSH 6) requirements apply in non-EU countries, no alignment can be demonstrated\naccordingly.\nDoes no significant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objective The climate-change-related risk assessment was carried out based on the TCFD\nof climate change adaptation (DNSH 2) analysis, which we supplemented with adjustment solutions for physical climate risks.\nEU minimum safeguards for the respect for human rights and the Ensured with our Code of Conduct, the Group policies on anti-corruption and standards\npreserving of employees\u2019 rights, as well as regarding anti-corruption, for business ethics, the environment and energy, the Competition Compliance Policy,\nfair competition and taxation the Human Rights Policy Statement, the corresponding processes and management\nsystems, the regular audits carried out by Corporate Internal Audit and the Group Tax\nStrategy. Ensured in the supply chain with our Supplier Code of Conduct, the\nprocurement processes and supplier management, as well as the implementation of\nthe requirements under the LkSG. At the time this report was prepared, there were no\nrelevant legal proceedings ongoing in this context.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from transport services (transport sector) in collaboration with suppliers and\nsubcontractors, who render their services on an independent basis from a legal perspective. As a result, these activities and the\nassets associated with them must be evaluated there with regard to alignment with the EU Taxonomy. At the time this report was\nprepared, we largely did not have any information on the meeting of technical criteria for these activities and assets, so we are\nreporting them as not taxonomy-aligned, in particular in the activities 6.2, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.10. Even suppliers and subcontractors\nwho report pursuant to the EU Taxonomy were unable to confirm to us the alignment of their underlying activities. If shares of\nrevenue and opex cannot be directly assigned to aligned activities, we apply specific allocation keys \u2013 such as the percentage of\ntaxonomy-aligned vehicles in the entire fleet \u2013 that also take individual characteristics of the divisions into account.\n85 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nthe performance of the world economy and global economic output. Unless otherwise specified, a low relevance is attached to the\nindividual opportunities and risks within the respective categories. The opportunities and risks generally apply to all divisions,\nunless indicated otherwise.\n\n1 Material opportunities and risks are referenced based on the corresponding figures in the following descriptions of individual categories.\nBoth the material as well as the immaterial opportunities and risks from the overview are specified in the following. Unless\notherwise explicitly labeled, these are considered immaterial.\nOpportunities and risks arising from corporate strategy\nOver the past few years, the Group has ensured that its business activities are well positioned in the world\u2019s fastest-growing\nregions and markets. We are also constantly working to create efficient structures in all areas to enable us to flexibly adapt\ncapacities and costs to demand, which is a condition for lasting, profitable business success. With respect to our strategic\norientation, we are focusing on our core competencies in the logistics and letter mail businesses. Our earnings projections regularly\ntake account of development opportunities arising from our strategic orientation.\nWe take action early to counter potential strategic risks. In doing so, it helps that our portfolio of customers and supplier companies\nis as broad as possible and that we focus on profitable sectors and products, regularly review customer and product performance,\npractice strict cost management and add surcharges whenever necessary.\n100 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nIn the Express division, our future success depends, above all, upon general factors such as trends in the competitive environment,\ncosts and quantities transported. In addition, market capacities could restrict our pricing leeway due to market pressure from\ncustomers and competitors, which represents a risk of medium significance for us (1). We plan to keep growing our international\nbusiness and expect a further increase in shipment volumes over the medium and long term. Based upon this assumption, we are\ninvesting in our network, our services, our employees and the DHL brand.\nIn the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we purchase transport services for customers from airlines, shipping companies and\nfreight carriers rather than providing them ourselves. In the best case, we are able to outsource transport services at such a low\nrate that we can generate a margin. In the worst-case scenario, we bear the risk of not being able to pass on all price increases to\nour customers. The extent of our opportunities and risks essentially depends on trends in the supply, demand and pricing of\ntransport services as well as the duration of our contracts. Comprehensive knowledge in the area of brokering transport services\nhelps us to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risk.\nIn the Supply Chain division, our success is highly dependent on our customers\u2019 business performance. Since we offer companies a\nwidely diversified range of products in different sectors all over the world, we are able to diversify our risk portfolio and thus\ncounteract the incumbent risks. Our future success moreover depends on our ability to continuously improve our existing business,\nseamlessly integrate new business and grow in our most important markets and segments.\nThe eCommerce division is responsible for domestic and international non-time-definite standard parcel delivery services in\nvarious countries around the globe. It predominantly serves customers in the fast-growing e-commerce sector. Our goal is to\nleverage our international resources and services to build a cross-border solutions platform that can be connected to the most\ncost-efficient networks for last-mile delivery. We want to grow profitably in all sectors and segments. To counteract the\nfundamental risk of rising cost pressure, we took measures with which we intend to improve network efficiency and cost flexibility.\nWhether e-commerce merchants invest in the establishment and operation of delivery organizations in addition to other market\nparticipants results in opportunities and risks for the eCommerce division, as well as for the parcel business in Germany. In this\nregard, it can be observed that this type of investing activity currently appears to be in decline among e-commerce merchants.\nIn the German mail and parcel business, we are responding to the challenges posed by the structural shift from a physical to a\ndigital business and the continual decline in letter mail occurring parallel to the steady increase in volumes of parcels and\nmerchandise mail items. We are counteracting the risk arising from changing demand by expanding our range of services. Due to\nthe rise in e-commerce, we expect our parcel business to continue growing in the coming years and are therefore expanding our\nnetwork of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing\nas a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible. We follow developments in the\nmarket very closely and take them into account in our earnings projections.\nWe currently do not see any further specific corporate strategy opportunities or risks of material significance, either for the Group\nor individual divisions.\nLegal and compliance-related opportunities and risks\nLegal disputes may arise in the case of noncompliance with national or international laws and regulations as well as agreements.\nExamples are violations of antitrust and competition law. Investigations of any such violations may result in considerable costs,\npenalties and damage to our company\u2019s reputation, which could have a disadvantageous impact on the business activities of the\nGroup.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and agreements is a clearly formulated obligation of all employees of the Group, and ensuring\nthis is one of the fundamental tasks of our managers. To support our employees and managers, we have established a corporate\ncompliance unit differentiated according to relevant topics that, on the basis of our risk management system, monitors compliance\nwith Group-wide standards at both Group and divisional level with respect to typical compliance risks. Thus, in addition to our\ncompliance initiative aimed at preventing fraud and fighting corruption and violations of cartel and competition law, we have\nintroduced initiatives in all divisions intended to ensure compliance with data protection laws \u2013 for example, to ensure adherence to\nthe provisions of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A similar, Group-wide compliance initiative\n101 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\naims to ensure adherence to international and national export controls and embargo regulations. Moreover, our compliance unit\nsupports, coordinates and monitors the observance of human rights and the fundamental environmental standards in our own\noperations as well as in our external supply chain.\nAt present, we do not see any specific legal or compliance-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\nOpportunities and risks arising from capital expenditure and projects\nThe Group invests in maintaining and growing its network, in buildings and technical equipment, in IT solutions and in its fleet of\nvehicles and freight aircraft. The objective of the investment projects is to strengthen the positioning of our divisions in\nconsideration of aspects related to economic efficiency and ESG.\nThe risks associated with the investments relate primarily to deviations in costs and timelines as well as to the complexity of the\nprojects and the availability of resources. This can lead to adverse effects on the economic efficiency, continuity and quality of our\nservices.\nThe aforementioned risks are monitored via ongoing project management and investment controlling so that targeted\ncountermeasures can be taken at an early stage. The status of investment projects is documented on a regular basis and reported\nto the Group Board of Management and, for larger projects, to the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Group Board of Management\nis informed promptly of any critical projects.\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of investment projects.\nOperational opportunities and risks\nLogistics services are generally provided in bulk and require a complex operational and external infrastructure with high quality\nstandards. Any weaknesses with regard to the tendering, sorting, transport, warehousing, customs clearance or delivery of\nshipments could seriously compromise our competitive position. In particular, the impairment of significant infrastructure such as\ncentral transport hubs can have negative effects. To consistently guarantee reliability and punctual delivery, processes must be\norganized so as to proceed smoothly with no technical or personnel-related glitches. We counteract potential operational risks, for\nexample through efficient workflows and structures. We also take out insurance policies to guard against potential losses.\nMost recently, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the global pandemic in recent years, have revealed\nhow external factors can restrict our transport routes and means or reduce the availability of our employees, and hence potentially\nimpair our operating performance. For information on the measures we are taking to protect our employees, please refer to the\ncategories titled \u201cHuman resources\u201d and \u201cEnvironment, catastrophes and epidemics.\u201d\nA large number of internal processes must be aligned so that we can render our services. These include \u2013 in addition to our\nfundamental operating processes \u2013 supporting functions such as sales and purchasing. The extent to which we succeed in aligning\nour internal processes to meet customer needs while simultaneously lowering costs correlates with potential positive deviations\nfrom the current projections. Our earnings projections already incorporate the expected cost savings.\nIncreased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change can be expected in the coming years, including limits on air\ntransport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our business models. The resulting risk represents a risk of\nmedium significance for us currently (2).\nAt this time, we do not see any additional specific operational opportunities or risks of material significance.\n102 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nOpportunities and risks arising from human resources\nQualified, dedicated and motivated employees are a prerequisite for sustainable success. Demographic change and a tense labor\nmarket situation across all job types in some regions represent a challenge for recruiting workers on a local level. To address this\nadequately and to avoid labor shortages, we place particular emphasis on our recruiting activities. In addition, we prevent staff\nshortages through recruiting measures abroad, by using skilled labor migration and by hiring refugees.\nFor our business success and a low level of staff turnover, it is important to provide our employees with development opportunities\nand foster their long-term loyalty to the company. In this context, we value the professional development of our executives, with\nour Group-wide Leadership Attributes serving as a guide for action. Furthermore, we ensure that our employees are able to\ncontinuously improve their skills in line with their needs through on-the-job learning opportunities as well as off-the-job training\ncourses.\nThe health and safety of our employees are of central importance for DHL Group. We therefore place a high value on health and\noccupational safety measures. With respect to occupational health, we make use of initiatives tailored to local requirements and\ncooperate across divisions in the management of healthcare initiatives. This is supplemented with health and exercise programs\nand targeted checkup offers on-site. In addition, we address risks in the area of mental health using prevention, including by means\nof a continuously refined system for assessing risks associated with mental stresses and as part of our Certified programs for staff\ndevelopment.\nAs a globally active company with approximately 590,000 employees (headcount as of December 31, 2023) in over 220 countries\nand territories, upholding human rights is a top priority for us. We account for this responsibility through our Human Rights Policy\nStatement. If infringements are reported, we will take appropriate measures for clarification.\nThe development of staff costs is a key factor for us due to the large number of employees. This factor is also being driven by the\ncurrently high levels of inflation. The current collective bargaining agreement of Deutsche Post AG is valid for 2023 and 2024. The\ndevelopment of staff costs is no longer a risk of material significance for us at this time.\nOverall, we do not currently see any personnel-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\nOpportunities and risks arising from information technology\nThe security of our information systems is particularly important to us. The goal is to ensure continuous IT system operation and\nprevent unauthorized access to our systems and databases. To this end, we have defined guidelines, standards and procedures\nbased upon ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management. In addition, IT risks are monitored and\nassessed on an ongoing basis by Group Risk Management, Corporate Internal Audit, Data Protection and Corporate Security.\nFor our business processes to run smoothly at all times, the essential IT systems must be continuously available. We have therefore\ndesigned our systems to protect against complete system failure. Our software is monitored and updated regularly to address\npotential bugs, close gaps in security and increase functionality. We employ a patch management process \u2013 a defined procedure for\nmanaging software upgrades \u2013 to control risks that could arise from outdated software or from software upgrades. In this context,\nwe use structured processes to collect and check the devices and software versions used in our IT network, the goal being to\nachieve the highest possible level of coverage.\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can generally only access the data they need to perform their duties.\nSystems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. We make use of outsourced\ndata centers of established providers and operate central data centers in the Czech Republic, Malaysia and the United States. Our\nsystems are thus geographically separate and, in addition, are replicated at local disaster recovery locations.\n103 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nGOVERNANCE\nAnnual Corporate Governance Statement\npursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB with respect to Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG and DHL Group.\nDeclaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\nDeutsche Post(cid:3)AG complied with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year\nunder review. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board intend to comply with all suggestions and recommendations in\nthe future as well. In December(cid:3)2023, they issued the following Declaration of Conformity:\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG declare that, since the issue of the Declaration of\nConformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code, as\namended on April 28, 2022, and published in the (cid:291)(cid:336)(cid:329)(cid:319)(cid:320)(cid:334)(cid:316)(cid:329)(cid:341)(cid:320)(cid:324)(cid:322)(cid:320)(cid:333) (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, have been complied with,\nand that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward.\nYou can view the current Declaration of Conformity and the Annual Corporate Governance Statement along with the Declarations\nof Conformity for the past five years on the company\u2019s website.\nCorporate governance principles and shared values\nOur business relationships and activities are based upon responsible business practices that comply with applicable laws,\ninternational guidelines and ethical standards, and this also forms part of the Group\u2019s strategy. Equally, we require our suppliers to\nact in this way. We encourage relationships with our employees, customers and other stakeholders, as well as the shareholders,\nwhose decisions to select DHL Group as an employer, supplier or investment are increasingly also based upon the requirement that\nwe apply good corporate governance criteria.\nWith the Code of Conduct, we have laid out the requirements of the conduct of our employees. It is applicable across all divisions and\nregions. In the Code of Conduct, we commit ourselves in particular to the principles set out in the United Nations (UN) Global\nCompact, comply with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and follow additional recognized legal\nstandards, including the applicable anti-corruption legislation and agreements. In addition, we take the International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational\nEnterprises into account. In addition, we support various sustainability initiatives, for example to promote the development of\nsustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of\ngreenhouse gases. As a long-standing partner of the United Nations, we support the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIn 2023, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\nThe Code of Conduct also describes our understanding of diversity and inclusion. This understanding and mutual respect promote\ncooperation within the Group and thus contribute to economic success. The criteria for the recruitment and professional\ndevelopment of our employees are exclusively their skills and qualifications. The members of the Board of Management and the\nSupervisory Board support the diversity measures, with a particular focus on the Group\u2019s goal of increasing the number of women\nin management. Doing business includes using our expertise as a service provider in the mail services and logistics sector for the\nbenefit of society and the environment, and we motivate our employees to engage personally in this regard.\nEnsuring that our interactions with business partners, shareholders and the public are conducted with integrity and within the\nbounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation. This is also the foundation of DHL Group\u2019s lasting business success. Our\ncompliance management system (CMS) is designed to promote legally compliant conduct as well as to prevent corruption and\nanticompetitive conduct in particular. Insights gained from compliance audits and reported violations are also used to continually\nimprove and upgrade the CMS system. To this end, the enhanced compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard) offers Group-wide,\n112 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\ncentralized and systematic collection of all key figures related to compliance notifications and the clarification of issues. In addition,\nfurther measures were taken to promote the culture of compliance and compliance reporting was established.\nCooperation between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, remuneration, retirement ages\nAs a listed German public limited company, Deutsche Post(cid:3)AG has a two-tier board structure comprising the Board of Management\nand the Supervisory Board.\nMembers of the Board of Management are responsible for the management of the company. They manage their Board\ndepartments independently, except where decisions of particular significance and consequence for the company or the Group\nrequire a resolution by all members of the Board of Management. Each member of the Board of Management is obligated to\nsubordinate the interests of their individual Board departments to the collective interests of the company and to inform the Board\nof Management about significant developments in their departments. The Board of Management ensures compliance with\nstatutory provisions and internal guidelines within the company (compliance). The internal control system and the risk\nmanagement system comprise a CMS aligned with the risk situation of the company and also include targets related to\nsustainability.\nThe CEO conducts Board of Management business, aligns Board department activities with the company\u2019s collective goals and\nplans, and ensures that corporate policy is carried out. When making decisions, members of the Board of Management may not act\nin their own personal interest or exploit corporate business opportunities for their own benefit. Any conflicts of interest must be\ndisclosed to the chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management without delay; the other Board of Management\nmembers must also be informed. The Supervisory Board has determined that appointments to the Board of Management should\ngenerally end by the time the member turns 65.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board appoint, advise and oversee the Board of Management. They propose the remuneration\nsystem for Board of Management members to the Annual General Meeting, and \u2013 together with the Board of Management \u2013 are\njointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. Furthermore, the statutory obligations of\nthe Supervisory Board include the review and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the review of the\nproposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit and the recommendation of the auditor to the Annual General Meeting.\nFor proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board will ensure that their term of office ends no\nlater than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member turns 72. As a general rule,\nSupervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\nThe company\u2019s D & O (directors and officers) insurance for the members of the Board of Management provides for a deductible as\nset out in the AktG.\nThe principles governing the Supervisory Board\u2019s internal organization, a catalog of Board of Management transactions requiring\napproval and the work of the Supervisory Board committees are governed by the rules of procedure, which are available on the\ncompany\u2019s website. The Chair, elected by the members of the Supervisory Board from their ranks, coordinates the work of the\nSupervisory Board and represents the Supervisory Board publicly. The Chair holds talks with investors on topics relevant to the\nSupervisory Board. The Supervisory Board represents the company in respect of the Board of Management members. Members of\nthe Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual remuneration of \u20ac100,000. The remuneration for each of the chairs (plenary and\ncommittees) increases by 100%, for the Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and for committee members by 50%. This does not\napply to the Mediation or Nomination Committees. The report on remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board\nmembers can be accessed along with the auditor\u2019s report pursuant to Section 162(3) AktG on the company\u2019s website. There are no\ncontracts between the company and Supervisory Board members, with the exception of the employment contracts with the\nemployee representatives.\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least twice each half year, regularly also without the Board of Management present. Extraordinary\nmeetings are held as required. In the 2023 fiscal year, Supervisory Board members held four plenary meetings, 21 committee\nmeetings and one closed meeting. The meetings took place in person, with a few exceptions for the committee meetings. Individual\n113 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report The Company Consolidated Financial Statements\nCombined Management Report Further Information\nmembers joined via videoconference. In cases where individual members were unable to participate, they submitted their votes in\nwriting in advance of the meeting and thus ensured that the decisions made were based on the decisions of all responsible\nmembers. The overall attendance rate of 95% is broken down by member in the report of the Supervisory Board.\nSupervisory Board decisions are prepared in advance in separate meetings of the shareholder representatives and the employee\nrepresentatives, and by the relevant committees. During the plenary meetings, the committee chairs inform the other members\nabout the work and decisions of the committees. Supervisory Board members are personally responsible for ensuring they receive\ntraining and professional development measures. They receive appropriate support from the company in the process. In 2023, the\nDirectors\u2019 Days took place in May and September. The topics covered included the regulation of the postal market, ESG key\nperformance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply\nchain legislation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting and the EU Taxonomy.\nSuccession planning for the Board of Management\nTogether with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the\nBoard of Management. To this end, in particular the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly discuss\ncandidates with the potential to take on positions on the Board of Management. Within the Supervisory Board, the search for\nsuitable Board of Management members is primarily the responsibility of the Executive Committee. In the event of an upcoming\nvacancy, the Executive Committee selects suitable candidates for personal interviews, taking into account specific requirements for\nexperience and qualifications to be met by the members and the composition of the Board of Management as a whole and, after\ndiscussing this list of candidates, submits it to the Supervisory Board.\nIndependent of specific upcoming vacancies, potential successors from within the Group are given the opportunity to give a\npresentation on topics from their own areas of responsibility before the Supervisory Board. In this way, the Supervisory Board\nmaintains an overview of the potential of Group executives who could be considered for a position on the Board of Management.\nWhen appointing new members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board ensures that the different skills and\nexperiences of the members supplement the Board of Management and that its membership is thus diverse. International\nexperience is of particular importance, in addition to industry experience. The initial term of service for members of the Board of\nManagement generally runs for three years.\nIndependence of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\nAll Supervisory Board members are independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code. This exceeds the\ntarget for the Supervisory Board of filling at least 60% of mandates on the shareholder side with independent members.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest shareholder in the company, KfW Bankengruppe, holds 20.49% of the shares in Deutsche\nPost(cid:3)AG and therefore does not exercise control, nor does the German federal government, which is an indirect shareholder via the\nKfW. Accordingly, Luise H\u00f6lscher and Stefan B. Wintels are also independent. On February 7, 2024, KfW Bankengruppe reduced its\nshareholding in Deutsche Post AG to 16.45%.\nStefan Schulte, who is resigning from the Supervisory Board after the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 3, 2024, has\ncontributed his comprehensive expertise and experience to the benefit of the company throughout his term of office and, as the\nChair of the Financial and Audit Committee, engaged the Board of Management in differentiated and critical discussions. His\nindependence was therefore not in question at any time for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will recommend two\nnew independent Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting to succeed Stefan Schulte and Simone Menne, who\nis also stepping down from the Finance and Audit Committee. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the\nreport of the Supervisory Board.\nLawrence Rosen\u2019s responsibility for the Board department Finance ended more than seven years ago and therefore does not impair\nhis independence. At the same time, his profound knowledge of the company and the industry make it possible for him to support\nthe Board of Management as an experienced and expert adviser and to perform the monitoring duties of the Supervisory Board in\nparticular.\n114 DHL Group \u2013 2023 Annual Report"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.

Siemens Healthineers Group ( hereinafter \u201c Siemens Healthineers , \u201d the \u201c company , \u201d \u201c we , \u201d or the \u201c Group \u201d ) comprises the parent company Siemens Healthineers AG , a stock corporation under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany , and its subsidiaries . Siemens Healthineers AG is incorporated in the commercial register in Munich , Germany . The company \u2019 s business operations are conducted by the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Siemens Healthineers AG . As of September 30 , 2022 , the Siemens Group held just over 75 % of the shares in Siemens Healthineers AG , unchanged from the prior year . Siemens Healthineers had about 69,500 employees as of September 30 , 2022 ( September 30 , 2021 : about 66,000 ) . Siemens Healthineers has a strong presence and market position in growth markets and is directly represented in more than 70 countries worldwide . Our main production sites are in the United States , China , and Germany . With holistic system competence , we develop , manufacture , and sell a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers in more than 180 countries . We also provide clinical consulting services as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings . This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the entire care continuum , from prevention and early detection through to diagnosis , treatment , and follow-up care . Delivering high-quality , affordable healthcare requires scalable solutions that meet the needs of a broad spectrum of healthcare providers and related organizations . Siemens Healthineers is strongly positioned relative to this spectrum , which ranges from public and private healthcare providers , including hospitals and hospital systems , public and private clinics and laboratories , universities , physicians/joint medical practices , public health agencies , public and private health insurers , through to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes . We offer different solutions tailored to the customers \u2019 needs in all these markets .

Our Imaging segment provides imaging products , services , and solutions as well as digital offerings . Our most important products in this segment are devices for magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , X-ray , molecular imaging , and ultrasound . All our imaging and therapy systems are supported by shared software platforms . We offer a broad and scalable range of software solutions to support the reading and structured reporting of diagnostic images from different modalities . We generate a significant amount of recurring revenues from our customer services business ( services and spare parts ) due to a strong installed base and long-term service relationships . These provide a stable business base . The Cancer Therapy business ( imaging for radiation therapy ) will be part of the Varian segment as of October 1 , 2022 . The portfolio of our Diagnostics segment comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that we offer to healthcare providers in the fields of laboratory diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics . With a broad selection of diagnostic test settings \u2013 from centralized reference and hospital laboratories to clinical and physician office laboratories \u2013 our comprehensive portfolio covers a range of testing disciplines , including immunochemistry , hematology , coagulation , urinalysis , blood gas analysis , and molecular tests . Siemens Healthineers provides laboratories and points of care with a range of antigen , PCR , and antibody tests designed to specifically identify the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen . Diagnostics \u2019 product range also includes efficient workflow solutions for laboratories and informatics products that are integrated with our offerings to improve provider productivity . Diagnostics generates profits mainly from long-term contracts that include an initial instrument placement followed by ongoing reagent sales , which results in a predictable and resilient revenue stream . The Varian segment provides innovative , multi-modality cancer care technologies along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics globally . Its portfolio is designed to enable clinicians to perform new , innovative radiotherapy and other oncology treatments . Varian \u2019 s Radiation Oncology business serves the end-to-end needs of customers with integrated equipment and digital solutions , and applications that are designed to enable increased access to quality care as well as improved treatment planning and delivery . High-quality imaging and digital solutions and applications enable higher-precision image-guided cancer treatments . The Proton Solutions business utilizes conventional radiotherapy expertise to develop integrated solutions for proton therapy . Effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2023 , this business was assigned to Central Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Business principles 06 Items , under the management responsibility of Varian , given that , in the future , the business will not be actively marketing or pursuing new sales of proton systems but concentrate on maintenance of equipment already ordered or already installed , thereby enhancing system reliability and stability , and providing a high level of service for existing customers and their proton centers . The Multi-Disciplinary Oncology business comprises technology-enabled optimized workflows , clinical services , and consulting capabilities as well as innovative digital solutions and applications for managing treatment and therapy . With a large installed base in its Radiation Oncology business , Varian generates recurring revenue from services and spare parts . On October 1 , 2022 , the Cancer Therapy business will be transferred from the Imaging segment to the Varian segment and will be part of the Varian segment effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2023 . Our Advanced Therapies segment \u2019 s portfolio consists of highly integrated products , services and solutions across multiple clinical fields used in the treatment of diseases . Our Advanced Therapies products are designed to support image-guided minimally invasive treatments , in areas such as cardiology , interventional radiology , and surgery . The most important products in this segment are angiography systems and mobile C-arms as well as a robotic-assisted platform for endovascular coronary and peripheral vascular interventions . Advanced Therapies generates recurring revenues through its strong installed base and customer services business ( service and spare parts ) . Within these four segments we provide comprehensive services all along the customer value chain , among them planning and design , maintenance , operational management , financing , training and education services \u2013 for example , within partnerships with hospital operators , so called value partnerships . Our service offerings include equipment performance management , clinical education and e-learning , asset management , managed departmental services for laboratories and healthcare facilities , consulting and digital health products and services . With our value partnerships , we actively address the trend of consolidation among healthcare providers \uf0e8 A.1.2 Business environment and cover customer needs through a broad and deep portfolio . As the partnerships with customers last for several years , we generate recurring revenues on a regular basis . Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 Against the backdrop of the healthcare trends described in \uf0e8 A.1.2 Business environment . Siemens Healthineers has defined strategic priorities to ensure its competitiveness beyond 2025 . Within our Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 , we have successfully completed the first two phases known as Reinforcing and Upgrading . The transformational business combination of Siemens Healthineers and Varian , for instance , enabled us to expand into adjacent markets . At the same time , we have expanded our core business and strengthened our role as a holistic partner for our customers . At the start of fiscal year 2022 , we embarked on the third phase of our strategy . During this New Ambition phase , Siemens Healthineers \u2019 aspiration is to achieve annual comparable revenue growth of 6\u20138 % and annual growth in adjusted basic earnings per share of 12\u201315 % for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 excluding COVID-19 rapid antigen test contribution . The outlook for fiscal year 2023 is shown in the chapter \uf0e8 A.5.2 Expected business development . The goal of the New Ambition phase is to fight the most dangerous diseases worldwide , enable efficient workflows , and enter new growth markets while remaining successful in our core markets . The New Ambition phase focuses on five growth priorities or vectors ( see below ) , and our segments and regions are now executing on the plans and programs they developed for pursuing these priorities . In the Comprehensive Cancer Care vector , we want to expand our leading position in oncology by addressing further customer segments along the entire disease pathway . To this end , we intend to enhance and strongly integrate our radiotherapy and imaging products , build a strong portfolio in interventional oncology , expand our multidisciplinary software solutions and technology-enabled services , and expand our cancer decision support for better therapy guidance . In the Cardiovascular and Neurovascular Care vector , we want to leverage our strengths in imaging and endovascular robotic systems to further enhance our relevance in the field of cardiovascular and neurovascular treatments . The Networked Care & Digitally Enabled Services vector addresses the biggest challenges our customers are currently facing , such as staff shortages , rising labor costs , increasing demand , and rapid technological and scientific progress . Our ambition is to put healthcare providers in a position to provide more patients with better care by improving and automating manual workflows that have previously drained significant resources and given rise to inefficiencies . In the area of \u201c networked care , \u201d we want to become the partner of choice for decentralized healthcare . The China Healthcare growth vector concentrates on what is expected to be the biggest global market in medical technology by the year 2030 . As part of its 14th Five-Year Plan , China intends to adapt not only aspects of its economy and society to new developments , but also its own healthcare and medical technology sector . Our ambition is to strengthen our role as a trusted partner of the Chinese healthcare system and its patients . In the Access to Care vector , we will be focusing on the approximately three billion people worldwide who still do not have access to adequate healthcare today . The main obstacles here are a lack of infrastructure , financial affordability of treatment , and a lack of health awareness . As non-communicable diseases become more prevalent in the coming years , affordable health care will need to cover a broader base than before . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 28 A.6 Report on material risks and opportunities A.6.1 Risk management Basic principles of risk management For us , diligent handling of risks and opportunities is part of responsible corporate governance and supports our pursuit of sustainable growth and thereby increased company value . Hence it is essential to manage risks and opportunities appropriately . Our risk management is therefore an integral part of the planning and implementation of our business strategies . The risk management policy is set by the Managing Board . In accordance with our organizational and accountability structure , the respective management of a business , region or function is obliged to implement a comprehensive risk management system . This is tailored to their specific area and its responsibilities , while at the same time being consistent with the overall policy . Company-wide risk management process and organization ( Enterprise Risk Management Process ) We make use of a coordinated set of risk management and control systems . These support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business . The most important of these systems include our company-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting . Strategic planning is intended to support us in assessing potential risks well in advance of major business decisions . Management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses . Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management . Accordingly , if deficits are detected , it is possible to adopt appropriate measures to eliminate them . This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner . Risk management at Siemens Healthineers builds on a comprehensive , interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM ) approach . This approach is integrated into the organization and addresses both risks and opportunities . It is based on the globally accepted COSO ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) framework \u201c Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance \u201d ( 2017 ) as well as the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) Standard 31000 ( 2018 ) , and is adapted to Siemens Healthineers \u2019 requirements . The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process , our internal control system and compliance management system . They consider the company \u2019 s strategy , the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations , the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important . Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of , and response to , risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic , operational , financial and compliance objectives . The time horizon within the ERM approach is typically three years , and we take a net approach , addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective control measures . If risks or opportunities have already been considered in plans , budgets , forecasts or the financial statements ( for example as a provision or risk contingency ) , they have been incorporated , with their financial impact , in the entity \u2019 s business objectives . As a consequence , only additional risks or opportunities arising from the same subject ( for example deviations from business objectives , different impact perspectives ) should be considered for the ERM . In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities , risks and opportunities including social and environmental factors are identified in a structured procedure . This combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches . While reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle , this regular reporting process is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner . Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood , considering different perspectives , including business objectives , reputation and regulatory matters . The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of the Siemens Healthineers businesses and regions . This top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at the management level and are included in the subsequent reporting process , if found to be relevant . Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational levels mentioned above . Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities . The hierarchical assignment of responsibility depends on the significance of the risk or opportunity . In a first step , assuming responsibility involves choosing one of our general response strategies . The general response strategies with respect to risks are to avoid , transfer , reduce , retain or watch the relevant risk . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 34 A.6.2.4 Compliance risks Regulatory Environment As a globally operating and diversified medical technology company , we are exposed to various increasingly complex product and country-specific regulations , laws and policies that influence our business activities and processes . A failure to comply with existing regulations or changed and new regulatory requirements could result in governmental fines and other sanctions , the temporary or permanent shutdown of production facilities , third-party claims , import restrictions and negative publicity . This could affect our ability to deliver , our time to market for certain products or product life cycles and thus lead to unforeseen costs and have a negative impact on our financial position . Further , our business may be affected by new laws and regulations , in particular by those that may govern innovative products and business activities , including services and solutions , such as the use of artificial intelligence . For these new subject areas the regulatory requirements are often not yet defined , or they may undergo future changes whose effects can not yet be estimated . Regulatory authorities including the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) in the United States , the National Medical Product Administration ( NMPA ) in China and regulations including the Medical Device Regulation ( MDR ) and In-Vitro Diagnostics Regulation ( IVDR ) in Europe are especially relevant for the commercialization of our products and services . However , there are numerous other regulatory schemes in practically all jurisdictions worldwide to which we are subject . Risks could also arise from effects of regulations in the area of Environment , Health , and Safety ( EHS ) including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances ( RoHS ) and Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ( REACH ) and other sustainability regulations . We need to comply with and safeguard requirements that will ensure product safety and regulatory market access . To counter the risks mentioned above , we monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas with the objective of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions . Furthermore , we issue internal regulations and guidance , conduct continuous training and communication as well as synchronized implementation actions . In addition , internal and external audits of compliance with laws and regulations are performed . Compliance with Laws In connection with our global business activities , we must ensure compliance with antitrust and competition law , anti-corruption legislation , data protection regulations and other laws . We have established compliance and risk management systems to ensure compliance with requirements . Nevertheless , there is no guarantee that these systems will enable us to avoid all risks in every jurisdiction . There are risks , for example , regarding data privacy violations in the processing of personal data of our employees , customers , customers ' patients , or other business partners . Moreover , in our business environment , there are risks regarding antitrust or corruption law violations and other violations of law . Consequences of violations of the law could under certain circumstances affect us also if they relate to violations by our indirect sales channels or business partners . In addition , a significant portion of our business involves governments and companies with public shareholders . We are also involved in various projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations . This may pose risks from a compliance perspective . Furthermore , we may face compliance risks in connection with recently acquired companies that are still in the integration process . There could also be risks related to violations of other laws and legislation such as export control and embargo regulations and intellectual property rights . All of these risks could result in violations of law with severe consequences and can have a negative impact on our business , net assets , financial position , and results of operations . They could also result in claims for damages , fines or penalties , the exclusion of direct or indirect participation in certain types of transactions and public tenders , and reputational damage . Consequently , we are constantly countering these risks with targeted measures . The foundation for our governance framework is provided by our globally applicable directives . In addition to measures such as general compliance training , our Antitrust Compliance Program , requirements of our Business Conduct Guidelines and Data Protection Program , we have established a global compliance organization . This organization conducts , among other things , audits to identify compliance risks at an early stage . Moreover , by providing whistleblower hotlines and establishing internal and external points of contact , we enable the timely reporting of potential deficiencies or violations to us , authorities or other stakeholders as appropriate . With regard to our business partners , we have established a global business partner management system . This includes , among other measures , a careful selection process , a structured onboarding process as well as training , monitoring and a close exchange during our visits to the customer 's site as well as regular audits with consistent implementation and monitoring of measures taken . To meet the legal and internal requirements for data protection , we have implemented an information security and data protection management system whose mechanisms meet the high requirements of the ISO 27001 extended by 27701 standards , under which we are certified . Assessment of the overall risk situation The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories above \u2013 strategic , operational , financial and compliance risks \u2013 reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure . The most significant risks we are currently exposed to are \uf0e8 Economic , Political and Geopolitical Developments , \uf0e8 Cybersecurity and \uf0e8 Supply Chain Management . Compared to the prior year and as already described in the half-year financial report \uf0e8 Economic , Political and Geopolitical Developments constitutes the most significant risk . In addition , the exposure of \uf0e8 Supply Chain Management increased continuously following developments over the last quarters , making it one of the most significant risks . We consider all other risks mentioned above not as high as the three most significant risks . At present , no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 36 A.6.4 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System Our Internal Control System ( ICS ) and Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM ) are based on the principles , guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board , which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board 's decisions . Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals , the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting , and compliance with the laws and regulations relevant to Siemens Healthineers . Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the regulatory requirements . Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) . Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard \u201c Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance \u201d ( 2017 ) and the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) Standard 31000 ( 2018 ) and is adapted to Siemens Healthineers requirements . Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized \u201c Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \u201d ( 2013 ) also developed by COSO . The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS . The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS , both systems are complementary . All Siemens Healthineers entities are part of our ICS and ERM . The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different , depending , among others , on the entity \u2019 s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the specific risks associated with the entity . The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility , based on the group-wide mandatory methodology . Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board . The Siemens Healthineers Risk and Internal Control ( RIC ) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and effective processes for implementing , monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities . It consists of the central RIC departments and those responsible in the businesses , regions and functions . The central RIC departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group . We also have an overarching , integrated ICS and ERM methodology ( RIC methodology ) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined , documented in accordance with uniform standards , and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness . For more information on ERM , see chapter \uf0e8 A.6.1 Risk management . Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject to audit activities by our internal audit function . These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request . At the end of each fiscal year , our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM . This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens Healthineers \u201c In Control \u201d Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings . The purpose of the `` In Control '' Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens Healthineers AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year , to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and report any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities . The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM . The Siemens Healthineers \u201c In Control \u201d Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies . In the quarterly Managing Board meetings , the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated , the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS and ERM . Based on this , the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30 , 2022 . Nevertheless , there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system . For example , and no system , \u2013 even if deemed to be adequate and effective \u2013 can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances . The Audit Committee is also integrated into our control system . In particular , it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the effectiveness of the ICM and ERM and the internal audit system . Furthermore , we have set up a disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and nonfinancial information prior to publication . The integration of Varian into our ICS , which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition , continued in fiscal year 2022 and was completed to a large extent with regard to the most significant Varian entities . The integration measures will be continued in fiscal year 2023 . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 37 A.6.4.2 Compliance Management System The ICS and ERM are supplemented by a Compliance Management System ( CMS ) geared to the company 's risk situation . Our CMS is based on the three pillars : prevent , detect and respond and includes the legal risk areas of corruption , antitrust law , data protection , money laundering , export controls and respect for human rights . It is based on an extensive internal set of rules : The Siemens Healthineers Business Conduct Guidelines ( \u201c BCG \u201d ) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers , external partners and the public . In addition , there are extensive internal compliance regulations , including associated controls , which oblige all Siemens Healthineers employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS . They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information . The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works . Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks . The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools in order to initiate appropriate risk minimization measures . The results of compliance risk management that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the company-wide ERM . The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide . It is part of the ICS and is continuously being further developed and adapted to the current Siemens Healthineers guidelines . In addition , current compliance issues are discussed at management level on a regular basis . The entire CMS is continually adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements . The findings from compliance risk management and compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for further development of the CMS . A.6.4.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM The overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM as part of the overarching ICS and ERM is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner , such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of Siemens Healthineers as well as the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers AG as a parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations . Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) , for further information see \uf0e8 A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System . At the end of each fiscal year , our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS . Siemens Healthineers has a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined , documented in accordance with uniform standards , and tested regularly for their effectiveness . Nevertheless , there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system , and no control system , including one determined to be effective , may prevent or detect all misstatements . Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally provided conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform financial reporting guidelines and a chart of accounts . They are issued centrally by the Siemens Group and complemented by additional Siemens Healthineers guidelines for business-specific financial reporting topics . Siemens Healthineers AG and other entities within Siemens Healthineers are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code ; the conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code . The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis . Accounting departments are informed regularly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective . The base data used in preparing our financial statements consist of the closing data reported by Siemens Healthineers AG and its subsidiaries . Governance and monitoring activities relating to accounting activities are usually bundled on a regional level . In particular cases , such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits , we engage external service providers . The reported closing data are used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system . The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 38 Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and regular training . As a fundamental principle , based on materiality considerations , the \u201c four eyes \u201d principle applies and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization . Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items , both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements . In line with our information security requirements , accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access . An internal certification process is executed on a quarterly basis . Management at different levels of our organization , supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility , confirms the accuracy of the financial data that have been reported to Siemens Healthineers \u2019 headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems . The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS , which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition , continued in fiscal year 2022 and was largely completed with regard to the most significant Varian entities . The integration measures will be continued in fiscal year 2023 . Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity as well as our accounting-related ICS and ERM . The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related ICS . In particular , it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated ICS , the ERM and the internal audit system . Furthermore , we have set up a disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and non-financial information prior to publication . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Additional information \u2013 Report of the Supervisory Board 114 Topics at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board In fiscal year 2022 , the Supervisory Board held seven regular meetings and adopted two resolutions by written circulation .

At the meeting on February 2 , 2022 , the Managing Board reported on the net assets , financial position , and results of operations as of the end of the first fiscal quarter , still including effects of the COVID-19 pandemic . In addition , we discussed talent development within the company and the topic of sustainability . At the meeting on May 3 , 2022 , the Managing Board reported to us on the net assets , financial position , and results of operations as of the end of the second fiscal quarter , including current developments as regards the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the war in Ukraine . At our meeting on August 2 , 2022 , in addition to dealing with the Managing Board \u2019 s report on the net assets , financial position , and results of operations as of the end of the third fiscal quarter , including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic , we also reviewed the results of our questionnaire-based self-assessment , including the supplementary interview of the Managing Board conducted by an external consultancy . Furthermore , in preparation for the Declaration of Conformity to be issued in September , we examined the German Corporate Governance Code ( GCGC ) and the effects of its amendments on the company . In this context , we also covered the topic of sustainability and , based on the Chairperson \u2019 s Committee \u2019 s preliminary considerations , considered an amendment to the name of the Innovation and Finance Committee for fiscal 2023 , reflecting this additional focus on sustainability . We furthermore discussed the preparations for the Supervisory Board elections to be held at the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting 2023 . The meeting on September 30 , 2022 , centered on the 2023 budget and the strategic focus of the businesses . We discussed various aspects of corporate governance and resolved , in particular , to amend the Supervisory Board \u2019 s bylaws and to approve the latest Declaration of Conformity with the GCGC prepared in accordance with Section 161 Stock Corporation Act . The aim of the amendments , which entered into force the same day , was in particular to place a stronger focus on sustainability ; it now being prescribed , inter alia , that the Innovation and Finance Committee is to regularly deal with sustainability related topics ( Environmental , Social and Governance \u2013 ESG ) . In addition , the Supervisory Board discussed the results of the tender to audit the annual and consolidated financial statements and to review the half-year financial report for fiscal year 2024 . The Supervisory Board declared its intention to submit a nomination proposal to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting 2024 based on the Audit Committee \u2019 s recommendation . The members of the Supervisory Board take responsibility for undertaking any training or professional development measures necessary to fulfil their duties . They keep informed about the latest requirements with regard to their supervisory duties and are supported by the company appropriately . In this context , the company offered the Supervisory Board members three informational events in the past fiscal year \u2013 on two of the four business areas and on cybersecurity . The aim of these events , to be continued in the coming fiscal year , is to provide the members of the Supervisory Board with a better understanding of the business , including its strategy and structures . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Additional information \u2013 Report of the Supervisory Board 115 Work in the Supervisory Board committees In order to perform our duties efficiently , we have established a total of four committees , which prepare proposals for resolutions and issues to be dealt with at the Supervisory Board \u2019 s plenary meetings . Some of the Supervisory Board \u2019 s decision-making powers have also been delegated to these committees to the extent permitted by law . The committee chairs report on their committees \u2019 work to the Supervisory Board at the subsequent Supervisory Board meeting . Details of the members and the tasks of the individual Supervisory Board committees are provided in \uf0e8 C.4.1.2 Composition and working methods of the Supervisory Board of the Annual Report 2022 . The Chairperson \u2019 s Committee met eleven times in the reporting period ( four of these meetings were extraordinary ) . It also adopted one resolution by written circulation . Between meetings , the chair of the Supervisory Board discussed topics of major importance with the members of the Chairperson \u2019 s Committee . The Chairperson \u2019 s Committee concerned itself , in particular , with corporate governance topics , including the importance of sustainability to the Supervisory Board and the recommendations to the Supervisory Board on the corresponding amendments to the Bylaws . The latter also included the Innovation and Finance Committee regularly dealing with sustainability-related topics ( ESG ) and an amendment to its name as a consequence of its extended responsibilities . The Chairperson \u2019 s Committee further discussed the reallocation of responsibilities among the Managing Board members , and personnel topics , such as the appointment of a new Managing Board member .

Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Additional information \u2013 Report of the Supervisory Board 117 Audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements discussed in detail The independent auditors , Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ( Stuttgart , Germany ) , audited the annual financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG , the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Healthineers , and the combined management report for Siemens Healthineers AG and the Group for fiscal year 2022 , and issued an unqualified opinion . The annual financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG and the combined management report for Siemens Healthineers AG and the Group were prepared in accordance with the requirements of German law . The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) as adopted by the European Union and with the additional requirements of German law set out in Section 315 e ( 1 ) German Commercial Code . The consolidated financial statements also comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) . The auditors conducted their audit in accordance with Section 317 German Commercial Code , the EU Audit Regulation , and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer ( IDW ) , as well as in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing ( ISA ) . The aforementioned documents , as well as the Managing Board \u2019 s proposal for the appropriation of net income , were submitted to us in advance by the Managing Board . The Audit Committee discussed the dividend proposal in detail at its meeting on November 7 , 2022 . It discussed the annual financial statements , the consolidated financial statements , and the combined management report in detail at its meeting on November 25 , 2022 . In this context , the Audit Committee concerned itself , in particular , with key audit matters as described in the independent auditors \u2019 report , including the audit procedures implemented . The auditors \u2019 reports were presented to all members of the Supervisory Board and were reviewed comprehensively in the presence of the independent auditors at the Supervisory Board meeting on November 25 , 2022 . The independent auditors reported on the scope , focal points , and main findings of their audit , addressing , in particular , key audit matters and the audit procedures implemented . No major weaknesses in the risk management or internal control systems were reported . At the same meeting , the Managing Board explained the financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG and the Group as well as the risk management system . Another topic addressed at this meeting was the evaluation of the quality of the audit of the financial statements . The Audit Committee performed an evaluation based on previously determined audit quality indicators . On the basis of this evaluation , the Supervisory Board approved the proposal to be submitted to the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting regarding the election of the independent auditors , taking into account the Audit Committee \u2019 s recommendation . The Supervisory Board concurs with the results of the audit . Based on the definitive results of the Audit Committee \u2019 s preliminary examination and our own examination , we have no objections to raise . The Managing Board prepared the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements . We approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements . In view of our approval , the annual financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG are adopted as submitted .

Siemens Healthineers Group ( hereinafter \u201c Siemens Healthineers , \u201d the \u201c company , \u201d \u201c we , \u201d or the \u201c Group \u201d ) comprises the parent company Siemens Healthineers AG , a stock corporation under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany , and its subsidiaries . Siemens Healthineers AG is incorporated in the commercial register in Munich , Germany . The company \u2019 s business operations are conducted by the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Siemens Healthineers AG . As of September 30 , 2022 , the Siemens Group held just over 75 % of the shares in Siemens Healthineers AG , unchanged from the prior year . Siemens Healthineers had about 69,500 employees as of September 30 , 2022 ( September 30 , 2021 : about 66,000 ) . Siemens Healthineers has a strong presence and market position in growth markets and is directly represented in more than 70 countries worldwide . Our main production sites are in the United States , China , and Germany . With holistic system competence , we develop , manufacture , and sell a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers in more than 180 countries . We also provide clinical consulting services as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings . This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the entire care continuum , from prevention and early detection through to diagnosis , treatment , and follow-up care . Delivering high-quality , affordable healthcare requires scalable solutions that meet the needs of a broad spectrum of healthcare providers and related organizations .

The portfolio of our Diagnostics segment comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that we offer to healthcare providers in the fields of laboratory diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics . With a broad selection of diagnostic test settings \u2013 from centralized reference and hospital laboratories to clinical and physician office laboratories \u2013 our comprehensive portfolio covers a range of testing disciplines , including immunochemistry , hematology , coagulation , urinalysis , blood gas analysis , and molecular tests . Siemens Healthineers provides laboratories and points of care with a range of antigen , PCR , and antibody tests designed to specifically identify the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen . Diagnostics \u2019 product range also includes efficient workflow solutions for laboratories and informatics products that are integrated with our offerings to improve provider productivity . Diagnostics generates profits mainly from long-term contracts that include an initial instrument placement followed by ongoing reagent sales , which results in a predictable and resilient revenue stream . The Varian segment provides innovative , multi-modality cancer care technologies along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics globally . Its portfolio is designed to enable clinicians to perform new , innovative radiotherapy and other oncology treatments . Varian \u2019 s Radiation Oncology business serves the end-to-end needs of customers with integrated equipment and digital solutions , and applications that are designed to enable increased access to quality care as well as improved treatment planning and delivery . High-quality imaging and digital solutions and applications enable higher-precision image-guided cancer treatments . The Proton Solutions business utilizes conventional radiotherapy expertise to develop integrated solutions for proton therapy . Effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2023 , this business was assigned to Central Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Business principles 06 Items , under the management responsibility of Varian , given that , in the future , the business will not be actively marketing or pursuing new sales of proton systems but concentrate on maintenance of equipment already ordered or already installed , thereby enhancing system reliability and stability , and providing a high level of service for existing customers and their proton centers . The Multi-Disciplinary Oncology business comprises technology-enabled optimized workflows , clinical services , and consulting capabilities as well as innovative digital solutions and applications for managing treatment and therapy . With a large installed base in its Radiation Oncology business , Varian generates recurring revenue from services and spare parts . On October 1 , 2022 , the Cancer Therapy business will be transferred from the Imaging segment to the Varian segment and will be part of the Varian segment effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2023 . Our Advanced Therapies segment \u2019 s portfolio consists of highly integrated products , services and solutions across multiple clinical fields used in the treatment of diseases . Our Advanced Therapies products are designed to support image-guided minimally invasive treatments , in areas such as cardiology , interventional radiology , and surgery . The most important products in this segment are angiography systems and mobile C-arms as well as a robotic-assisted platform for endovascular coronary and peripheral vascular interventions . Advanced Therapies generates recurring revenues through its strong installed base and customer services business ( service and spare parts ) . Within these four segments we provide comprehensive services all along the customer value chain , among them planning and design , maintenance , operational management , financing , training and education services \u2013 for example , within partnerships with hospital operators , so called value partnerships . Our service offerings include equipment performance management , clinical education and e-learning , asset management , managed departmental services for laboratories and healthcare facilities , consulting and digital health products and services . With our value partnerships , we actively address the trend of consolidation among healthcare providers \uf0e8 A.1.2 Business environment and cover customer needs through a broad and deep portfolio . As the partnerships with customers last for several years , we generate recurring revenues on a regular basis . Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 Against the backdrop of the healthcare trends described in \uf0e8 A.1.2 Business environment . Siemens Healthineers has defined strategic priorities to ensure its competitiveness beyond 2025 . Within our Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 , we have successfully completed the first two phases known as Reinforcing and Upgrading . The transformational business combination of Siemens Healthineers and Varian , for instance , enabled us to expand into adjacent markets . At the same time , we have expanded our core business and strengthened our role as a holistic partner for our customers . At the start of fiscal year 2022 , we embarked on the third phase of our strategy . During this New Ambition phase , Siemens Healthineers \u2019 aspiration is to achieve annual comparable revenue growth of 6\u20138 % and annual growth in adjusted basic earnings per share of 12\u201315 % for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 excluding COVID-19 rapid antigen test contribution . The outlook for fiscal year 2023 is shown in the chapter \uf0e8 A.5.2 Expected business development . The goal of the New Ambition phase is to fight the most dangerous diseases worldwide , enable efficient workflows , and enter new growth markets while remaining successful in our core markets . The New Ambition phase focuses on five growth priorities or vectors ( see below ) , and our segments and regions are now executing on the plans and programs they developed for pursuing these priorities . In the Comprehensive Cancer Care vector , we want to expand our leading position in oncology by addressing further customer segments along the entire disease pathway . To this end , we intend to enhance and strongly integrate our radiotherapy and imaging products , build a strong portfolio in interventional oncology , expand our multidisciplinary software solutions and technology-enabled services , and expand our cancer decision support for better therapy guidance . In the Cardiovascular and Neurovascular Care vector , we want to leverage our strengths in imaging and endovascular robotic systems to further enhance our relevance in the field of cardiovascular and neurovascular treatments . The Networked Care & Digitally Enabled Services vector addresses the biggest challenges our customers are currently facing , such as staff shortages , rising labor costs , increasing demand , and rapid technological and scientific progress . Our ambition is to put healthcare providers in a position to provide more patients with better care by improving and automating manual workflows that have previously drained significant resources and given rise to inefficiencies . In the area of \u201c networked care , \u201d we want to become the partner of choice for decentralized healthcare . The China Healthcare growth vector concentrates on what is expected to be the biggest global market in medical technology by the year 2030 . As part of its 14th Five-Year Plan , China intends to adapt not only aspects of its economy and society to new developments , but also its own healthcare and medical technology sector . Our ambition is to strengthen our role as a trusted partner of the Chinese healthcare system and its patients . In the Access to Care vector , we will be focusing on the approximately three billion people worldwide who still do not have access to adequate healthcare today . The main obstacles here are a lack of infrastructure , financial affordability of treatment , and a lack of health awareness . As non-communicable diseases become more prevalent in the coming years , affordable health care will need to cover a broader base than before . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 28 A.6 Report on material risks and opportunities A.6.1 Risk management Basic principles of risk management For us , diligent handling of risks and opportunities is part of responsible corporate governance and supports our pursuit of sustainable growth and thereby increased company value . Hence it is essential to manage risks and opportunities appropriately . Our risk management is therefore an integral part of the planning and implementation of our business strategies . The risk management policy is set by the Managing Board . In accordance with our organizational and accountability structure , the respective management of a business , region or function is obliged to implement a comprehensive risk management system . This is tailored to their specific area and its responsibilities , while at the same time being consistent with the overall policy . Company-wide risk management process and organization ( Enterprise Risk Management Process ) We make use of a coordinated set of risk management and control systems . These support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business . The most important of these systems include our company-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting . Strategic planning is intended to support us in assessing potential risks well in advance of major business decisions . Management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses . Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management . Accordingly , if deficits are detected , it is possible to adopt appropriate measures to eliminate them . This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner . Risk management at Siemens Healthineers builds on a comprehensive , interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM ) approach . This approach is integrated into the organization and addresses both risks and opportunities . It is based on the globally accepted COSO ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) framework \u201c Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance \u201d ( 2017 ) as well as the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) Standard 31000 ( 2018 ) , and is adapted to Siemens Healthineers \u2019 requirements . The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process , our internal control system and compliance management system . They consider the company \u2019 s strategy , the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations , the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important . Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of , and response to , risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic , operational , financial and compliance objectives . The time horizon within the ERM approach is typically three years , and we take a net approach , addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective control measures . If risks or opportunities have already been considered in plans , budgets , forecasts or the financial statements ( for example as a provision or risk contingency ) , they have been incorporated , with their financial impact , in the entity \u2019 s business objectives . As a consequence , only additional risks or opportunities arising from the same subject ( for example deviations from business objectives , different impact perspectives ) should be considered for the ERM . In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities , risks and opportunities including social and environmental factors are identified in a structured procedure . This combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches . While reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle , this regular reporting process is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner . Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood , considering different perspectives , including business objectives , reputation and regulatory matters . The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of the Siemens Healthineers businesses and regions . This top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at the management level and are included in the subsequent reporting process , if found to be relevant . Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational levels mentioned above . Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities . The hierarchical assignment of responsibility depends on the significance of the risk or opportunity . In a first step , assuming responsibility involves choosing one of our general response strategies . The general response strategies with respect to risks are to avoid , transfer , reduce , retain or watch the relevant risk . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 34 A.6.2.4 Compliance risks Regulatory Environment As a globally operating and diversified medical technology company , we are exposed to various increasingly complex product and country-specific regulations , laws and policies that influence our business activities and processes . A failure to comply with existing regulations or changed and new regulatory requirements could result in governmental fines and other sanctions , the temporary or permanent shutdown of production facilities , third-party claims , import restrictions and negative publicity . This could affect our ability to deliver , our time to market for certain products or product life cycles and thus lead to unforeseen costs and have a negative impact on our financial position . Further , our business may be affected by new laws and regulations , in particular by those that may govern innovative products and business activities , including services and solutions , such as the use of artificial intelligence . For these new subject areas the regulatory requirements are often not yet defined , or they may undergo future changes whose effects can not yet be estimated . Regulatory authorities including the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) in the United States , the National Medical Product Administration ( NMPA ) in China and regulations including the Medical Device Regulation ( MDR ) and In-Vitro Diagnostics Regulation ( IVDR ) in Europe are especially relevant for the commercialization of our products and services . However , there are numerous other regulatory schemes in practically all jurisdictions worldwide to which we are subject . Risks could also arise from effects of regulations in the area of Environment , Health , and Safety ( EHS ) including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances ( RoHS ) and Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ( REACH ) and other sustainability regulations . We need to comply with and safeguard requirements that will ensure product safety and regulatory market access . To counter the risks mentioned above , we monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas with the objective of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions . Furthermore , we issue internal regulations and guidance , conduct continuous training and communication as well as synchronized implementation actions . In addition , internal and external audits of compliance with laws and regulations are performed . Compliance with Laws In connection with our global business activities , we must ensure compliance with antitrust and competition law , anti-corruption legislation , data protection regulations and other laws . We have established compliance and risk management systems to ensure compliance with requirements . Nevertheless , there is no guarantee that these systems will enable us to avoid all risks in every jurisdiction . There are risks , for example , regarding data privacy violations in the processing of personal data of our employees , customers , customers ' patients , or other business partners . Moreover , in our business environment , there are risks regarding antitrust or corruption law violations and other violations of law . Consequences of violations of the law could under certain circumstances affect us also if they relate to violations by our indirect sales channels or business partners . In addition , a significant portion of our business involves governments and companies with public shareholders . We are also involved in various projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations . This may pose risks from a compliance perspective . Furthermore , we may face compliance risks in connection with recently acquired companies that are still in the integration process . There could also be risks related to violations of other laws and legislation such as export control and embargo regulations and intellectual property rights . All of these risks could result in violations of law with severe consequences and can have a negative impact on our business , net assets , financial position , and results of operations . They could also result in claims for damages , fines or penalties , the exclusion of direct or indirect participation in certain types of transactions and public tenders , and reputational damage . Consequently , we are constantly countering these risks with targeted measures . The foundation for our governance framework is provided by our globally applicable directives . In addition to measures such as general compliance training , our Antitrust Compliance Program , requirements of our Business Conduct Guidelines and Data Protection Program , we have established a global compliance organization . This organization conducts , among other things , audits to identify compliance risks at an early stage . Moreover , by providing whistleblower hotlines and establishing internal and external points of contact , we enable the timely reporting of potential deficiencies or violations to us , authorities or other stakeholders as appropriate . With regard to our business partners , we have established a global business partner management system . This includes , among other measures , a careful selection process , a structured onboarding process as well as training , monitoring and a close exchange during our visits to the customer 's site as well as regular audits with consistent implementation and monitoring of measures taken . To meet the legal and internal requirements for data protection , we have implemented an information security and data protection management system whose mechanisms meet the high requirements of the ISO 27001 extended by 27701 standards , under which we are certified . Assessment of the overall risk situation The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories above \u2013 strategic , operational , financial and compliance risks \u2013 reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure . The most significant risks we are currently exposed to are \uf0e8 Economic , Political and Geopolitical Developments , \uf0e8 Cybersecurity and \uf0e8 Supply Chain Management . Compared to the prior year and as already described in the half-year financial report \uf0e8 Economic , Political and Geopolitical Developments constitutes the most significant risk . In addition , the exposure of \uf0e8 Supply Chain Management increased continuously following developments over the last quarters , making it one of the most significant risks . We consider all other risks mentioned above not as high as the three most significant risks . At present , no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 36 A.6.4 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System Our Internal Control System ( ICS ) and Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM ) are based on the principles , guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board , which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board 's decisions . Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals , the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting , and compliance with the laws and regulations relevant to Siemens Healthineers . Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the regulatory requirements . Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) . Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard \u201c Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance \u201d ( 2017 ) and the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) Standard 31000 ( 2018 ) and is adapted to Siemens Healthineers requirements . Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized \u201c Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \u201d ( 2013 ) also developed by COSO . The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS . The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS , both systems are complementary . All Siemens Healthineers entities are part of our ICS and ERM . The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different , depending , among others , on the entity \u2019 s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the specific risks associated with the entity . The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility , based on the group-wide mandatory methodology . Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board . The Siemens Healthineers Risk and Internal Control ( RIC ) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and effective processes for implementing , monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities . It consists of the central RIC departments and those responsible in the businesses , regions and functions . The central RIC departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group . We also have an overarching , integrated ICS and ERM methodology ( RIC methodology ) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined , documented in accordance with uniform standards , and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness . For more information on ERM , see chapter \uf0e8 A.6.1 Risk management . Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject to audit activities by our internal audit function . These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request . At the end of each fiscal year , our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM . This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens Healthineers \u201c In Control \u201d Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings . The purpose of the `` In Control '' Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens Healthineers AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year , to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and report any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities . The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM . The Siemens Healthineers \u201c In Control \u201d Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies . In the quarterly Managing Board meetings , the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated , the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS and ERM . Based on this , the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30 , 2022 . Nevertheless , there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system . For example , and no system , \u2013 even if deemed to be adequate and effective \u2013 can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances . The Audit Committee is also integrated into our control system . In particular , it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the effectiveness of the ICM and ERM and the internal audit system . Furthermore , we have set up a disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and nonfinancial information prior to publication . The integration of Varian into our ICS , which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition , continued in fiscal year 2022 and was completed to a large extent with regard to the most significant Varian entities . The integration measures will be continued in fiscal year 2023 . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 37 A.6.4.2 Compliance Management System The ICS and ERM are supplemented by a Compliance Management System ( CMS ) geared to the company 's risk situation . Our CMS is based on the three pillars : prevent , detect and respond and includes the legal risk areas of corruption , antitrust law , data protection , money laundering , export controls and respect for human rights . It is based on an extensive internal set of rules : The Siemens Healthineers Business Conduct Guidelines ( \u201c BCG \u201d ) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers , external partners and the public . In addition , there are extensive internal compliance regulations , including associated controls , which oblige all Siemens Healthineers employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS . They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information . The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works . Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks . The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools in order to initiate appropriate risk minimization measures . The results of compliance risk management that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the company-wide ERM . The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide . It is part of the ICS and is continuously being further developed and adapted to the current Siemens Healthineers guidelines . In addition , current compliance issues are discussed at management level on a regular basis . The entire CMS is continually adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements . The findings from compliance risk management and compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for further development of the CMS . A.6.4.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM The overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM as part of the overarching ICS and ERM is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner , such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of Siemens Healthineers as well as the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers AG as a parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations . Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) , for further information see \uf0e8 A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System . At the end of each fiscal year , our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS . Siemens Healthineers has a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined , documented in accordance with uniform standards , and tested regularly for their effectiveness . Nevertheless , there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system , and no control system , including one determined to be effective , may prevent or detect all misstatements . Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally provided conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform financial reporting guidelines and a chart of accounts . They are issued centrally by the Siemens Group and complemented by additional Siemens Healthineers guidelines for business-specific financial reporting topics . Siemens Healthineers AG and other entities within Siemens Healthineers are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code ; the conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code . The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis . Accounting departments are informed regularly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective . The base data used in preparing our financial statements consist of the closing data reported by Siemens Healthineers AG and its subsidiaries . Governance and monitoring activities relating to accounting activities are usually bundled on a regional level . In particular cases , such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits , we engage external service providers . The reported closing data are used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system . The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 38 Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and regular training . As a fundamental principle , based on materiality considerations , the \u201c four eyes \u201d principle applies and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization . Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items , both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements . In line with our information security requirements , accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access . An internal certification process is executed on a quarterly basis . Management at different levels of our organization , supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility , confirms the accuracy of the financial data that have been reported to Siemens Healthineers \u2019 headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems . The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS , which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition , continued in fiscal year 2022 and was largely completed with regard to the most significant Varian entities . The integration measures will be continued in fiscal year 2023 . Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity as well as our accounting-related ICS and ERM . The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related ICS . In particular , it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated ICS , the ERM and the internal audit system . Furthermore , we have set up a disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and non-financial information prior to publication .

In this context , we also covered the topic of sustainability and , based on the Chairperson \u2019 s Committee \u2019 s preliminary considerations , considered an amendment to the name of the Innovation and Finance Committee for fiscal 2023 , reflecting this additional focus on sustainability . We furthermore discussed the preparations for the Supervisory Board elections to be held at the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting 2023 . The meeting on September 30 , 2022 , centered on the 2023 budget and the strategic focus of the businesses . We discussed various aspects of corporate governance and resolved , in particular , to amend the Supervisory Board \u2019 s bylaws and to approve the latest Declaration of Conformity with the GCGC prepared in accordance with Section 161 Stock Corporation Act .

The auditors were commissioned to perform these tasks in the run-up to the meeting on September 30 , 2022 . Details of the compensation report can be found at \uf0e8 www.siemens-healthineers.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Additional information \u2013 Corporate governance statement 119 C.4 Corporate governance statement Publicly listed stock corporations are required to prepare and publish an annual statement on corporate governance , with the parent companies having to do so on behalf of their group companies . This statement combines the corporate governance statement of Siemens Healthineers AG in accordance with Section 289f German Commercial Code ( \u201c Handelsgesetzbuch \u201d ) and the Group corporate governance statement in accordance with Section 315d German Commercial Code . The corporate governance statement is an integral part of the combined management report .

Siemens Healthineers Group ( hereinafter \u201c Siemens Healthineers , \u201d the \u201c company , \u201d \u201c we , \u201d or the \u201c Group \u201d ) comprises the parent company Siemens Healthineers AG , a stock corporation under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany , and its subsidiaries . Siemens Healthineers AG is incorporated in the commercial register in Munich , Germany . The company \u2019 s business operations are conducted by the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Siemens Healthineers AG . As of September 30 , 2022 , the Siemens Group held just over 75 % of the shares in Siemens Healthineers AG , unchanged from the prior year . Siemens Healthineers had about 69,500 employees as of September 30 , 2022 ( September 30 , 2021 : about 66,000 ) . Siemens Healthineers has a strong presence and market position in growth markets and is directly represented in more than 70 countries worldwide . Our main production sites are in the United States , China , and Germany . With holistic system competence , we develop , manufacture , and sell a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers in more than 180 countries . We also provide clinical consulting services as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings . This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the entire care continuum , from prevention and early detection through to diagnosis , treatment , and follow-up care . Delivering high-quality , affordable healthcare requires scalable solutions that meet the needs of a broad spectrum of healthcare providers and related organizations . Siemens Healthineers is strongly positioned relative to this spectrum , which ranges from public and private healthcare providers , including hospitals and hospital systems , public and private clinics and laboratories , universities , physicians/joint medical practices , public health agencies , public and private health insurers , through to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes .

We generate a significant amount of recurring revenues from our customer services business ( services and spare parts ) due to a strong installed base and long-term service relationships . These provide a stable business base . The Cancer Therapy business ( imaging for radiation therapy ) will be part of the Varian segment as of October 1 , 2022 . The portfolio of our Diagnostics segment comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that we offer to healthcare providers in the fields of laboratory diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics . With a broad selection of diagnostic test settings \u2013 from centralized reference and hospital laboratories to clinical and physician office laboratories \u2013 our comprehensive portfolio covers a range of testing disciplines , including immunochemistry , hematology , coagulation , urinalysis , blood gas analysis , and molecular tests . Siemens Healthineers provides laboratories and points of care with a range of antigen , PCR , and antibody tests designed to specifically identify the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen . Diagnostics \u2019 product range also includes efficient workflow solutions for laboratories and informatics products that are integrated with our offerings to improve provider productivity . Diagnostics generates profits mainly from long-term contracts that include an initial instrument placement followed by ongoing reagent sales , which results in a predictable and resilient revenue stream . The Varian segment provides innovative , multi-modality cancer care technologies along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics globally . Its portfolio is designed to enable clinicians to perform new , innovative radiotherapy and other oncology treatments . Varian \u2019 s Radiation Oncology business serves the end-to-end needs of customers with integrated equipment and digital solutions , and applications that are designed to enable increased access to quality care as well as improved treatment planning and delivery . High-quality imaging and digital solutions and applications enable higher-precision image-guided cancer treatments . The Proton Solutions business utilizes conventional radiotherapy expertise to develop integrated solutions for proton therapy . Effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2023 , this business was assigned to Central Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Business principles 06 Items , under the management responsibility of Varian , given that , in the future , the business will not be actively marketing or pursuing new sales of proton systems but concentrate on maintenance of equipment already ordered or already installed , thereby enhancing system reliability and stability , and providing a high level of service for existing customers and their proton centers . The Multi-Disciplinary Oncology business comprises technology-enabled optimized workflows , clinical services , and consulting capabilities as well as innovative digital solutions and applications for managing treatment and therapy . With a large installed base in its Radiation Oncology business , Varian generates recurring revenue from services and spare parts . On October 1 , 2022 , the Cancer Therapy business will be transferred from the Imaging segment to the Varian segment and will be part of the Varian segment effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2023 . Our Advanced Therapies segment \u2019 s portfolio consists of highly integrated products , services and solutions across multiple clinical fields used in the treatment of diseases . Our Advanced Therapies products are designed to support image-guided minimally invasive treatments , in areas such as cardiology , interventional radiology , and surgery . The most important products in this segment are angiography systems and mobile C-arms as well as a robotic-assisted platform for endovascular coronary and peripheral vascular interventions . Advanced Therapies generates recurring revenues through its strong installed base and customer services business ( service and spare parts ) . Within these four segments we provide comprehensive services all along the customer value chain , among them planning and design , maintenance , operational management , financing , training and education services \u2013 for example , within partnerships with hospital operators , so called value partnerships . Our service offerings include equipment performance management , clinical education and e-learning , asset management , managed departmental services for laboratories and healthcare facilities , consulting and digital health products and services . With our value partnerships , we actively address the trend of consolidation among healthcare providers \uf0e8 A.1.2 Business environment and cover customer needs through a broad and deep portfolio . As the partnerships with customers last for several years , we generate recurring revenues on a regular basis . Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 Against the backdrop of the healthcare trends described in \uf0e8 A.1.2 Business environment . Siemens Healthineers has defined strategic priorities to ensure its competitiveness beyond 2025 . Within our Siemens Healthineers Strategy 2025 , we have successfully completed the first two phases known as Reinforcing and Upgrading . The transformational business combination of Siemens Healthineers and Varian , for instance , enabled us to expand into adjacent markets . At the same time , we have expanded our core business and strengthened our role as a holistic partner for our customers . At the start of fiscal year 2022 , we embarked on the third phase of our strategy . During this New Ambition phase , Siemens Healthineers \u2019 aspiration is to achieve annual comparable revenue growth of 6\u20138 % and annual growth in adjusted basic earnings per share of 12\u201315 % for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 excluding COVID-19 rapid antigen test contribution . The outlook for fiscal year 2023 is shown in the chapter \uf0e8 A.5.2 Expected business development . The goal of the New Ambition phase is to fight the most dangerous diseases worldwide , enable efficient workflows , and enter new growth markets while remaining successful in our core markets . The New Ambition phase focuses on five growth priorities or vectors ( see below ) , and our segments and regions are now executing on the plans and programs they developed for pursuing these priorities . In the Comprehensive Cancer Care vector , we want to expand our leading position in oncology by addressing further customer segments along the entire disease pathway . To this end , we intend to enhance and strongly integrate our radiotherapy and imaging products , build a strong portfolio in interventional oncology , expand our multidisciplinary software solutions and technology-enabled services , and expand our cancer decision support for better therapy guidance . In the Cardiovascular and Neurovascular Care vector , we want to leverage our strengths in imaging and endovascular robotic systems to further enhance our relevance in the field of cardiovascular and neurovascular treatments . The Networked Care & Digitally Enabled Services vector addresses the biggest challenges our customers are currently facing , such as staff shortages , rising labor costs , increasing demand , and rapid technological and scientific progress . Our ambition is to put healthcare providers in a position to provide more patients with better care by improving and automating manual workflows that have previously drained significant resources and given rise to inefficiencies . In the area of \u201c networked care , \u201d we want to become the partner of choice for decentralized healthcare . The China Healthcare growth vector concentrates on what is expected to be the biggest global market in medical technology by the year 2030 . As part of its 14th Five-Year Plan , China intends to adapt not only aspects of its economy and society to new developments , but also its own healthcare and medical technology sector . Our ambition is to strengthen our role as a trusted partner of the Chinese healthcare system and its patients . In the Access to Care vector , we will be focusing on the approximately three billion people worldwide who still do not have access to adequate healthcare today . The main obstacles here are a lack of infrastructure , financial affordability of treatment , and a lack of health awareness . As non-communicable diseases become more prevalent in the coming years , affordable health care will need to cover a broader base than before . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 28 A.6 Report on material risks and opportunities A.6.1 Risk management Basic principles of risk management For us , diligent handling of risks and opportunities is part of responsible corporate governance and supports our pursuit of sustainable growth and thereby increased company value . Hence it is essential to manage risks and opportunities appropriately . Our risk management is therefore an integral part of the planning and implementation of our business strategies . The risk management policy is set by the Managing Board . In accordance with our organizational and accountability structure , the respective management of a business , region or function is obliged to implement a comprehensive risk management system . This is tailored to their specific area and its responsibilities , while at the same time being consistent with the overall policy . Company-wide risk management process and organization ( Enterprise Risk Management Process ) We make use of a coordinated set of risk management and control systems . These support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business . The most important of these systems include our company-wide procedures for strategic planning and management reporting . Strategic planning is intended to support us in assessing potential risks well in advance of major business decisions . Management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses . Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management . Accordingly , if deficits are detected , it is possible to adopt appropriate measures to eliminate them . This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner . Risk management at Siemens Healthineers builds on a comprehensive , interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM ) approach . This approach is integrated into the organization and addresses both risks and opportunities . It is based on the globally accepted COSO ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) framework \u201c Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrating with Strategy and Performance \u201d ( 2017 ) as well as the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) Standard 31000 ( 2018 ) , and is adapted to Siemens Healthineers \u2019 requirements . The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process , our internal control system and compliance management system . They consider the company \u2019 s strategy , the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations , the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important . Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of , and response to , risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic , operational , financial and compliance objectives . The time horizon within the ERM approach is typically three years , and we take a net approach , addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective control measures . If risks or opportunities have already been considered in plans , budgets , forecasts or the financial statements ( for example as a provision or risk contingency ) , they have been incorporated , with their financial impact , in the entity \u2019 s business objectives . As a consequence , only additional risks or opportunities arising from the same subject ( for example deviations from business objectives , different impact perspectives ) should be considered for the ERM . In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities , risks and opportunities including social and environmental factors are identified in a structured procedure . This combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches . While reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle , this regular reporting process is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner . Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood , considering different perspectives , including business objectives , reputation and regulatory matters . The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective management of the Siemens Healthineers businesses and regions . This top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at the management level and are included in the subsequent reporting process , if found to be relevant . Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational levels mentioned above . Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities . The hierarchical assignment of responsibility depends on the significance of the risk or opportunity . In a first step , assuming responsibility involves choosing one of our general response strategies . The general response strategies with respect to risks are to avoid , transfer , reduce , retain or watch the relevant risk . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 34 A.6.2.4 Compliance risks Regulatory Environment As a globally operating and diversified medical technology company , we are exposed to various increasingly complex product and country-specific regulations , laws and policies that influence our business activities and processes . A failure to comply with existing regulations or changed and new regulatory requirements could result in governmental fines and other sanctions , the temporary or permanent shutdown of production facilities , third-party claims , import restrictions and negative publicity . This could affect our ability to deliver , our time to market for certain products or product life cycles and thus lead to unforeseen costs and have a negative impact on our financial position . Further , our business may be affected by new laws and regulations , in particular by those that may govern innovative products and business activities , including services and solutions , such as the use of artificial intelligence . For these new subject areas the regulatory requirements are often not yet defined , or they may undergo future changes whose effects can not yet be estimated . Regulatory authorities including the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) in the United States , the National Medical Product Administration ( NMPA ) in China and regulations including the Medical Device Regulation ( MDR ) and In-Vitro Diagnostics Regulation ( IVDR ) in Europe are especially relevant for the commercialization of our products and services . However , there are numerous other regulatory schemes in practically all jurisdictions worldwide to which we are subject . Risks could also arise from effects of regulations in the area of Environment , Health , and Safety ( EHS ) including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances ( RoHS ) and Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ( REACH ) and other sustainability regulations . We need to comply with and safeguard requirements that will ensure product safety and regulatory market access . To counter the risks mentioned above , we monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas with the objective of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions . Furthermore , we issue internal regulations and guidance , conduct continuous training and communication as well as synchronized implementation actions . In addition , internal and external audits of compliance with laws and regulations are performed . Compliance with Laws In connection with our global business activities , we must ensure compliance with antitrust and competition law , anti-corruption legislation , data protection regulations and other laws . We have established compliance and risk management systems to ensure compliance with requirements . Nevertheless , there is no guarantee that these systems will enable us to avoid all risks in every jurisdiction . There are risks , for example , regarding data privacy violations in the processing of personal data of our employees , customers , customers ' patients , or other business partners . Moreover , in our business environment , there are risks regarding antitrust or corruption law violations and other violations of law . Consequences of violations of the law could under certain circumstances affect us also if they relate to violations by our indirect sales channels or business partners . In addition , a significant portion of our business involves governments and companies with public shareholders . We are also involved in various projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations . This may pose risks from a compliance perspective . Furthermore , we may face compliance risks in connection with recently acquired companies that are still in the integration process . There could also be risks related to violations of other laws and legislation such as export control and embargo regulations and intellectual property rights . All of these risks could result in violations of law with severe consequences and can have a negative impact on our business , net assets , financial position , and results of operations . They could also result in claims for damages , fines or penalties , the exclusion of direct or indirect participation in certain types of transactions and public tenders , and reputational damage . Consequently , we are constantly countering these risks with targeted measures . The foundation for our governance framework is provided by our globally applicable directives . In addition to measures such as general compliance training , our Antitrust Compliance Program , requirements of our Business Conduct Guidelines and Data Protection Program , we have established a global compliance organization . This organization conducts , among other things , audits to identify compliance risks at an early stage . Moreover , by providing whistleblower hotlines and establishing internal and external points of contact , we enable the timely reporting of potential deficiencies or violations to us , authorities or other stakeholders as appropriate . With regard to our business partners , we have established a global business partner management system . This includes , among other measures , a careful selection process , a structured onboarding process as well as training , monitoring and a close exchange during our visits to the customer 's site as well as regular audits with consistent implementation and monitoring of measures taken . To meet the legal and internal requirements for data protection , we have implemented an information security and data protection management system whose mechanisms meet the high requirements of the ISO 27001 extended by 27701 standards , under which we are certified . Assessment of the overall risk situation The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories above \u2013 strategic , operational , financial and compliance risks \u2013 reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure . The most significant risks we are currently exposed to are \uf0e8 Economic , Political and Geopolitical Developments , \uf0e8 Cybersecurity and \uf0e8 Supply Chain Management . Compared to the prior year and as already described in the half-year financial report \uf0e8 Economic , Political and Geopolitical Developments constitutes the most significant risk . In addition , the exposure of \uf0e8 Supply Chain Management increased continuously following developments over the last quarters , making it one of the most significant risks . We consider all other risks mentioned above not as high as the three most significant risks . At present , no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 36 A.6.4 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System Our Internal Control System ( ICS ) and Enterprise Risk Management ( ERM ) are based on the principles , guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board , which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board 's decisions . Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals , the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting , and compliance with the laws and regulations relevant to Siemens Healthineers . Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the regulatory requirements . Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) . Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard \u201c Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance \u201d ( 2017 ) and the ISO ( International Organization for Standardization ) Standard 31000 ( 2018 ) and is adapted to Siemens Healthineers requirements . Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized \u201c Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \u201d ( 2013 ) also developed by COSO . The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS . The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS , both systems are complementary . All Siemens Healthineers entities are part of our ICS and ERM . The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different , depending , among others , on the entity \u2019 s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the specific risks associated with the entity . The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility , based on the group-wide mandatory methodology . Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board . The Siemens Healthineers Risk and Internal Control ( RIC ) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and effective processes for implementing , monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities . It consists of the central RIC departments and those responsible in the businesses , regions and functions . The central RIC departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group . We also have an overarching , integrated ICS and ERM methodology ( RIC methodology ) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined , documented in accordance with uniform standards , and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness . For more information on ERM , see chapter \uf0e8 A.6.1 Risk management . Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject to audit activities by our internal audit function . These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request . At the end of each fiscal year , our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM . This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens Healthineers \u201c In Control \u201d Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings . The purpose of the `` In Control '' Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens Healthineers AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year , to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and report any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities . The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM . The Siemens Healthineers \u201c In Control \u201d Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies . In the quarterly Managing Board meetings , the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated , the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS and ERM . Based on this , the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30 , 2022 . Nevertheless , there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system . For example , and no system , \u2013 even if deemed to be adequate and effective \u2013 can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances . The Audit Committee is also integrated into our control system . In particular , it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the effectiveness of the ICM and ERM and the internal audit system . Furthermore , we have set up a disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and nonfinancial information prior to publication . The integration of Varian into our ICS , which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition , continued in fiscal year 2022 and was completed to a large extent with regard to the most significant Varian entities . The integration measures will be continued in fiscal year 2023 . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 37 A.6.4.2 Compliance Management System The ICS and ERM are supplemented by a Compliance Management System ( CMS ) geared to the company 's risk situation . Our CMS is based on the three pillars : prevent , detect and respond and includes the legal risk areas of corruption , antitrust law , data protection , money laundering , export controls and respect for human rights . It is based on an extensive internal set of rules : The Siemens Healthineers Business Conduct Guidelines ( \u201c BCG \u201d ) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers , external partners and the public . In addition , there are extensive internal compliance regulations , including associated controls , which oblige all Siemens Healthineers employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS . They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information . The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works . Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks . The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools in order to initiate appropriate risk minimization measures . The results of compliance risk management that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the company-wide ERM . The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide . It is part of the ICS and is continuously being further developed and adapted to the current Siemens Healthineers guidelines . In addition , current compliance issues are discussed at management level on a regular basis . The entire CMS is continually adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements . The findings from compliance risk management and compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for further development of the CMS . A.6.4.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM The overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM as part of the overarching ICS and ERM is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner , such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of Siemens Healthineers as well as the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens Healthineers AG as a parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations . Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework ( Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ) , for further information see \uf0e8 A.6.4.1 Internal Control and Risk Management System . At the end of each fiscal year , our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS . Siemens Healthineers has a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined , documented in accordance with uniform standards , and tested regularly for their effectiveness . Nevertheless , there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system , and no control system , including one determined to be effective , may prevent or detect all misstatements . Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally provided conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform financial reporting guidelines and a chart of accounts . They are issued centrally by the Siemens Group and complemented by additional Siemens Healthineers guidelines for business-specific financial reporting topics . Siemens Healthineers AG and other entities within Siemens Healthineers are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code ; the conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code . The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis . Accounting departments are informed regularly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective . The base data used in preparing our financial statements consist of the closing data reported by Siemens Healthineers AG and its subsidiaries . Governance and monitoring activities relating to accounting activities are usually bundled on a regional level . In particular cases , such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits , we engage external service providers . The reported closing data are used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system . The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls . Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2022 Combined management report \u2013 Report on material risks and opportunities 38 Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and regular training . As a fundamental principle , based on materiality considerations , the \u201c four eyes \u201d principle applies and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization . Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items , both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements . In line with our information security requirements , accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access . An internal certification process is executed on a quarterly basis . Management at different levels of our organization , supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility , confirms the accuracy of the financial data that have been reported to Siemens Healthineers \u2019 headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems . The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS , which began in fiscal year 2021 after the acquisition , continued in fiscal year 2022 and was largely completed with regard to the most significant Varian entities . The integration measures will be continued in fiscal year 2023 . Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity as well as our accounting-related ICS and ERM . The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related ICS . In particular , it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated ICS , the ERM and the internal audit system . Furthermore , we have set up a disclosure committee which is responsible for reviewing certain financial and non-financial information prior to publication .

The Chairperson \u2019 s Committee prepares Supervisory Board resolutions regarding the systems of Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation , including the regular review of those systems . As far as this concerns sustainability-related targets , the Chairperson \u2019 s Committee can involve the Finance and Innovation Committee which deals with sustainability-related issues ( ESG ) . The Chairperson \u2019 s Committee furthermore has the task of providing the Supervisory Board with nomination proposals of suitable candidates for election by the Annual Shareholders \u2019 Meeting as new members of the Supervisory Board . It therefore has the tasks of a nomination committee . In preparing these recommendations , the targets defined by the Supervisory Board for its composition are to be given due consideration , along with the proposed candidates \u2019 required knowledge , abilities , and professional experience . At the same time , the aim should be to satisfy the profile of required skills and expertise . The Chairperson \u2019 s Committee has furthermore been authorized by the Supervisory Board to decide on the approval of Managing Board proposals regarding appointment or dismissal of persons in certain management positions at the first level below the Managing Board , and the main principles of the compensation and incentive system for employees . In fiscal year 2022 , the Chairperson \u2019 s Committee had the following members : Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas ( Chairman ) , Dr. Norbert Gaus , and Dr. Andreas C. Hoffmann . The Audit Committee oversees , in particular , accounting and the accounting process . It conducts a pre-examination of the annual financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG , the consolidated financial statements , and the combined management report , as well as the report on relationships with affiliated companies . On the basis of the independent auditors \u2019 report on their audit of the financial statements , the Audit Committee makes , after its own pre-examination , recommendations regarding the Supervisory Board \u2019 s approval of the annual financial statements of Siemens Healthineers AG and the consolidated financial statements . The Audit Committee discusses the quarterly statements and half-year financial report with the Managing Board and the independent auditors , and deals with the auditors \u2019 reports on the review of the Group \u2019 s half-year consolidated financial statements and interim management report .

That is why our priority is a strong Zero Harm Frame - work , which is driven by our essentials , behaviors and principles ( see graphic on Zero Harm ) . The GP Zero Harm Framework intends to promote Zero Harm culture , placing responsibility on each local manager to develop and implement the principles , discuss elements that will be included in their program with their teams , and then reinforce them as part of daily work . With our global EHS reporting tool , we can continuously monitor any con - cerns raised by employees , with each case treated locally according to our reporting process .

The CoC is based on the Business Conduct Guidelines ( BCG ) and Principles of the UNGC . The CoC requires specific environmental , compliance and labor standards to be established across all countries of operations . In June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , we expanded our CoC to include a cybersecurity clause . It now includes the following topics : \u2022 Human rights and labor practices , including ( among others ) : \u203aProhibition of forced labor \u203aProhibition of child labor \u203aHealth and safety of employees \u203aGrievance mechanism \u2022 Environmental protection \u2022 Fair operating practices , including ( among others ) : \u203aAnti-corruption and bribery \u203aAnti-money laundering , terrorism financing \u203aData privacy and cybersecurity \u2022 Responsible minerals sourcing \u2022 Compliance with the CoC principles in the supply chain of the supplier Similarly , SGRE requires its suppliers to comply with its CoC for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , established in line with SGRE principles and values according to its BCG and its Global Corporate Social Responsi - bility Policy . Its requirements aim to ensure that working conditions in the \u2022 Supplier management processes apply strict criteria for selection \u2022 Increased supply chain risks addressed through preventative action \u2022 Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments are an integral part of the supplier qualification process Our supplier network extends across /one.fitted/three.fitted/nine.fitted countries worldwide . As interna - tional regulations for corporate responsibility tighten and global disrup - tions due to conflict , the pandemic and climate change increase , it is cru - cial we manage our supply chain sustainably , transparently and responsibly to make it more resilient . We aim to achieve this through solid relation - ships with suppliers that share our values and are equally committed to the protection of human rights , fair labor practices , anti-corruption mea - sures and the environment . By anchoring sustainability criteria in the selection , qualification , assess - ment and development of our suppliers , we are contributing to the UN SDGs . With approximately /three.fitted/zero.fitted , /zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted suppliers and a procurement volume of \u20ac/two.fitted/one.fitted./five.fitted billion in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted ( fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted : \u20ac/one.fitted/seven.fitted./three.fitted billion ) , we see our biggest contributions to SDG /eight.fitted \u201c Decent Work and Economic Growth \u201d and SDG /one.fitted/two.fitted \u201c Responsible Consumption and Production \u201d . To meet these SDGs , we carefully consider labor conditions throughout upstream production processes and monitor the impact of our activities closely . We have also rolled out a global supplier decarbonization program to further increase transparency around our carbon emissions in our supply chain ( see chap - ter \ue91e Decarbonization ) and address climate protection within our supply chain . This , in turn , addresses SDG /one.fitted/three.fitted \u201c Climate Action \u201d . While it is evident that climate change will have a major impact on global supply chains , it is vital we are prepared for other risks , such as global pan - demics . Since the onset of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted , there have been multiple and ongo - ing disruptions to supply chains worldwide . With the war in Ukraine and a further COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted outbreak in China , the situation has become even more challenging . These events are compounding the existing logistics short - ages and interruptions . Siemens Energy Procurement has been working together with operations and our project teams to mitigate the effects and safeguard customer commitments . By establishing a systematic supply chain resilience and crisis management procedure , we have been able to detect risks early , prepare preventive action and define mitigation mea - sures to reduce risk exposures . An important factor in our risk management is our relationship to our sup - pliers . We therefore have processes and policies in place that aim to ensure suppliers meet specific ESG requirements.Sustainable business requires a sustainable supply chain . We work in partnership with our global suppliers to uphold international standards for social and environmental responsibility.Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/four.fittedsupply chain are safe , that workers are treated with respect and dignity , and that business operations with suppliers are ethically , socially and envi - ronmentally responsible .

For further infor - mation please refer to SGRE \u2019 s \ue91d SGRE Consolidated Non-Financial Statement /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , E/three.fitted . Responsible Supply Chain . Comprehensive supplier management GP \u2019 s supply chain management approach defines strategic procurement processes to sustain the company \u2019 s long-term success , which are overseen by the Head of Procurement , reporting to the Executive Board . The approach includes purchasing materials and services cost-effectively , ascertaining high quality standards along the entire supply chain , identify - ing and exploiting opportunities to create value through procurement competence and fostering compliance and sustainability . The supplier management process in place encompasses an extensive range of procedures and tools to enable transparency and awareness regarding expenses , supplier data and related risks and opportunities in the supply chain . It helps managers leverage the potential of our supplier network . The GP procurement process applies strict criteria for supplier selection and qualification . These include financial stability , quality and availability , together with overriding sustainability criteria , such as con - tractor safety , substance declarations and sustainability self-assessments . In June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP added a cybersecurity ( CYS ) assessment process for all suppliers for which CYS is relevant . SGRE has introduced an upgraded ESG Risk & Performance Management Framework , advancing from risk-based assessments to risk- and impact- based assessments . This framework is composed of several complemen - tary steps designed to accelerate sustainability throughout our supply chain . Based on an initial supplier impact screening , it encourages suppli - ers to provide further details on how they are working with sustainability across their own operations and supply chains . While the framework aims to identify and reward high-performing suppli - ers , SGRE also helps suppliers who are not yet achieving the highest stan - dards but are eager to improve their performance . Accordingly , SGRE will incentivize \u201c best-in-class \u201d and \u201c best-in-progress \u201d suppliers as part of the supplier selection process . As part of Siemens Energy \u2019 s overall approach to decarbonize its operations throughout the entire value chain , we are actively encouraging our suppli - ers to also reduce their carbon emissions . For more information , see chap - ter \ue91e Decarbonization . Risk awareness Using our sustainability risk analysis system , we systematically identify potential risks in our supply chain every year . The cornerstones of this sys - tem are : \u2022 Identification of risks and categorization of commodities \u2022 Establishment of risk levels for individual countries ( determined using sustainability indicators for key areas such as compliance with laws , bribery and corruption , human rights in the workplace , child labor , etc . ) , making use of information supplied by internationally recognized organizations \u2022 Use of different strategic measures , for example , special preparation of projects with large , local procurement volumesTo further strengthen GP \u2019 s supplier sustainability risk management system , we initiated the calculation of social risk hours for our suppliers and their scope of supply . These are working hours in our supply chain that might be exposed to social risks , such as those in the areas of human rights or health and safety . This risk indication is not limited to country risks , but also includes commodity-specific risks . It additionally supports buyers through the prioritization and nomination of high-risk suppliers for conducting external sustainability audits.Cornerstones of our risk analysis systemCategorization of commoditiesRisk levels for individual countries Strategic measures Supplier awards At Siemens Energy , we celebrate our diverse small suppliers with an annual awards ceremony . This fiscal year , Siemens Energy honored four small businesses \u2013 three women-owned small businesses and one minority business \u2013 for their contribution to the success of Siemens Energy by being agile , innovative , responsive to Siemens Energy \u2019 s requests and delivering on time while offering competitive prices . Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/five.fittedSupplier assessment We use Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments ( CRSAs ) , covering all major aspects of the CoC , as part of the supplier qualification process that is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect new standards and regulations . New potential suppliers undergo a qualification process , while existing suppliers are reevaluated every three years . Siemens Energy screens suppliers regarding all aspects of the CoC . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP expanded the implementation of its CRSAs to include all suppliers\u00b9 , not just those from high-risk countries . Compared with fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted , the number of CRSAs increased by /one.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted % to /three.fitted , /four.fitted/six.fitted/six.fitted conducted self-assessments . This can be mainly explained by GP \u2019 s expansion to all countries and for two reasons at SGRE \u2013 a high number of new CoC registrations that increased the number of self-assessments , as well as the rollout of the ESG Risk and Performance Management Framework . Furthermore , we conduct quality audits that include questions about sus - tainability that cover major aspects and requirements of the CoC . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , we conducted /nine.fitted/six.fitted/one.fitted on-site audits worldwide , compared to /four.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted supplier quality audits in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted . This significant increase was due to SGRE \u2019 s integration of Senvion and Adwen and the qualification of a larger range of suppliers . We see external sustainability audits ( ESA ) as the most effective means of reviewing our suppliers \u2019 sustainability performance . Focusing on quality and objectivity , external audit partners conduct the ESAs . We assign repeat or follow-up audits if necessary . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , Siemens Energy con - ducted /one.fitted/six.fitted/seven.fitted ESAs . This number increased from /one.fitted/five.fitted/seven.fitted audits in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted , despite ongoing COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted restrictions . Furthermore , we accepted /seven.fitted/six.fitted ESAs of suppliers where audits have been initiated by other companies . We only accept audits that fulfill our requirements and where the full audit docu - mentation is provided to us . Throughout the supplier assessment processes , we remain committed to the partnership with our suppliers and to helping them improve . However , if problems persist and/or the suppliers do not show a willingness to take necessary corrective action , we remove them from our list of approved suppliers . All local instances of blocked suppliers are reported to Corporate Procurement , where the need for a worldwide block is discussed and decided . In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , no supplier was dismissed , as all suppliers with negative results are collaborating and implementing corrective actions . In addition to the processes described above , we have a \u201c Central Warning Message \u201d system in place . This facilitates a fast , efficient response to viola - tions of the CoC requirements . The responsible Procurement departments at Siemens Energy are authorized to agree on a series of remedial steps with the supplier . Potential misconduct can be reported via the whis - tleblower hotlines \u201c Speak Up \u201d at GP and \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE . There were no cases reported in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . To inform Siemens Energy employees , suppliers and further external stakeholders , GP developed and published a web-based training in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted that explains GP 's approach to promoting sustainability in its supply chain.Reducing supplier emissions in China With reducing its supply chain emissions ( Scope /three.fitted ) in mind , the China Procurement team has developed a \u201c Decarb Toolbox \u201d for Siemens Energy suppliers . The toolbox aims to transfer knowledge and broaden the decarbonization capabilities of suppliers by communicating guid - ance and methodologies regarding decarbonization in their own oper - ations . The toolbox has been shared with /one.fitted/five.fitted/six.fitted suppliers based in China . The team is also working closely with three suppliers to identify CO2 reduction lighthouse projects . Following an initial questionnaire and on-site survey , Siemens Energy provided a comprehensive review of the supplier 's own operations emissions and both long-term and short-term improvement suggestions . The project aims to support our suppliers in their sustainability journey . \u00b9 To be conducted by all suppliers with a purchasing volume > \u20ac10,000 p. a . Procurement in Latin America promoting supplier sustainability A series of supplier sustainability awareness sessions held in May and June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted aimed to inform around /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted suppliers across Latin America about Siemens Energy \u2019 s sustainability strategy and its goal to decarbonize the value chain . The sessions were coordi - nated by a cross-functional team from the Siemens Energy Latin American Hub and included further topics such as compliance risks , environmental protection and inclusion & diversity in the workforce . The Latin American Procurement team received responses from over /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % of their suppliers in the region . Finally , Siemens Energy Procurement in Brazil and Colombia have developed a robust EHS assessment program for service provid - ers to promote sustainability and manage EHS risks during pur - chasing . The program includes a supplier analysis to support transparency , accuracy and compliance with county laws .

Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/seven.fittedResponsible minerals sourcing We are committed to preventing the use of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas in their supply chain that are affected by the risks defined in Annex /two.fitted of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas . To this end , we have a Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy ( formerly \u201c Conflict Minerals Policy \u201d ) in place to provide a uniform , company-wide supply chain management standard . To determine the use , sources and origin of these minerals in our supply chains , we investigate the smelters involved . Siemens Energy is part of the steering committee of the Respon - sible Minerals Initiative ( RMI ) , which provides an assessment program for smelters ( Responsible Minerals Assurance Process ) . When surveying our approximately /one.fitted , /six.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted ( fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted : /one.fitted , /eight.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted ) relevant suppliers , we use the RMI \u2019 s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to obtain the necessary information on smelters producing tin , tantalum , tungsten , and gold ( /three.fittedTG ) . We are actively involved in the Responsible Minerals Assur - ance Process by screening smelters for eligibility and encouraging uncerti - fied smelters to take part in RMI \u2019 s assessment programs . All newly reported smelters are shared with RMI . Based on risk sources identified by the EU , which cover armed conflicts , weak governance and human right abuses , Siemens Energy also conducts a specific mineral risk assessment to identify other relevant minerals apart from /three.fittedTG . After cobalt , we added copper to our supply chain due diligence processes according to the /five.fitted-step framework of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance . In addition to our RMI membership and strategic partnership with the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals , we also became a member of the Copper Mark at the end of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted . SGRE has revised its Rare Earth Due Diligence Program to allow for close sustainability monitoring throughout the whole permanent magnet supply chain . The program aims to foster supply chain transparency and monitor compliance with SGRE \u2019 s Code of Conduct . We are therefore closely collabo - rating with our direct suppliers to identify all relevant indirect suppliers throughout the lower tiers . Based on this transparency , we are conducting sustainability assessments to identify risks and improvement opportunities.Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/one.fittedAnchoring our commitment Our commitment to respecting human rights is written into Siemens Energy \u2019 s BCG , with special emphasis on our company values : caring , agile , respectful and accountable . The BCG are binding for all executives and employees worldwide . All employees must agree to them and are given mandatory web- based training sessions on the guidelines ( see \ue91e Compliance training pro - gram ) . Due to its legal independence , SGRE has implemented its own BCG , which , in line with the group-wide approach and underpinned by a human rights policy , aim to define respect for human rights as an integral part of corporate respon - sibility . To enforce this commitment , employees are trained in the require - ments of the BCG , and the sales team must use evaluation and approval pro - cesses that take human rights into account . SGRE carries out compliance risk assessments ( CRAs ) , complemented by ongoing monitoring and reporting by SGRE \u2019 s Chief Compliance Officer . For further information please refer to \ue91d SGRE Consolidated Non-Financial Statement /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , D/two.fitted . Human Rights . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP further raised awareness of human rights in its busi - ness with a training video on the topic . Following a gap-analysis regarding the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act , our Exec - utive Board as well as the Sustainability Council were briefed on the next steps regarding the implementation of the law . We maintain regular exchange with networks such as econsense , a German sustainability network of internationally operating companies , particularly with a view to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . Respect for human rights in employee relations We are committed to human rights in our employee relations . For more information , see chapter \ue91e Working at Siemens Energy \u2013 Thriving environ - ment through inclusion and diversity , and for safe and healthy working con - ditions , see chapter \ue91e Occupational health and safety . Respect for human rights in the supply chain and in business partner relations Our business partners are required to comply with the Siemens Energy CoC for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , which is based on the princi - ples of the UNGC and the ILO but contains more far-reaching requirements . The CoC particularly emphasizes respect for the basic human rights of employees , including fair remuneration , freedom of association , health and safety standards and prohibition of discrimination , forced labor and child labor . To support our suppliers , we continue to offer training on sustainability in the supply chain . According to our implemented sustainability risk management system , we systematically identify potential human rights risks in our supply chain and conduct supplier assessments . For more information , see chapter \ue91e Sus- tainable supply chain management . Human rights due diligence in customer projects We have a dedicated team that conducts human rights due diligence on customer projects . This is mandatory in the sales phase for projects that meet defined risk criteria , and the process conforms with the UNGPs . Here we rely on external ESG databases focusing on country- , customer- and project-related risks . The results of the due diligence guide the project \u2019 s decision-making process . We are continuously striving to improve our due diligence process . In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted we analyzed the effectiveness of the criteria that trigger a mandatory human rights project due diligence . We thereby aim to capture projects with relevant risks for our business . Transparency and human rights-related query channels We are aware that some of our business activities take place in difficult business environments and are a controversial topic of discussion among our stakeholders . We regularly report on controversial topics via ratings and rankings , such as specific human rights aspects in critical projects . Any violations of human rights associated with our areas of influence can be reported via our grievance mechanisms , including communication chan - nels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system and ombudsperson . Please see the chapter \ue91e Compliance and integrity for more information . Siemens Energy is not aware of any confirmed human rights-related violations sub - mitted via these channels in the reporting period.Dimensions of human rights Human rights in the supply chain and in business partner relationsHuman rights in employee relations Human rights in customer projectsAnnex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/two.fittedCompliance and integrity The compliance system is essential for a company-wide zero-tolerance approach Our zero-tolerance approach requires a holistic compliance system of mea - sures to ensure that business is always carried out in full accordance with the law as well as our internal rules . The Siemens Energy-wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , centering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas \u2022 Our motto : /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Energy , /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Compliance \u2022 Strong ethical culture supported by awareness activities and ongoing communication \u2022 Zero-tolerance approach for compliance violations As we operate globally with customers from a wide range of industries in the private and public sectors , we are confronted with complex regulatory requirements coupled with increasing stakeholder expectations regarding integrity and risk management . In this context , we are committed to a strong culture of ethics and compliance . We pursue a zero-tolerance approach toward corruption , violations of the principles of fair competition and other breaches of the law . When such cases do occur , we take immediate action . We support international organizations that strengthen responsible busi - ness practices , including the United Nations Convention against Corrup - tion and the Anti-Bribery Convention of the OECD . Moreover , we con- tribute to the achievement of SDG /one.fitted/six.fitted \u201c Peace , Justice and Strong Institutions \u201d , which calls on companies to reduce bribery and corruption in all forms . This in turn promotes fair competition \u2013 which benefits innovation-driven companies like Siemens Energy . Anti-corruption measures combined with strong compliance systems protect companies as well as their employees and shareholders from the risk of possible misconduct . Countries also ben - efit from stopping corruption , as corruption impedes economic growth and hampers sustainable societal development . For Siemens Energy , compliance means more than adhering to laws and the internal regulations described in our BCG . Compliance is the basis for all our decisions and activities . Our premise is : /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Energy , /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Compli - ance . This applies worldwide and at all levels of the organization . Conse - quently , compliance is a top management priority . The Legal and Compli - ance department reports directly to our CEO , and our Group Compliance Officer reports regularly on GP and SGRE compliance matters to the Execu - tive and Supervisory Boards.Compliance is a company-wide effort , and it starts at the top . We strive to ensure all our actions are aligned with our values , at every level of the organization .

Preventive measures include the Siemens Energy training program , whis - tleblower and reporting channels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system at GP , the GP ombudsperson , the \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE , our compli - ance risk management system and the respective BCG.The BCG for GP and SGRE set out our internal regulations . They express the values , compliance-related responsibilities and behavioral framework for all managers , employees and Executive Board members worldwide . Internal investigations , including regular and ad-hoc audits , are essential for detecting and clarifying misconduct . Misconduct is met with a clear response and immediate consequences . We continuously update our compliance system to mitigate challenges and risks arising from changing market conditions and our business activities . Holistic implementation of the compliance system Our compliance system combines strong central governance with the work of qualified compliance officers , who aim to ensure its worldwide imple - mentation . The entire management team is required to commit to compliance to ensure that all business decisions and activities conform to the relevant legal requirements and follow our own values and company policies . We expect the same commitment from all our employees and conduct reg - ular surveys on integrity to obtain feedback from them . For example , the global employee engagement survey that we conducted this year at GP includes compliance and integrity topics . Based on the feedback we received , we created a centralized legal and compliance team development approach . In online workshops , for example , employees as well as external partners can hereby present topics from all areas relevant for the function.Compliance training program Our global compliance training program requires all managers and employ - ees in positions with a specific risk profile to complete compliance train - ing . The compliance officers of each company unit identify which manag - ers and employees are required to participate and ensure they attend . We aim to maintain ongoing compliance awareness . In this reporting period , this included ad hoc training in the field of export control to ensure the correct handling of sanctions ( especially on Russia ) and specific aware - ness activities . Dedicated compliance and integrity topics are communi - cated group-wide through continuous messaging on company social media ( e.g. , Yammer ) and through integrity dialogues , which provide a forum for managers to discuss current compliance issues with their teams.Continuous improvementPreventRespond DetectManagement responsibilityOur compliance system : Management responsibility is the focusMiddle East Legal Awards \u2013 Compliance Innovator of the Year Siemens Energy took the award for Compliance Innovator of the Year at the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Middle East Legal Awards . Held in Dubai in May , the award honored Siemens Energy \u2019 s work in conducting anti-corruption training with officials from the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq in June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ( see Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ) . The training was part of Siemens Energy \u2019 s Roadmap for the Electrification of the New Iraq , a series of projects launched to revamp the country \u2019 s ailing electricity sector and provide Iraqis with the reliable and efficient energy necessary for economic growth . Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/four.fittedCompliance risk management We believe reliable compliance risk analysis is key to the success of our business . By identifying risks early , we can make informed decisions on how best to avoid or mitigate them . We design and integrate bottom-up and top-down processes and tools to identify potential risk scenarios and take rapid and consistent action . In this context , the annual CRA was conducted for GP in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . At SGRE , the regular CRA is processed biennially and was also conducted in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . Identified risks were addressed through local and central measures and followed up on in dedicated workshops . CRAs are an integral part of the quarterly updated company-wide ERM that creates further transparency throughout the risk environment . Collaboration with business partners Under certain circumstances , Siemens Energy can be held legally responsi - ble for the actions of its business partners . We counter this risk by taking a comprehensive approach to selecting our partners , by contractually oblig - ing them to adhere to our CoC and by monitoring ongoing collaborations . The CoC is based on the Ten Principles of the UNGC and is mandatory for all Siemens Energy business partners . It covers legal compliance in general as well as our anti-corruption policies , including provisions against anti-competitive practices and conflicts of interest . Our process covers the entire life cycle of the business partnership . Our compulsory company- wide Business Partner Compliance Tool supports the implementation of the process and ensures the documentation of relevant information and activities . We are continuously enhancing our business partner due dili - gence process . We do this by systematically harnessing the potential of big data , using dashboards and analytics to improve risk management.Channels for reporting misconduct We offer all employees and external third parties confidential channels for reporting potential violations . In doing so , they help identify and eliminate misconduct , while protecting themselves and the company against any damage that may result . Such channels include : \u2022 Managers \u2022 Group Compliance Officer \u2022 Compliance department and Legal department \u2022 Human Resources department \u2022 Whistleblower hotlines : \u201c Speak Up \u201d at GP , \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE \u2022 Ombudsperson \u2022 Employee representatives Information on possible violations can be given confidentially and anony - mously . We do not tolerate retaliation against complainants or whistleblow - ers and will treat any cases thereof as a compliance violation . We apply the same principles to reports of wrongdoing brought forward by third parties . Our Compliance department investigates relevant reports based on pre- assessments and takes appropriate actions as per formal company-wide processes . Data privacy The protection of personal data plays an important role in our digitized world . We aim to handle it carefully and responsibly , respecting everyone \u2019 s privacy . Personal data is processed confidentially and only for legitimate , predetermined purposes.September 30 Compliance training\u00b9 2022 2021 Training on Business Conduct Guidelines Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 67,248 60,519 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 94 83 Training on antitrust\u00b2 Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 44,951 43,304 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 95 95 Training on export control Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 62,934 60,154 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 93 85 Training on data privacy\u00b3 Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 64,637 \u2013 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 86 \u2013 1 GP as well as SGRE address the same overarching topics but may vary in detailed content .

Key compliance indicators We respond to all allegations of possible violations of external and internal rules as per applicable formal company-wide processes and take appropri - ate disciplinary action in the event of proven violations . Once we complete a compliance investigation and identify compliance violations , our internal processes provide guidance to ensure we take appropriate action with the employees concerned . We evaluate and define consequences through dis - ciplinary processes at central or local level and systematically monitor implementation . The evidence demonstrates that our compliance system is well-designed and implemented effectively . Based on the nature of our businesses , the environments in which we work and the wide range of different geograph - ical regions , we do not regard the number of incidents as unusual . With respect to disciplinary sanctions , the year-over-year increase in overall number is mainly due to cases in SGRE India . Siemens Energy is not aware that it has been convicted of any corruption , bribery or antitrust violations during fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . Achievements Siemens Energy reached a number of milestones in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . These included : \u2022 Developing the compliance system further by adapting the due dili - gence processes \u2022 Enhancing compliance processes by further modernizing the GP compli - ance tool landscape \u2022 Implementing the Compliance Projects Marketplace at GP to gain new ideas and encourage internal cooperation \u2022 Continuing to develop the compliance training program and improving the onboarding process for new legal and compliance employees at GP \u2022 Celebrating an integrity week across Siemens Energy to raise compli - ance and integrity awareness at GP , and \u2022 Conducting extensive on-site training at SGRE India to raise awareness on compliance and integrity . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted , GP will go live with the Governance , Risk and Compliance Tool that we initiated in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . GP will continue to explore the possibilities of digitalization for further efficiency and to strengthen the compliance moni - toring system . The cross-functional implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act will also be a major task of fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted for GP as well as for SGRE .

At GP , among others , the following measures were taken in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , in addition to the measures established in past years , such as mandatory diverse interview panels to reduce bias in the hiring process : \u2022 The I & D Coalition of Allies at GP was established . It is chaired by the Chief Inclusion & Diversity Officer and meets on a quarterly basis to develop action plans . \u2022 We launched a pilot Female Leadership @ Scale program to accelerate the development of future female leaders ( this is in addition to our Catalysta female development program ) . \u2022 Diversity KPIs are shown and measured across our key succession pipe - lines in a succession dashboard . \u2022 Facility upgrades of /four.fitted/zero.fitted offices initiated ( to be completed by the end of the calender year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted ) to provide a barrier-free workplace for employ - ees and visitors . \u2022 In cooperation with our partner , Catalyst , one pilot MARC ( Men Advo - cating Real Change ) session was completed for our executive team in Europe to encourage male leaders to become better allies for women in the workplace . \u2022 An ombudsperson was appointed to investigate complaints made by employees who feel they have been mistreated or experienced discrimination.SGRE \u2019 s Diversity and Inclusion ( D & I ) strategy is set over a two-year period and cascaded across the business . Strategic objectives are backed by spe - cific action plans . Its efforts have been recognized by the Bloomberg Gen - der Equality Index for the third year in a row . Over the last year , progress was made in a number of areas : \u2022 The D & I Governance Board , chaired by the Global Head of D & I , was founded , and regional D & I councils were established . \u2022 A global program was initiated on preventing workplace harassment and discrimination that includes a formal complaint process and company- wide training . \u2022 New flexible working models ( including working from home part of the week ) and improved digital disconnection guidelines were established . \u2022 An inclusive leadership training was delivered for /five.fitted/five.fitted % of senior manag - ers and a high rate of participation in D & I courses in LinkedIn Learning achieved . \u2022 Equal opportunities plan implemented to increase the participation of women and other underrepresented groups . \u2022 Transparency was created on the gender pay gap by professional category and relevant locations .

Strategic intentOur Inclusion & Diversity approach 01 Equal opportunity We are committed to fair and transparent practices for the attraction , promotion , development and retention of diverse people with different skills , abilities and ideas.02 Belonging We make our mix work by creating an inclusive culture where people feel respected , engaged , able to speak up and be themselves.03 Society & partnerships We work together , internally and externally , with customers and partners to support us in becoming more diverse and inclusive.Three focused strategy drivers serve as the foundation for a global and local program of actionAllyship at Siemens Energy Many people in society still experience discrimination due to their ethnic origin , gender , religion , disability , age , sexual orien - tation , gender identity and/or gender expression \u2013 and it is often in the workplace . At GP , we are determined for this change . To support employees at GP to feel safe to speak up honestly when mistreated , we have launched the Allyship cam - paign . It is a result of discussions from the diversity networks where some members came forward with stories of disrespect or racism . The campaign aims to change the internal culture and transform Siemens Energy into a truly inclusive and diverse company . It seeks to encourage kindness , respect , valuing differences and mutual support.Speaking up against discrimination in the workplace Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /eight.fitted/eight.fittedPrinciple System Measures Achievements Principle 1 Support of human rightsOur Siemens Energy Business Conduct Guidelines ( BCG ) provide the ethical and legal framework within which we conduct our business activities . They contain basic principles and rules for our conduct internally and externally , for example on human rights and labor standards . The BCG are binding for all executives and employees worldwide . The Siemens Energy-wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , cen - tering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas such as anti-corruption , anti-money laundering , antitrust , data privacy , export control and human rights , which are also re\ufb02ected in the BCG . Our actions go beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations ; they include , among others , our commitment to the International Bill of Human Rights , European Convention on Human Rights , International Labour Orga - nization ( ILO ) , Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy , ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work ( in particular , on the following topics : elimination of child labor , abolition of forced labor , prohibition of discrimination , freedom of association , the right to collective bargaining , and fundamental freedoms ) , United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ( UNGPs ) and OECD Guide - lines for Multinational Enterprises . All of our suppliers and third-party intermediaries must sign our Code of Conduct ( CoC ) for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , which requires that these basic rights and principles are also upheld in our supply chain . The CoC particularly emphasizes respect for the basic human rights of employees , including fair remuneration , freedom of association , health and safety stan - dards and prohibition of discrimination , forced labor and child labor.All employees must agree to the BCG and are given mandatory web-based training sessions on the guidelines . Preventive measures include the Siemens Energy training program , communi - cation channels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system at GP , the GP ombuds- person , the \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE , our compliance risk management system and the respective BCG . Internal investigations , including regular and ad-hoc audits , are essential for detecting and clarifying misconduct . Miscon - duct is met with a clear response and immediate consequences . Human rights due diligence is mandatory in the sales phase for projects that meet de\ufb01ned risk criteria , and the process conforms with the UN Guiding Prin - ciples on Business and Human Rights ( UNGPs ) . The results are decisive for the project \u2019 s decision-making process . Using our sustainability risk analysis system , we systematically identify poten - tial risks in our supply chain , including bribery , corruption and human rights issues , among others . The cornerstones are the identi\ufb01cation of risks and cate - gorization of commodities , the establishment of risk levels for individual coun - tries and the use of different strategic measures . Following this risk-based anal - ysis , we have implemented Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments ( CRSAs ) for suppliers in identi\ufb01ed high-risk countries , whereby they are screened with regard to all aspects of the CoC . Furthermore , we conduct quality audits includ - ing questions about sustainability that cover major aspects and requirements of the CoC . We see external sustainability audits ( ESAs ) as the most effective means of reviewing our suppliers \u2019 sustainability performance and therefore increased our target for this \ufb01scal year.Siemens Energy has identi\ufb01ed material human rights topics based on an inter - nal materiality analysis from the following perspectives : \u201c supply chain \u201d , \u201c work - place \u201d and \u201c customer projects \u201d . They re\ufb02ect our value chain and have been sorted according to relevance for our business . Awareness of human rights issues was raised in the reporting period in the Siemens Energy Sustainability Council , for example , the Siemens Energy Exec - utive Board as well as the Supervisory Board were briefed on relevant topics , such as the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . In \ufb01scal year 2022 , 94 % of our employees were trained on the BCG . Around 75 % of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements worldwide . In the year under review , we conducted 3,466 CRSAs for suppliers . Compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 , the number increased by 106 % . Furthermore , we con - ducted 961 quality audits with integrated sustainability questions . Compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 , the number increased by 127 % . In addition , we conducted 167 ESAs , which is an increase of 6 % compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 . When sur - veying our approximately 1,600 relevant suppliers , we use the RMI \u2019 s Con\ufb02ict Minerals Reporting Template to obtain the necessary information on smelters producing tin , tantalum , tungsten and gold ( 3TG ) . \ue91e Sustainable supply chain management , pages 53-57 \ue91e Human rights , pages 60-61Principle 2 Exclusion of human rights abuses Principle 3 Assurance of freedom of association Principle 4 Elimination of all forms of forced labor Principle 5 Abolition of child laborUN Global Compact \u2013 Communication on Progress Siemens Energy has been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact since /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and is committed to its Ten Principles .

A detailed description of climate-related risks and opportunities can be found in our Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ( TCFD ) section in the \ue91e Annex . We are continually taking steps to reduce our sustainability-related risk exposure within the organization and across the value chain by imple - menting risk management systems adapted to specific industries and responsibilities . On the other hand , risk mitigation actions also represent opportunities for our business , for example innovations that support the energy transition and streamlining of internal processes . With ongoing developments in national and international reporting require - ments , we collaborate internally and with external partners to analyze new regulations and standards , voice our position on them in cross-industrial tral to our sustainability strategy . Their feedback helps us respond quickly to dynamic market requirements , global developments and future trends . This approach is in line with SDG /one.fitted/seven.fitted , which calls for a global partnership that brings together governments , civil society , the private sector , the UN and other stakeholders .

That is why our priority is a strong Zero Harm Frame - work , which is driven by our essentials , behaviors and principles ( see graphic on Zero Harm ) . The GP Zero Harm Framework intends to promote Zero Harm culture , placing responsibility on each local manager to develop and implement the principles , discuss elements that will be included in their program with their teams , and then reinforce them as part of daily work . With our global EHS reporting tool , we can continuously monitor any con - cerns raised by employees , with each case treated locally according to our reporting process .

The CoC is based on the Business Conduct Guidelines ( BCG ) and Principles of the UNGC . The CoC requires specific environmental , compliance and labor standards to be established across all countries of operations . In June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , we expanded our CoC to include a cybersecurity clause . It now includes the following topics : \u2022 Human rights and labor practices , including ( among others ) : \u203aProhibition of forced labor \u203aProhibition of child labor \u203aHealth and safety of employees \u203aGrievance mechanism \u2022 Environmental protection \u2022 Fair operating practices , including ( among others ) : \u203aAnti-corruption and bribery \u203aAnti-money laundering , terrorism financing \u203aData privacy and cybersecurity \u2022 Responsible minerals sourcing \u2022 Compliance with the CoC principles in the supply chain of the supplier Similarly , SGRE requires its suppliers to comply with its CoC for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , established in line with SGRE principles and values according to its BCG and its Global Corporate Social Responsi - bility Policy . Its requirements aim to ensure that working conditions in the \u2022 Supplier management processes apply strict criteria for selection \u2022 Increased supply chain risks addressed through preventative action \u2022 Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments are an integral part of the supplier qualification process Our supplier network extends across /one.fitted/three.fitted/nine.fitted countries worldwide . As interna - tional regulations for corporate responsibility tighten and global disrup - tions due to conflict , the pandemic and climate change increase , it is cru - cial we manage our supply chain sustainably , transparently and responsibly to make it more resilient . We aim to achieve this through solid relation - ships with suppliers that share our values and are equally committed to the protection of human rights , fair labor practices , anti-corruption mea - sures and the environment . By anchoring sustainability criteria in the selection , qualification , assess - ment and development of our suppliers , we are contributing to the UN SDGs . With approximately /three.fitted/zero.fitted , /zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted suppliers and a procurement volume of \u20ac/two.fitted/one.fitted./five.fitted billion in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted ( fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted : \u20ac/one.fitted/seven.fitted./three.fitted billion ) , we see our biggest contributions to SDG /eight.fitted \u201c Decent Work and Economic Growth \u201d and SDG /one.fitted/two.fitted \u201c Responsible Consumption and Production \u201d . To meet these SDGs , we carefully consider labor conditions throughout upstream production processes and monitor the impact of our activities closely . We have also rolled out a global supplier decarbonization program to further increase transparency around our carbon emissions in our supply chain ( see chap - ter \ue91e Decarbonization ) and address climate protection within our supply chain . This , in turn , addresses SDG /one.fitted/three.fitted \u201c Climate Action \u201d . While it is evident that climate change will have a major impact on global supply chains , it is vital we are prepared for other risks , such as global pan - demics . Since the onset of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted , there have been multiple and ongo - ing disruptions to supply chains worldwide . With the war in Ukraine and a further COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted outbreak in China , the situation has become even more challenging . These events are compounding the existing logistics short - ages and interruptions . Siemens Energy Procurement has been working together with operations and our project teams to mitigate the effects and safeguard customer commitments . By establishing a systematic supply chain resilience and crisis management procedure , we have been able to detect risks early , prepare preventive action and define mitigation mea - sures to reduce risk exposures . An important factor in our risk management is our relationship to our sup - pliers . We therefore have processes and policies in place that aim to ensure suppliers meet specific ESG requirements.Sustainable business requires a sustainable supply chain .

Comprehensive supplier management GP \u2019 s supply chain management approach defines strategic procurement processes to sustain the company \u2019 s long-term success , which are overseen by the Head of Procurement , reporting to the Executive Board . The approach includes purchasing materials and services cost-effectively , ascertaining high quality standards along the entire supply chain , identify - ing and exploiting opportunities to create value through procurement competence and fostering compliance and sustainability . The supplier management process in place encompasses an extensive range of procedures and tools to enable transparency and awareness regarding expenses , supplier data and related risks and opportunities in the supply chain . It helps managers leverage the potential of our supplier network . The GP procurement process applies strict criteria for supplier selection and qualification . These include financial stability , quality and availability , together with overriding sustainability criteria , such as con - tractor safety , substance declarations and sustainability self-assessments . In June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP added a cybersecurity ( CYS ) assessment process for all suppliers for which CYS is relevant . SGRE has introduced an upgraded ESG Risk & Performance Management Framework , advancing from risk-based assessments to risk- and impact- based assessments . This framework is composed of several complemen - tary steps designed to accelerate sustainability throughout our supply chain . Based on an initial supplier impact screening , it encourages suppli - ers to provide further details on how they are working with sustainability across their own operations and supply chains . While the framework aims to identify and reward high-performing suppli - ers , SGRE also helps suppliers who are not yet achieving the highest stan - dards but are eager to improve their performance . Accordingly , SGRE will incentivize \u201c best-in-class \u201d and \u201c best-in-progress \u201d suppliers as part of the supplier selection process . As part of Siemens Energy \u2019 s overall approach to decarbonize its operations throughout the entire value chain , we are actively encouraging our suppli - ers to also reduce their carbon emissions . For more information , see chap - ter \ue91e Decarbonization . Risk awareness Using our sustainability risk analysis system , we systematically identify potential risks in our supply chain every year . The cornerstones of this sys - tem are : \u2022 Identification of risks and categorization of commodities \u2022 Establishment of risk levels for individual countries ( determined using sustainability indicators for key areas such as compliance with laws , bribery and corruption , human rights in the workplace , child labor , etc . ) , making use of information supplied by internationally recognized organizations \u2022 Use of different strategic measures , for example , special preparation of projects with large , local procurement volumesTo further strengthen GP \u2019 s supplier sustainability risk management system , we initiated the calculation of social risk hours for our suppliers and their scope of supply . These are working hours in our supply chain that might be exposed to social risks , such as those in the areas of human rights or health and safety . This risk indication is not limited to country risks , but also includes commodity-specific risks . It additionally supports buyers through the prioritization and nomination of high-risk suppliers for conducting external sustainability audits.Cornerstones of our risk analysis systemCategorization of commoditiesRisk levels for individual countries Strategic measures Supplier awards At Siemens Energy , we celebrate our diverse small suppliers with an annual awards ceremony . This fiscal year , Siemens Energy honored four small businesses \u2013 three women-owned small businesses and one minority business \u2013 for their contribution to the success of Siemens Energy by being agile , innovative , responsive to Siemens Energy \u2019 s requests and delivering on time while offering competitive prices . Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/five.fittedSupplier assessment We use Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments ( CRSAs ) , covering all major aspects of the CoC , as part of the supplier qualification process that is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect new standards and regulations . New potential suppliers undergo a qualification process , while existing suppliers are reevaluated every three years . Siemens Energy screens suppliers regarding all aspects of the CoC . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP expanded the implementation of its CRSAs to include all suppliers\u00b9 , not just those from high-risk countries . Compared with fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted , the number of CRSAs increased by /one.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted % to /three.fitted , /four.fitted/six.fitted/six.fitted conducted self-assessments . This can be mainly explained by GP \u2019 s expansion to all countries and for two reasons at SGRE \u2013 a high number of new CoC registrations that increased the number of self-assessments , as well as the rollout of the ESG Risk and Performance Management Framework . Furthermore , we conduct quality audits that include questions about sus - tainability that cover major aspects and requirements of the CoC . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , we conducted /nine.fitted/six.fitted/one.fitted on-site audits worldwide , compared to /four.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted supplier quality audits in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted . This significant increase was due to SGRE \u2019 s integration of Senvion and Adwen and the qualification of a larger range of suppliers . We see external sustainability audits ( ESA ) as the most effective means of reviewing our suppliers \u2019 sustainability performance . Focusing on quality and objectivity , external audit partners conduct the ESAs . We assign repeat or follow-up audits if necessary . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , Siemens Energy con - ducted /one.fitted/six.fitted/seven.fitted ESAs . This number increased from /one.fitted/five.fitted/seven.fitted audits in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted , despite ongoing COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted restrictions . Furthermore , we accepted /seven.fitted/six.fitted ESAs of suppliers where audits have been initiated by other companies . We only accept audits that fulfill our requirements and where the full audit docu - mentation is provided to us . Throughout the supplier assessment processes , we remain committed to the partnership with our suppliers and to helping them improve . However , if problems persist and/or the suppliers do not show a willingness to take necessary corrective action , we remove them from our list of approved suppliers . All local instances of blocked suppliers are reported to Corporate Procurement , where the need for a worldwide block is discussed and decided . In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , no supplier was dismissed , as all suppliers with negative results are collaborating and implementing corrective actions . In addition to the processes described above , we have a \u201c Central Warning Message \u201d system in place . This facilitates a fast , efficient response to viola - tions of the CoC requirements . The responsible Procurement departments at Siemens Energy are authorized to agree on a series of remedial steps with the supplier . Potential misconduct can be reported via the whis - tleblower hotlines \u201c Speak Up \u201d at GP and \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE . There were no cases reported in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . To inform Siemens Energy employees , suppliers and further external stakeholders , GP developed and published a web-based training in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted that explains GP 's approach to promoting sustainability in its supply chain.Reducing supplier emissions in China With reducing its supply chain emissions ( Scope /three.fitted ) in mind , the China Procurement team has developed a \u201c Decarb Toolbox \u201d for Siemens Energy suppliers . The toolbox aims to transfer knowledge and broaden the decarbonization capabilities of suppliers by communicating guid - ance and methodologies regarding decarbonization in their own oper - ations . The toolbox has been shared with /one.fitted/five.fitted/six.fitted suppliers based in China . The team is also working closely with three suppliers to identify CO2 reduction lighthouse projects . Following an initial questionnaire and on-site survey , Siemens Energy provided a comprehensive review of the supplier 's own operations emissions and both long-term and short-term improvement suggestions . The project aims to support our suppliers in their sustainability journey . \u00b9 To be conducted by all suppliers with a purchasing volume > \u20ac10,000 p. a . Procurement in Latin America promoting supplier sustainability A series of supplier sustainability awareness sessions held in May and June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted aimed to inform around /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted suppliers across Latin America about Siemens Energy \u2019 s sustainability strategy and its goal to decarbonize the value chain . The sessions were coordi - nated by a cross-functional team from the Siemens Energy Latin American Hub and included further topics such as compliance risks , environmental protection and inclusion & diversity in the workforce . The Latin American Procurement team received responses from over /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % of their suppliers in the region . Finally , Siemens Energy Procurement in Brazil and Colombia have developed a robust EHS assessment program for service provid - ers to promote sustainability and manage EHS risks during pur - chasing . The program includes a supplier analysis to support transparency , accuracy and compliance with county laws .

Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/seven.fittedResponsible minerals sourcing We are committed to preventing the use of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas in their supply chain that are affected by the risks defined in Annex /two.fitted of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas . To this end , we have a Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy ( formerly \u201c Conflict Minerals Policy \u201d ) in place to provide a uniform , company-wide supply chain management standard . To determine the use , sources and origin of these minerals in our supply chains , we investigate the smelters involved . Siemens Energy is part of the steering committee of the Respon - sible Minerals Initiative ( RMI ) , which provides an assessment program for smelters ( Responsible Minerals Assurance Process ) . When surveying our approximately /one.fitted , /six.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted ( fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted : /one.fitted , /eight.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted ) relevant suppliers , we use the RMI \u2019 s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to obtain the necessary information on smelters producing tin , tantalum , tungsten , and gold ( /three.fittedTG ) . We are actively involved in the Responsible Minerals Assur - ance Process by screening smelters for eligibility and encouraging uncerti - fied smelters to take part in RMI \u2019 s assessment programs . All newly reported smelters are shared with RMI . Based on risk sources identified by the EU , which cover armed conflicts , weak governance and human right abuses , Siemens Energy also conducts a specific mineral risk assessment to identify other relevant minerals apart from /three.fittedTG . After cobalt , we added copper to our supply chain due diligence processes according to the /five.fitted-step framework of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance . In addition to our RMI membership and strategic partnership with the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals , we also became a member of the Copper Mark at the end of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted . SGRE has revised its Rare Earth Due Diligence Program to allow for close sustainability monitoring throughout the whole permanent magnet supply chain . The program aims to foster supply chain transparency and monitor compliance with SGRE \u2019 s Code of Conduct . We are therefore closely collabo - rating with our direct suppliers to identify all relevant indirect suppliers throughout the lower tiers . Based on this transparency , we are conducting sustainability assessments to identify risks and improvement opportunities.Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/one.fittedAnchoring our commitment Our commitment to respecting human rights is written into Siemens Energy \u2019 s BCG , with special emphasis on our company values : caring , agile , respectful and accountable . The BCG are binding for all executives and employees worldwide . All employees must agree to them and are given mandatory web- based training sessions on the guidelines ( see \ue91e Compliance training pro - gram ) . Due to its legal independence , SGRE has implemented its own BCG , which , in line with the group-wide approach and underpinned by a human rights policy , aim to define respect for human rights as an integral part of corporate respon - sibility . To enforce this commitment , employees are trained in the require - ments of the BCG , and the sales team must use evaluation and approval pro - cesses that take human rights into account . SGRE carries out compliance risk assessments ( CRAs ) , complemented by ongoing monitoring and reporting by SGRE \u2019 s Chief Compliance Officer . For further information please refer to \ue91d SGRE Consolidated Non-Financial Statement /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , D/two.fitted . Human Rights . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP further raised awareness of human rights in its busi - ness with a training video on the topic . Following a gap-analysis regarding the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act , our Exec - utive Board as well as the Sustainability Council were briefed on the next steps regarding the implementation of the law . We maintain regular exchange with networks such as econsense , a German sustainability network of internationally operating companies , particularly with a view to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . Respect for human rights in employee relations We are committed to human rights in our employee relations . For more information , see chapter \ue91e Working at Siemens Energy \u2013 Thriving environ - ment through inclusion and diversity , and for safe and healthy working con - ditions , see chapter \ue91e Occupational health and safety . Respect for human rights in the supply chain and in business partner relations Our business partners are required to comply with the Siemens Energy CoC for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , which is based on the princi - ples of the UNGC and the ILO but contains more far-reaching requirements . The CoC particularly emphasizes respect for the basic human rights of employees , including fair remuneration , freedom of association , health and safety standards and prohibition of discrimination , forced labor and child labor . To support our suppliers , we continue to offer training on sustainability in the supply chain . According to our implemented sustainability risk management system , we systematically identify potential human rights risks in our supply chain and conduct supplier assessments . For more information , see chapter \ue91e Sus- tainable supply chain management . Human rights due diligence in customer projects We have a dedicated team that conducts human rights due diligence on customer projects . This is mandatory in the sales phase for projects that meet defined risk criteria , and the process conforms with the UNGPs . Here we rely on external ESG databases focusing on country- , customer- and project-related risks . The results of the due diligence guide the project \u2019 s decision-making process . We are continuously striving to improve our due diligence process . In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted we analyzed the effectiveness of the criteria that trigger a mandatory human rights project due diligence . We thereby aim to capture projects with relevant risks for our business . Transparency and human rights-related query channels We are aware that some of our business activities take place in difficult business environments and are a controversial topic of discussion among our stakeholders . We regularly report on controversial topics via ratings and rankings , such as specific human rights aspects in critical projects . Any violations of human rights associated with our areas of influence can be reported via our grievance mechanisms , including communication chan - nels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system and ombudsperson . Please see the chapter \ue91e Compliance and integrity for more information . Siemens Energy is not aware of any confirmed human rights-related violations sub - mitted via these channels in the reporting period.Dimensions of human rights Human rights in the supply chain and in business partner relationsHuman rights in employee relations Human rights in customer projectsAnnex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/two.fittedCompliance and integrity The compliance system is essential for a company-wide zero-tolerance approach Our zero-tolerance approach requires a holistic compliance system of mea - sures to ensure that business is always carried out in full accordance with the law as well as our internal rules . The Siemens Energy-wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , centering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas \u2022 Our motto : /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Energy , /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Compliance \u2022 Strong ethical culture supported by awareness activities and ongoing communication \u2022 Zero-tolerance approach for compliance violations As we operate globally with customers from a wide range of industries in the private and public sectors , we are confronted with complex regulatory requirements coupled with increasing stakeholder expectations regarding integrity and risk management . In this context , we are committed to a strong culture of ethics and compliance . We pursue a zero-tolerance approach toward corruption , violations of the principles of fair competition and other breaches of the law . When such cases do occur , we take immediate action . We support international organizations that strengthen responsible busi - ness practices , including the United Nations Convention against Corrup - tion and the Anti-Bribery Convention of the OECD . Moreover , we con- tribute to the achievement of SDG /one.fitted/six.fitted \u201c Peace , Justice and Strong Institutions \u201d , which calls on companies to reduce bribery and corruption in all forms . This in turn promotes fair competition \u2013 which benefits innovation-driven companies like Siemens Energy . Anti-corruption measures combined with strong compliance systems protect companies as well as their employees and shareholders from the risk of possible misconduct . Countries also ben - efit from stopping corruption , as corruption impedes economic growth and hampers sustainable societal development . For Siemens Energy , compliance means more than adhering to laws and the internal regulations described in our BCG . Compliance is the basis for all our decisions and activities . Our premise is : /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Energy , /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Compli - ance . This applies worldwide and at all levels of the organization . Conse - quently , compliance is a top management priority . The Legal and Compli - ance department reports directly to our CEO , and our Group Compliance Officer reports regularly on GP and SGRE compliance matters to the Execu - tive and Supervisory Boards.Compliance is a company-wide effort , and it starts at the top . We strive to ensure all our actions are aligned with our values , at every level of the organization .

Preventive measures include the Siemens Energy training program , whis - tleblower and reporting channels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system at GP , the GP ombudsperson , the \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE , our compli - ance risk management system and the respective BCG.The BCG for GP and SGRE set out our internal regulations . They express the values , compliance-related responsibilities and behavioral framework for all managers , employees and Executive Board members worldwide . Internal investigations , including regular and ad-hoc audits , are essential for detecting and clarifying misconduct . Misconduct is met with a clear response and immediate consequences . We continuously update our compliance system to mitigate challenges and risks arising from changing market conditions and our business activities . Holistic implementation of the compliance system Our compliance system combines strong central governance with the work of qualified compliance officers , who aim to ensure its worldwide imple - mentation . The entire management team is required to commit to compliance to ensure that all business decisions and activities conform to the relevant legal requirements and follow our own values and company policies . We expect the same commitment from all our employees and conduct reg - ular surveys on integrity to obtain feedback from them . For example , the global employee engagement survey that we conducted this year at GP includes compliance and integrity topics . Based on the feedback we received , we created a centralized legal and compliance team development approach . In online workshops , for example , employees as well as external partners can hereby present topics from all areas relevant for the function.Compliance training program Our global compliance training program requires all managers and employ - ees in positions with a specific risk profile to complete compliance train - ing . The compliance officers of each company unit identify which manag - ers and employees are required to participate and ensure they attend . We aim to maintain ongoing compliance awareness . In this reporting period , this included ad hoc training in the field of export control to ensure the correct handling of sanctions ( especially on Russia ) and specific aware - ness activities . Dedicated compliance and integrity topics are communi - cated group-wide through continuous messaging on company social media ( e.g. , Yammer ) and through integrity dialogues , which provide a forum for managers to discuss current compliance issues with their teams.Continuous improvementPreventRespond DetectManagement responsibilityOur compliance system : Management responsibility is the focusMiddle East Legal Awards \u2013 Compliance Innovator of the Year Siemens Energy took the award for Compliance Innovator of the Year at the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Middle East Legal Awards . Held in Dubai in May , the award honored Siemens Energy \u2019 s work in conducting anti-corruption training with officials from the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq in June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ( see Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ) . The training was part of Siemens Energy \u2019 s Roadmap for the Electrification of the New Iraq , a series of projects launched to revamp the country \u2019 s ailing electricity sector and provide Iraqis with the reliable and efficient energy necessary for economic growth . Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/four.fittedCompliance risk management We believe reliable compliance risk analysis is key to the success of our business . By identifying risks early , we can make informed decisions on how best to avoid or mitigate them . We design and integrate bottom-up and top-down processes and tools to identify potential risk scenarios and take rapid and consistent action . In this context , the annual CRA was conducted for GP in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . At SGRE , the regular CRA is processed biennially and was also conducted in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . Identified risks were addressed through local and central measures and followed up on in dedicated workshops . CRAs are an integral part of the quarterly updated company-wide ERM that creates further transparency throughout the risk environment . Collaboration with business partners Under certain circumstances , Siemens Energy can be held legally responsi - ble for the actions of its business partners . We counter this risk by taking a comprehensive approach to selecting our partners , by contractually oblig - ing them to adhere to our CoC and by monitoring ongoing collaborations . The CoC is based on the Ten Principles of the UNGC and is mandatory for all Siemens Energy business partners . It covers legal compliance in general as well as our anti-corruption policies , including provisions against anti-competitive practices and conflicts of interest . Our process covers the entire life cycle of the business partnership . Our compulsory company- wide Business Partner Compliance Tool supports the implementation of the process and ensures the documentation of relevant information and activities . We are continuously enhancing our business partner due dili - gence process . We do this by systematically harnessing the potential of big data , using dashboards and analytics to improve risk management.Channels for reporting misconduct We offer all employees and external third parties confidential channels for reporting potential violations . In doing so , they help identify and eliminate misconduct , while protecting themselves and the company against any damage that may result . Such channels include : \u2022 Managers \u2022 Group Compliance Officer \u2022 Compliance department and Legal department \u2022 Human Resources department \u2022 Whistleblower hotlines : \u201c Speak Up \u201d at GP , \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE \u2022 Ombudsperson \u2022 Employee representatives Information on possible violations can be given confidentially and anony - mously . We do not tolerate retaliation against complainants or whistleblow - ers and will treat any cases thereof as a compliance violation . We apply the same principles to reports of wrongdoing brought forward by third parties . Our Compliance department investigates relevant reports based on pre- assessments and takes appropriate actions as per formal company-wide processes . Data privacy The protection of personal data plays an important role in our digitized world . We aim to handle it carefully and responsibly , respecting everyone \u2019 s privacy . Personal data is processed confidentially and only for legitimate , predetermined purposes.September 30 Compliance training\u00b9 2022 2021 Training on Business Conduct Guidelines Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 67,248 60,519 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 94 83 Training on antitrust\u00b2 Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 44,951 43,304 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 95 95 Training on export control Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 62,934 60,154 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 93 85 Training on data privacy\u00b3 Employees targeted that completed the module ( no . ) 64,637 \u2013 Share of employees that completed the module ( % ) 86 \u2013 1 GP as well as SGRE address the same overarching topics but may vary in detailed content .

Key compliance indicators We respond to all allegations of possible violations of external and internal rules as per applicable formal company-wide processes and take appropri - ate disciplinary action in the event of proven violations . Once we complete a compliance investigation and identify compliance violations , our internal processes provide guidance to ensure we take appropriate action with the employees concerned . We evaluate and define consequences through dis - ciplinary processes at central or local level and systematically monitor implementation . The evidence demonstrates that our compliance system is well-designed and implemented effectively . Based on the nature of our businesses , the environments in which we work and the wide range of different geograph - ical regions , we do not regard the number of incidents as unusual . With respect to disciplinary sanctions , the year-over-year increase in overall number is mainly due to cases in SGRE India . Siemens Energy is not aware that it has been convicted of any corruption , bribery or antitrust violations during fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . Achievements Siemens Energy reached a number of milestones in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . These included : \u2022 Developing the compliance system further by adapting the due dili - gence processes \u2022 Enhancing compliance processes by further modernizing the GP compli - ance tool landscape \u2022 Implementing the Compliance Projects Marketplace at GP to gain new ideas and encourage internal cooperation \u2022 Continuing to develop the compliance training program and improving the onboarding process for new legal and compliance employees at GP \u2022 Celebrating an integrity week across Siemens Energy to raise compli - ance and integrity awareness at GP , and \u2022 Conducting extensive on-site training at SGRE India to raise awareness on compliance and integrity . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted , GP will go live with the Governance , Risk and Compliance Tool that we initiated in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . GP will continue to explore the possibilities of digitalization for further efficiency and to strengthen the compliance moni - toring system . The cross-functional implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act will also be a major task of fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted for GP as well as for SGRE . In general , we will continue to tailor our compliance system to the individ - ual risks and opportunities of our business and the organizational struc - ture of Siemens Energy . \u00b9 Documentation of the purpose , risk and security safeguards for processing activities within the group.Policies and guidelinesResponse to data privacy incidentsKeeping records of data process - ing activities\u00b9 Training and awareness measures for employeesRespecting data subject rightsTransfer safeguards within the Siemens Energy group of companiesData privacy management systemTo comply with data protection laws , including the General Data Protection Regulation , we have implemented the Siemens Energy data privacy manage - ment system , which aims to ensure the protection of our customers \u2019 , busi - ness partners \u2019 and employees \u2019 personal data .

Strategic intentOur Inclusion & Diversity approach 01 Equal opportunity We are committed to fair and transparent practices for the attraction , promotion , development and retention of diverse people with different skills , abilities and ideas.02 Belonging We make our mix work by creating an inclusive culture where people feel respected , engaged , able to speak up and be themselves.03 Society & partnerships We work together , internally and externally , with customers and partners to support us in becoming more diverse and inclusive.Three focused strategy drivers serve as the foundation for a global and local program of actionAllyship at Siemens Energy Many people in society still experience discrimination due to their ethnic origin , gender , religion , disability , age , sexual orien - tation , gender identity and/or gender expression \u2013 and it is often in the workplace . At GP , we are determined for this change . To support employees at GP to feel safe to speak up honestly when mistreated , we have launched the Allyship cam - paign . It is a result of discussions from the diversity networks where some members came forward with stories of disrespect or racism . The campaign aims to change the internal culture and transform Siemens Energy into a truly inclusive and diverse company . It seeks to encourage kindness , respect , valuing differences and mutual support.Speaking up against discrimination in the workplace Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /eight.fitted/eight.fittedPrinciple System Measures Achievements Principle 1 Support of human rightsOur Siemens Energy Business Conduct Guidelines ( BCG ) provide the ethical and legal framework within which we conduct our business activities . They contain basic principles and rules for our conduct internally and externally , for example on human rights and labor standards . The BCG are binding for all executives and employees worldwide . The Siemens Energy-wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , cen - tering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas such as anti-corruption , anti-money laundering , antitrust , data privacy , export control and human rights , which are also re\ufb02ected in the BCG . Our actions go beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations ; they include , among others , our commitment to the International Bill of Human Rights , European Convention on Human Rights , International Labour Orga - nization ( ILO ) , Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy , ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work ( in particular , on the following topics : elimination of child labor , abolition of forced labor , prohibition of discrimination , freedom of association , the right to collective bargaining , and fundamental freedoms ) , United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ( UNGPs ) and OECD Guide - lines for Multinational Enterprises . All of our suppliers and third-party intermediaries must sign our Code of Conduct ( CoC ) for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , which requires that these basic rights and principles are also upheld in our supply chain . The CoC particularly emphasizes respect for the basic human rights of employees , including fair remuneration , freedom of association , health and safety stan - dards and prohibition of discrimination , forced labor and child labor.All employees must agree to the BCG and are given mandatory web-based training sessions on the guidelines . Preventive measures include the Siemens Energy training program , communi - cation channels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system at GP , the GP ombuds- person , the \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE , our compliance risk management system and the respective BCG . Internal investigations , including regular and ad-hoc audits , are essential for detecting and clarifying misconduct . Miscon - duct is met with a clear response and immediate consequences . Human rights due diligence is mandatory in the sales phase for projects that meet de\ufb01ned risk criteria , and the process conforms with the UN Guiding Prin - ciples on Business and Human Rights ( UNGPs ) . The results are decisive for the project \u2019 s decision-making process . Using our sustainability risk analysis system , we systematically identify poten - tial risks in our supply chain , including bribery , corruption and human rights issues , among others . The cornerstones are the identi\ufb01cation of risks and cate - gorization of commodities , the establishment of risk levels for individual coun - tries and the use of different strategic measures . Following this risk-based anal - ysis , we have implemented Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments ( CRSAs ) for suppliers in identi\ufb01ed high-risk countries , whereby they are screened with regard to all aspects of the CoC . Furthermore , we conduct quality audits includ - ing questions about sustainability that cover major aspects and requirements of the CoC . We see external sustainability audits ( ESAs ) as the most effective means of reviewing our suppliers \u2019 sustainability performance and therefore increased our target for this \ufb01scal year.Siemens Energy has identi\ufb01ed material human rights topics based on an inter - nal materiality analysis from the following perspectives : \u201c supply chain \u201d , \u201c work - place \u201d and \u201c customer projects \u201d . They re\ufb02ect our value chain and have been sorted according to relevance for our business . Awareness of human rights issues was raised in the reporting period in the Siemens Energy Sustainability Council , for example , the Siemens Energy Exec - utive Board as well as the Supervisory Board were briefed on relevant topics , such as the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . In \ufb01scal year 2022 , 94 % of our employees were trained on the BCG . Around 75 % of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements worldwide . In the year under review , we conducted 3,466 CRSAs for suppliers . Compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 , the number increased by 106 % . Furthermore , we con - ducted 961 quality audits with integrated sustainability questions . Compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 , the number increased by 127 % . In addition , we conducted 167 ESAs , which is an increase of 6 % compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 . When sur - veying our approximately 1,600 relevant suppliers , we use the RMI \u2019 s Con\ufb02ict Minerals Reporting Template to obtain the necessary information on smelters producing tin , tantalum , tungsten and gold ( 3TG ) . \ue91e Sustainable supply chain management , pages 53-57 \ue91e Human rights , pages 60-61Principle 2 Exclusion of human rights abuses Principle 3 Assurance of freedom of association Principle 4 Elimination of all forms of forced labor Principle 5 Abolition of child laborUN Global Compact \u2013 Communication on Progress Siemens Energy has been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact since /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and is committed to its Ten Principles .

When such cases do occur , we take immediate action . Compliance is the basis for all our decisions and activities . The Siemens Energy- wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , centering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas such as anti-corruption , anti-money laundering , antitrust , data privacy , export control and human rights , which are also re\ufb02ected in the BCG . The BCG are binding for all employees worldwide . We support international organizations that strengthen responsible business practices , including the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the Anti-Bribery Convention of the OECD . \ue91e Compliance and integrity , pages 62-65The Siemens Energy compliance system combines strong central governance with the work of quali\ufb01ed compliance of\ufb01cers , who aim to ensure its worldwide implementation . The entire management team is required to commit to compli - ance to ensure that all business decisions and activities conform to the relevant legal requirements and follow our own values and company policies . We expect the same commitment from all our employees and conduct regular surveys on integrity to obtain direct feedback from them .

It now includes the following topics : \u2022 Human rights and labor practices , including ( among others ) : \u203aProhibition of forced labor \u203aProhibition of child labor \u203aHealth and safety of employees \u203aGrievance mechanism \u2022 Environmental protection \u2022 Fair operating practices , including ( among others ) : \u203aAnti-corruption and bribery \u203aAnti-money laundering , terrorism financing \u203aData privacy and cybersecurity \u2022 Responsible minerals sourcing \u2022 Compliance with the CoC principles in the supply chain of the supplier Similarly , SGRE requires its suppliers to comply with its CoC for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , established in line with SGRE principles and values according to its BCG and its Global Corporate Social Responsi - bility Policy . Its requirements aim to ensure that working conditions in the \u2022 Supplier management processes apply strict criteria for selection \u2022 Increased supply chain risks addressed through preventative action \u2022 Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments are an integral part of the supplier qualification process Our supplier network extends across /one.fitted/three.fitted/nine.fitted countries worldwide . As interna - tional regulations for corporate responsibility tighten and global disrup - tions due to conflict , the pandemic and climate change increase , it is cru - cial we manage our supply chain sustainably , transparently and responsibly to make it more resilient . We aim to achieve this through solid relation - ships with suppliers that share our values and are equally committed to the protection of human rights , fair labor practices , anti-corruption mea - sures and the environment . By anchoring sustainability criteria in the selection , qualification , assess - ment and development of our suppliers , we are contributing to the UN SDGs . With approximately /three.fitted/zero.fitted , /zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted suppliers and a procurement volume of \u20ac/two.fitted/one.fitted./five.fitted billion in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted ( fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted : \u20ac/one.fitted/seven.fitted./three.fitted billion ) , we see our biggest contributions to SDG /eight.fitted \u201c Decent Work and Economic Growth \u201d and SDG /one.fitted/two.fitted \u201c Responsible Consumption and Production \u201d . To meet these SDGs , we carefully consider labor conditions throughout upstream production processes and monitor the impact of our activities closely . We have also rolled out a global supplier decarbonization program to further increase transparency around our carbon emissions in our supply chain ( see chap - ter \ue91e Decarbonization ) and address climate protection within our supply chain . This , in turn , addresses SDG /one.fitted/three.fitted \u201c Climate Action \u201d . While it is evident that climate change will have a major impact on global supply chains , it is vital we are prepared for other risks , such as global pan - demics . Since the onset of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted , there have been multiple and ongo - ing disruptions to supply chains worldwide . With the war in Ukraine and a further COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted outbreak in China , the situation has become even more challenging . These events are compounding the existing logistics short - ages and interruptions . Siemens Energy Procurement has been working together with operations and our project teams to mitigate the effects and safeguard customer commitments . By establishing a systematic supply chain resilience and crisis management procedure , we have been able to detect risks early , prepare preventive action and define mitigation mea - sures to reduce risk exposures . An important factor in our risk management is our relationship to our sup - pliers . We therefore have processes and policies in place that aim to ensure suppliers meet specific ESG requirements.Sustainable business requires a sustainable supply chain . We work in partnership with our global suppliers to uphold international standards for social and environmental responsibility.Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/four.fittedsupply chain are safe , that workers are treated with respect and dignity , and that business operations with suppliers are ethically , socially and envi - ronmentally responsible . Next to the CoC , SGRE \u2019 s Supplier Relationship Pol - icy , General Purchasing Conditions , and internal rules and procedures all set minimum requirements for suppliers to comply with . For further infor - mation please refer to SGRE \u2019 s \ue91d SGRE Consolidated Non-Financial Statement /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , E/three.fitted . Responsible Supply Chain . Comprehensive supplier management GP \u2019 s supply chain management approach defines strategic procurement processes to sustain the company \u2019 s long-term success , which are overseen by the Head of Procurement , reporting to the Executive Board . The approach includes purchasing materials and services cost-effectively , ascertaining high quality standards along the entire supply chain , identify - ing and exploiting opportunities to create value through procurement competence and fostering compliance and sustainability . The supplier management process in place encompasses an extensive range of procedures and tools to enable transparency and awareness regarding expenses , supplier data and related risks and opportunities in the supply chain . It helps managers leverage the potential of our supplier network . The GP procurement process applies strict criteria for supplier selection and qualification . These include financial stability , quality and availability , together with overriding sustainability criteria , such as con - tractor safety , substance declarations and sustainability self-assessments . In June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP added a cybersecurity ( CYS ) assessment process for all suppliers for which CYS is relevant . SGRE has introduced an upgraded ESG Risk & Performance Management Framework , advancing from risk-based assessments to risk- and impact- based assessments . This framework is composed of several complemen - tary steps designed to accelerate sustainability throughout our supply chain . Based on an initial supplier impact screening , it encourages suppli - ers to provide further details on how they are working with sustainability across their own operations and supply chains . While the framework aims to identify and reward high-performing suppli - ers , SGRE also helps suppliers who are not yet achieving the highest stan - dards but are eager to improve their performance . Accordingly , SGRE will incentivize \u201c best-in-class \u201d and \u201c best-in-progress \u201d suppliers as part of the supplier selection process . As part of Siemens Energy \u2019 s overall approach to decarbonize its operations throughout the entire value chain , we are actively encouraging our suppli - ers to also reduce their carbon emissions . For more information , see chap - ter \ue91e Decarbonization . Risk awareness Using our sustainability risk analysis system , we systematically identify potential risks in our supply chain every year . The cornerstones of this sys - tem are : \u2022 Identification of risks and categorization of commodities \u2022 Establishment of risk levels for individual countries ( determined using sustainability indicators for key areas such as compliance with laws , bribery and corruption , human rights in the workplace , child labor , etc . ) , making use of information supplied by internationally recognized organizations \u2022 Use of different strategic measures , for example , special preparation of projects with large , local procurement volumesTo further strengthen GP \u2019 s supplier sustainability risk management system , we initiated the calculation of social risk hours for our suppliers and their scope of supply . These are working hours in our supply chain that might be exposed to social risks , such as those in the areas of human rights or health and safety . This risk indication is not limited to country risks , but also includes commodity-specific risks . It additionally supports buyers through the prioritization and nomination of high-risk suppliers for conducting external sustainability audits.Cornerstones of our risk analysis systemCategorization of commoditiesRisk levels for individual countries Strategic measures Supplier awards At Siemens Energy , we celebrate our diverse small suppliers with an annual awards ceremony . This fiscal year , Siemens Energy honored four small businesses \u2013 three women-owned small businesses and one minority business \u2013 for their contribution to the success of Siemens Energy by being agile , innovative , responsive to Siemens Energy \u2019 s requests and delivering on time while offering competitive prices . Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/five.fittedSupplier assessment We use Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments ( CRSAs ) , covering all major aspects of the CoC , as part of the supplier qualification process that is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect new standards and regulations . New potential suppliers undergo a qualification process , while existing suppliers are reevaluated every three years . Siemens Energy screens suppliers regarding all aspects of the CoC . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP expanded the implementation of its CRSAs to include all suppliers\u00b9 , not just those from high-risk countries . Compared with fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted , the number of CRSAs increased by /one.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted % to /three.fitted , /four.fitted/six.fitted/six.fitted conducted self-assessments . This can be mainly explained by GP \u2019 s expansion to all countries and for two reasons at SGRE \u2013 a high number of new CoC registrations that increased the number of self-assessments , as well as the rollout of the ESG Risk and Performance Management Framework . Furthermore , we conduct quality audits that include questions about sus - tainability that cover major aspects and requirements of the CoC . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , we conducted /nine.fitted/six.fitted/one.fitted on-site audits worldwide , compared to /four.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted supplier quality audits in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted . This significant increase was due to SGRE \u2019 s integration of Senvion and Adwen and the qualification of a larger range of suppliers . We see external sustainability audits ( ESA ) as the most effective means of reviewing our suppliers \u2019 sustainability performance . Focusing on quality and objectivity , external audit partners conduct the ESAs . We assign repeat or follow-up audits if necessary . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , Siemens Energy con - ducted /one.fitted/six.fitted/seven.fitted ESAs . This number increased from /one.fitted/five.fitted/seven.fitted audits in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted , despite ongoing COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted restrictions . Furthermore , we accepted /seven.fitted/six.fitted ESAs of suppliers where audits have been initiated by other companies . We only accept audits that fulfill our requirements and where the full audit docu - mentation is provided to us . Throughout the supplier assessment processes , we remain committed to the partnership with our suppliers and to helping them improve . However , if problems persist and/or the suppliers do not show a willingness to take necessary corrective action , we remove them from our list of approved suppliers . All local instances of blocked suppliers are reported to Corporate Procurement , where the need for a worldwide block is discussed and decided . In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , no supplier was dismissed , as all suppliers with negative results are collaborating and implementing corrective actions . In addition to the processes described above , we have a \u201c Central Warning Message \u201d system in place . This facilitates a fast , efficient response to viola - tions of the CoC requirements . The responsible Procurement departments at Siemens Energy are authorized to agree on a series of remedial steps with the supplier . Potential misconduct can be reported via the whis - tleblower hotlines \u201c Speak Up \u201d at GP and \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE . There were no cases reported in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . To inform Siemens Energy employees , suppliers and further external stakeholders , GP developed and published a web-based training in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted that explains GP 's approach to promoting sustainability in its supply chain.Reducing supplier emissions in China With reducing its supply chain emissions ( Scope /three.fitted ) in mind , the China Procurement team has developed a \u201c Decarb Toolbox \u201d for Siemens Energy suppliers . The toolbox aims to transfer knowledge and broaden the decarbonization capabilities of suppliers by communicating guid - ance and methodologies regarding decarbonization in their own oper - ations . The toolbox has been shared with /one.fitted/five.fitted/six.fitted suppliers based in China . The team is also working closely with three suppliers to identify CO2 reduction lighthouse projects . Following an initial questionnaire and on-site survey , Siemens Energy provided a comprehensive review of the supplier 's own operations emissions and both long-term and short-term improvement suggestions . The project aims to support our suppliers in their sustainability journey . \u00b9 To be conducted by all suppliers with a purchasing volume > \u20ac10,000 p. a . Procurement in Latin America promoting supplier sustainability A series of supplier sustainability awareness sessions held in May and June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted aimed to inform around /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted suppliers across Latin America about Siemens Energy \u2019 s sustainability strategy and its goal to decarbonize the value chain . The sessions were coordi - nated by a cross-functional team from the Siemens Energy Latin American Hub and included further topics such as compliance risks , environmental protection and inclusion & diversity in the workforce . The Latin American Procurement team received responses from over /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % of their suppliers in the region . Finally , Siemens Energy Procurement in Brazil and Colombia have developed a robust EHS assessment program for service provid - ers to promote sustainability and manage EHS risks during pur - chasing . The program includes a supplier analysis to support transparency , accuracy and compliance with county laws .

Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /five.fitted/seven.fittedResponsible minerals sourcing We are committed to preventing the use of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas in their supply chain that are affected by the risks defined in Annex /two.fitted of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas . To this end , we have a Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy ( formerly \u201c Conflict Minerals Policy \u201d ) in place to provide a uniform , company-wide supply chain management standard . To determine the use , sources and origin of these minerals in our supply chains , we investigate the smelters involved . Siemens Energy is part of the steering committee of the Respon - sible Minerals Initiative ( RMI ) , which provides an assessment program for smelters ( Responsible Minerals Assurance Process ) . When surveying our approximately /one.fitted , /six.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted ( fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted : /one.fitted , /eight.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted ) relevant suppliers , we use the RMI \u2019 s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to obtain the necessary information on smelters producing tin , tantalum , tungsten , and gold ( /three.fittedTG ) . We are actively involved in the Responsible Minerals Assur - ance Process by screening smelters for eligibility and encouraging uncerti - fied smelters to take part in RMI \u2019 s assessment programs . All newly reported smelters are shared with RMI . Based on risk sources identified by the EU , which cover armed conflicts , weak governance and human right abuses , Siemens Energy also conducts a specific mineral risk assessment to identify other relevant minerals apart from /three.fittedTG . After cobalt , we added copper to our supply chain due diligence processes according to the /five.fitted-step framework of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance . In addition to our RMI membership and strategic partnership with the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals , we also became a member of the Copper Mark at the end of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted . SGRE has revised its Rare Earth Due Diligence Program to allow for close sustainability monitoring throughout the whole permanent magnet supply chain . The program aims to foster supply chain transparency and monitor compliance with SGRE \u2019 s Code of Conduct . We are therefore closely collabo - rating with our direct suppliers to identify all relevant indirect suppliers throughout the lower tiers . Based on this transparency , we are conducting sustainability assessments to identify risks and improvement opportunities.Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/one.fittedAnchoring our commitment Our commitment to respecting human rights is written into Siemens Energy \u2019 s BCG , with special emphasis on our company values : caring , agile , respectful and accountable . The BCG are binding for all executives and employees worldwide . All employees must agree to them and are given mandatory web- based training sessions on the guidelines ( see \ue91e Compliance training pro - gram ) . Due to its legal independence , SGRE has implemented its own BCG , which , in line with the group-wide approach and underpinned by a human rights policy , aim to define respect for human rights as an integral part of corporate respon - sibility . To enforce this commitment , employees are trained in the require - ments of the BCG , and the sales team must use evaluation and approval pro - cesses that take human rights into account . SGRE carries out compliance risk assessments ( CRAs ) , complemented by ongoing monitoring and reporting by SGRE \u2019 s Chief Compliance Officer . For further information please refer to \ue91d SGRE Consolidated Non-Financial Statement /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , D/two.fitted . Human Rights . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , GP further raised awareness of human rights in its busi - ness with a training video on the topic . Following a gap-analysis regarding the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act , our Exec - utive Board as well as the Sustainability Council were briefed on the next steps regarding the implementation of the law . We maintain regular exchange with networks such as econsense , a German sustainability network of internationally operating companies , particularly with a view to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . Respect for human rights in employee relations We are committed to human rights in our employee relations . For more information , see chapter \ue91e Working at Siemens Energy \u2013 Thriving environ - ment through inclusion and diversity , and for safe and healthy working con - ditions , see chapter \ue91e Occupational health and safety . Respect for human rights in the supply chain and in business partner relations Our business partners are required to comply with the Siemens Energy CoC for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , which is based on the princi - ples of the UNGC and the ILO but contains more far-reaching requirements . The CoC particularly emphasizes respect for the basic human rights of employees , including fair remuneration , freedom of association , health and safety standards and prohibition of discrimination , forced labor and child labor . To support our suppliers , we continue to offer training on sustainability in the supply chain . According to our implemented sustainability risk management system , we systematically identify potential human rights risks in our supply chain and conduct supplier assessments . For more information , see chapter \ue91e Sus- tainable supply chain management . Human rights due diligence in customer projects We have a dedicated team that conducts human rights due diligence on customer projects . This is mandatory in the sales phase for projects that meet defined risk criteria , and the process conforms with the UNGPs . Here we rely on external ESG databases focusing on country- , customer- and project-related risks . The results of the due diligence guide the project \u2019 s decision-making process . We are continuously striving to improve our due diligence process . In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted we analyzed the effectiveness of the criteria that trigger a mandatory human rights project due diligence . We thereby aim to capture projects with relevant risks for our business . Transparency and human rights-related query channels We are aware that some of our business activities take place in difficult business environments and are a controversial topic of discussion among our stakeholders . We regularly report on controversial topics via ratings and rankings , such as specific human rights aspects in critical projects . Any violations of human rights associated with our areas of influence can be reported via our grievance mechanisms , including communication chan - nels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system and ombudsperson . Please see the chapter \ue91e Compliance and integrity for more information . Siemens Energy is not aware of any confirmed human rights-related violations sub - mitted via these channels in the reporting period.Dimensions of human rights Human rights in the supply chain and in business partner relationsHuman rights in employee relations Human rights in customer projectsAnnex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/two.fittedCompliance and integrity The compliance system is essential for a company-wide zero-tolerance approach Our zero-tolerance approach requires a holistic compliance system of mea - sures to ensure that business is always carried out in full accordance with the law as well as our internal rules . The Siemens Energy-wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , centering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas \u2022 Our motto : /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Energy , /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Compliance \u2022 Strong ethical culture supported by awareness activities and ongoing communication \u2022 Zero-tolerance approach for compliance violations As we operate globally with customers from a wide range of industries in the private and public sectors , we are confronted with complex regulatory requirements coupled with increasing stakeholder expectations regarding integrity and risk management . In this context , we are committed to a strong culture of ethics and compliance . We pursue a zero-tolerance approach toward corruption , violations of the principles of fair competition and other breaches of the law . When such cases do occur , we take immediate action . We support international organizations that strengthen responsible busi - ness practices , including the United Nations Convention against Corrup - tion and the Anti-Bribery Convention of the OECD . Moreover , we con- tribute to the achievement of SDG /one.fitted/six.fitted \u201c Peace , Justice and Strong Institutions \u201d , which calls on companies to reduce bribery and corruption in all forms . This in turn promotes fair competition \u2013 which benefits innovation-driven companies like Siemens Energy . Anti-corruption measures combined with strong compliance systems protect companies as well as their employees and shareholders from the risk of possible misconduct . Countries also ben - efit from stopping corruption , as corruption impedes economic growth and hampers sustainable societal development . For Siemens Energy , compliance means more than adhering to laws and the internal regulations described in our BCG . Compliance is the basis for all our decisions and activities . Our premise is : /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Energy , /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % Compli - ance . This applies worldwide and at all levels of the organization . Conse - quently , compliance is a top management priority . The Legal and Compli - ance department reports directly to our CEO , and our Group Compliance Officer reports regularly on GP and SGRE compliance matters to the Execu - tive and Supervisory Boards.Compliance is a company-wide effort , and it starts at the top . We strive to ensure all our actions are aligned with our values , at every level of the organization .

Preventive measures include the Siemens Energy training program , whis - tleblower and reporting channels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system at GP , the GP ombudsperson , the \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE , our compli - ance risk management system and the respective BCG.The BCG for GP and SGRE set out our internal regulations . They express the values , compliance-related responsibilities and behavioral framework for all managers , employees and Executive Board members worldwide . Internal investigations , including regular and ad-hoc audits , are essential for detecting and clarifying misconduct . Misconduct is met with a clear response and immediate consequences . We continuously update our compliance system to mitigate challenges and risks arising from changing market conditions and our business activities . Holistic implementation of the compliance system Our compliance system combines strong central governance with the work of qualified compliance officers , who aim to ensure its worldwide imple - mentation . The entire management team is required to commit to compliance to ensure that all business decisions and activities conform to the relevant legal requirements and follow our own values and company policies . We expect the same commitment from all our employees and conduct reg - ular surveys on integrity to obtain feedback from them . For example , the global employee engagement survey that we conducted this year at GP includes compliance and integrity topics . Based on the feedback we received , we created a centralized legal and compliance team development approach . In online workshops , for example , employees as well as external partners can hereby present topics from all areas relevant for the function.Compliance training program Our global compliance training program requires all managers and employ - ees in positions with a specific risk profile to complete compliance train - ing . The compliance officers of each company unit identify which manag - ers and employees are required to participate and ensure they attend . We aim to maintain ongoing compliance awareness . In this reporting period , this included ad hoc training in the field of export control to ensure the correct handling of sanctions ( especially on Russia ) and specific aware - ness activities . Dedicated compliance and integrity topics are communi - cated group-wide through continuous messaging on company social media ( e.g. , Yammer ) and through integrity dialogues , which provide a forum for managers to discuss current compliance issues with their teams.Continuous improvementPreventRespond DetectManagement responsibilityOur compliance system : Management responsibility is the focusMiddle East Legal Awards \u2013 Compliance Innovator of the Year Siemens Energy took the award for Compliance Innovator of the Year at the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Middle East Legal Awards . Held in Dubai in May , the award honored Siemens Energy \u2019 s work in conducting anti-corruption training with officials from the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq in June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ( see Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted ) . The training was part of Siemens Energy \u2019 s Roadmap for the Electrification of the New Iraq , a series of projects launched to revamp the country \u2019 s ailing electricity sector and provide Iraqis with the reliable and efficient energy necessary for economic growth . Annex The company Foreword Content Decarbonizing our business Responsible operations Siemens Energy Sustainability Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted Page /six.fitted/four.fittedCompliance risk management We believe reliable compliance risk analysis is key to the success of our business . By identifying risks early , we can make informed decisions on how best to avoid or mitigate them . We design and integrate bottom-up and top-down processes and tools to identify potential risk scenarios and take rapid and consistent action . In this context , the annual CRA was conducted for GP in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . At SGRE , the regular CRA is processed biennially and was also conducted in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . Identified risks were addressed through local and central measures and followed up on in dedicated workshops . CRAs are an integral part of the quarterly updated company-wide ERM that creates further transparency throughout the risk environment . Collaboration with business partners Under certain circumstances , Siemens Energy can be held legally responsi - ble for the actions of its business partners . We counter this risk by taking a comprehensive approach to selecting our partners , by contractually oblig - ing them to adhere to our CoC and by monitoring ongoing collaborations . The CoC is based on the Ten Principles of the UNGC and is mandatory for all Siemens Energy business partners . It covers legal compliance in general as well as our anti-corruption policies , including provisions against anti-competitive practices and conflicts of interest . Our process covers the entire life cycle of the business partnership . Our compulsory company- wide Business Partner Compliance Tool supports the implementation of the process and ensures the documentation of relevant information and activities . We are continuously enhancing our business partner due dili - gence process . We do this by systematically harnessing the potential of big data , using dashboards and analytics to improve risk management.Channels for reporting misconduct We offer all employees and external third parties confidential channels for reporting potential violations . In doing so , they help identify and eliminate misconduct , while protecting themselves and the company against any damage that may result . Such channels include : \u2022 Managers \u2022 Group Compliance Officer \u2022 Compliance department and Legal department \u2022 Human Resources department \u2022 Whistleblower hotlines : \u201c Speak Up \u201d at GP , \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE \u2022 Ombudsperson \u2022 Employee representatives Information on possible violations can be given confidentially and anony - mously . We do not tolerate retaliation against complainants or whistleblow - ers and will treat any cases thereof as a compliance violation . We apply the same principles to reports of wrongdoing brought forward by third parties . Our Compliance department investigates relevant reports based on pre- assessments and takes appropriate actions as per formal company-wide processes .

Key compliance indicators We respond to all allegations of possible violations of external and internal rules as per applicable formal company-wide processes and take appropri - ate disciplinary action in the event of proven violations . Once we complete a compliance investigation and identify compliance violations , our internal processes provide guidance to ensure we take appropriate action with the employees concerned . We evaluate and define consequences through dis - ciplinary processes at central or local level and systematically monitor implementation . The evidence demonstrates that our compliance system is well-designed and implemented effectively . Based on the nature of our businesses , the environments in which we work and the wide range of different geograph - ical regions , we do not regard the number of incidents as unusual . With respect to disciplinary sanctions , the year-over-year increase in overall number is mainly due to cases in SGRE India . Siemens Energy is not aware that it has been convicted of any corruption , bribery or antitrust violations during fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . Achievements Siemens Energy reached a number of milestones in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . These included : \u2022 Developing the compliance system further by adapting the due dili - gence processes \u2022 Enhancing compliance processes by further modernizing the GP compli - ance tool landscape \u2022 Implementing the Compliance Projects Marketplace at GP to gain new ideas and encourage internal cooperation \u2022 Continuing to develop the compliance training program and improving the onboarding process for new legal and compliance employees at GP \u2022 Celebrating an integrity week across Siemens Energy to raise compli - ance and integrity awareness at GP , and \u2022 Conducting extensive on-site training at SGRE India to raise awareness on compliance and integrity . In fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted , GP will go live with the Governance , Risk and Compliance Tool that we initiated in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted . GP will continue to explore the possibilities of digitalization for further efficiency and to strengthen the compliance moni - toring system . The cross-functional implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act will also be a major task of fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/three.fitted for GP as well as for SGRE .

At GP , among others , the following measures were taken in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted , in addition to the measures established in past years , such as mandatory diverse interview panels to reduce bias in the hiring process : \u2022 The I & D Coalition of Allies at GP was established . It is chaired by the Chief Inclusion & Diversity Officer and meets on a quarterly basis to develop action plans . \u2022 We launched a pilot Female Leadership @ Scale program to accelerate the development of future female leaders ( this is in addition to our Catalysta female development program ) . \u2022 Diversity KPIs are shown and measured across our key succession pipe - lines in a succession dashboard . \u2022 Facility upgrades of /four.fitted/zero.fitted offices initiated ( to be completed by the end of the calender year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted ) to provide a barrier-free workplace for employ - ees and visitors . \u2022 In cooperation with our partner , Catalyst , one pilot MARC ( Men Advo - cating Real Change ) session was completed for our executive team in Europe to encourage male leaders to become better allies for women in the workplace . \u2022 An ombudsperson was appointed to investigate complaints made by employees who feel they have been mistreated or experienced discrimination.SGRE \u2019 s Diversity and Inclusion ( D & I ) strategy is set over a two-year period and cascaded across the business . Strategic objectives are backed by spe - cific action plans . Its efforts have been recognized by the Bloomberg Gen - der Equality Index for the third year in a row . Over the last year , progress was made in a number of areas : \u2022 The D & I Governance Board , chaired by the Global Head of D & I , was founded , and regional D & I councils were established . \u2022 A global program was initiated on preventing workplace harassment and discrimination that includes a formal complaint process and company- wide training . \u2022 New flexible working models ( including working from home part of the week ) and improved digital disconnection guidelines were established . \u2022 An inclusive leadership training was delivered for /five.fitted/five.fitted % of senior manag - ers and a high rate of participation in D & I courses in LinkedIn Learning achieved . \u2022 Equal opportunities plan implemented to increase the participation of women and other underrepresented groups . \u2022 Transparency was created on the gender pay gap by professional category and relevant locations .

Strategic intentOur Inclusion & Diversity approach 01 Equal opportunity We are committed to fair and transparent practices for the attraction , promotion , development and retention of diverse people with different skills , abilities and ideas.02 Belonging We make our mix work by creating an inclusive culture where people feel respected , engaged , able to speak up and be themselves.03 Society & partnerships We work together , internally and externally , with customers and partners to support us in becoming more diverse and inclusive.Three focused strategy drivers serve as the foundation for a global and local program of actionAllyship at Siemens Energy Many people in society still experience discrimination due to their ethnic origin , gender , religion , disability , age , sexual orien - tation , gender identity and/or gender expression \u2013 and it is often in the workplace . At GP , we are determined for this change . To support employees at GP to feel safe to speak up honestly when mistreated , we have launched the Allyship cam - paign . It is a result of discussions from the diversity networks where some members came forward with stories of disrespect or racism . The campaign aims to change the internal culture and transform Siemens Energy into a truly inclusive and diverse company .

They contain basic principles and rules for our conduct internally and externally , for example on human rights and labor standards . The BCG are binding for all executives and employees worldwide . The Siemens Energy-wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , cen - tering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas such as anti-corruption , anti-money laundering , antitrust , data privacy , export control and human rights , which are also re\ufb02ected in the BCG . Our actions go beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations ; they include , among others , our commitment to the International Bill of Human Rights , European Convention on Human Rights , International Labour Orga - nization ( ILO ) , Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy , ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work ( in particular , on the following topics : elimination of child labor , abolition of forced labor , prohibition of discrimination , freedom of association , the right to collective bargaining , and fundamental freedoms ) , United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ( UNGPs ) and OECD Guide - lines for Multinational Enterprises . All of our suppliers and third-party intermediaries must sign our Code of Conduct ( CoC ) for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries , which requires that these basic rights and principles are also upheld in our supply chain . The CoC particularly emphasizes respect for the basic human rights of employees , including fair remuneration , freedom of association , health and safety stan - dards and prohibition of discrimination , forced labor and child labor.All employees must agree to the BCG and are given mandatory web-based training sessions on the guidelines . Preventive measures include the Siemens Energy training program , communi - cation channels such as our \u201c Speak Up \u201d reporting system at GP , the GP ombuds- person , the \u201c Integrity Hotline \u201d at SGRE , our compliance risk management system and the respective BCG . Internal investigations , including regular and ad-hoc audits , are essential for detecting and clarifying misconduct . Miscon - duct is met with a clear response and immediate consequences . Human rights due diligence is mandatory in the sales phase for projects that meet de\ufb01ned risk criteria , and the process conforms with the UN Guiding Prin - ciples on Business and Human Rights ( UNGPs ) . The results are decisive for the project \u2019 s decision-making process . Using our sustainability risk analysis system , we systematically identify poten - tial risks in our supply chain , including bribery , corruption and human rights issues , among others . The cornerstones are the identi\ufb01cation of risks and cate - gorization of commodities , the establishment of risk levels for individual coun - tries and the use of different strategic measures . Following this risk-based anal - ysis , we have implemented Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments ( CRSAs ) for suppliers in identi\ufb01ed high-risk countries , whereby they are screened with regard to all aspects of the CoC . Furthermore , we conduct quality audits includ - ing questions about sustainability that cover major aspects and requirements of the CoC . We see external sustainability audits ( ESAs ) as the most effective means of reviewing our suppliers \u2019 sustainability performance and therefore increased our target for this \ufb01scal year.Siemens Energy has identi\ufb01ed material human rights topics based on an inter - nal materiality analysis from the following perspectives : \u201c supply chain \u201d , \u201c work - place \u201d and \u201c customer projects \u201d . They re\ufb02ect our value chain and have been sorted according to relevance for our business . Awareness of human rights issues was raised in the reporting period in the Siemens Energy Sustainability Council , for example , the Siemens Energy Exec - utive Board as well as the Supervisory Board were briefed on relevant topics , such as the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act . In \ufb01scal year 2022 , 94 % of our employees were trained on the BCG . Around 75 % of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements worldwide . In the year under review , we conducted 3,466 CRSAs for suppliers . Compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 , the number increased by 106 % . Furthermore , we con - ducted 961 quality audits with integrated sustainability questions . Compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 , the number increased by 127 % . In addition , we conducted 167 ESAs , which is an increase of 6 % compared to \ufb01scal year 2021 . When sur - veying our approximately 1,600 relevant suppliers , we use the RMI \u2019 s Con\ufb02ict Minerals Reporting Template to obtain the necessary information on smelters producing tin , tantalum , tungsten and gold ( 3TG ) . \ue91e Sustainable supply chain management , pages 53-57 \ue91e Human rights , pages 60-61Principle 2 Exclusion of human rights abuses Principle 3 Assurance of freedom of association Principle 4 Elimination of all forms of forced labor Principle 5 Abolition of child laborUN Global Compact \u2013 Communication on Progress Siemens Energy has been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact since /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and is committed to its Ten Principles .

When such cases do occur , we take immediate action . Compliance is the basis for all our decisions and activities . The Siemens Energy- wide compliance approach is based on the three levels of action \u201c prevent , detect , respond \u201d , centering around management \u2019 s responsibility and comprising focus areas such as anti-corruption , anti-money laundering , antitrust , data privacy , export control and human rights , which are also re\ufb02ected in the BCG . The BCG are binding for all employees worldwide .

The committee considered the audit of the remuneration report and recommended that the\nSupervisory Board engage the auditor KPMG to check the accuracy of the content of the remuneration report\nfor the 2022 reporting year under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in addition to ensuring that it\nmeets the legal requirements set out in Art. 162 (3) AktG. The committee reviewed the appropriateness of the\nstructure of the remuneration system for the Board of Managing Directors and examined the structure and\nappropriateness of the employee remuneration systems for Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. The committee\nalso updated the organisational guideline for the remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors of\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and addressed the issue of equality between women and men in respect of\nremuneration at the Bank.\nIn addition, the committee assessed the impact of the remuneration systems on the Bank\u2019s risk, capital and\nliquidity situation and monitored whether the remuneration systems are aligned with the Bank\u2019s business and\nrisk strategy. The committee also reviewed the principles of the employee remuneration system used to\nmeasure remuneration parameters, performance contributions and performance and retention periods, and\nmonitored the process used to identify institution risk bearers and Group risk bearers. Finally, the committee\nreviewed the remuneration system for the control units and monitored the involvement of the control units\nand all other relevant areas in the design of the employee remuneration system.\nThe Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (ESG Committee) was established as a new\ncommittee at the Supervisory Board meeting on 16 February 2022. Its main function is to assist the\nSupervisory Board in its ongoing assessment of whether the Board of Managing Directors is ensuring the\neconomically viable and sustainable performance of the Bank while also observing the principles of\nresponsible corporate governance, fulfilling the Bank\u2019s social responsibilities and at the same time conserving\nnatural resources. The committee met three times in the year under review. It addressed the sustainability\nstrategy, the ESG framework and the status of regulatory requirements. It also received reports on general\nlitigation and liability risks in connection with ESG. It considered the Bank\u2019s sustainability reporting in detail\nand provided suggestions as part of the preparation of Commerzbank\u2019s combined separate non-financial\nreport. The committee discussed the communications strategy with a view to achieving a sharper profile as a\nsustainable company. In addition, it discussed interim targets under the Science Based Targets Initiative and\nreceived a report on the current status of employee training on the ESG principles at Commerzbank. It also\ndeliberated the implementation of the \u201cStrategy 2024\u201d programme in human resources terms, the\nimplementation of diversity and personnel measures in connection with \u201cStrategy 2024\u201d and issues relating\nto diversity management, the optimisation of the working environment at Commerzbank and general HR\nmetrics. The committee also discussed new training and qualification measures. The ESG Committee also\nreceived reports on the current status of coronavirus measures at Commerzbank, the Bank\u2019s hygiene concept\nand the various measures implemented in connection with the coronavirus.\nThe Digital Transformation Committee assists the Supervisory Board with its monitoring and advisory\ntasks relating to the Bank\u2019s digital transformation and IT; it met four times in 2022. It regularly scrutinised the\nstatus of the progress made with digitalisation at the Bank in the context of \u201cStrategy 2024\u201d. Road maps for\nthe business divisions formed the basis for this and were consolidated by adding aspects such as\nmeasurability by means of key performance indicators. Based on the Bank\u2019s strategy, it examined the IT\nstrategy for 2023 to 2026. The committee received regular information on the current status of IT and on the\noverall technical performance and stability of the IT systems, as well as updates on key strategic initiatives. To\nthis end, the committee received reports on projects and processes relating to the Bank\u2019s digital\ntransformation, its budget management and transformation management, and the status of individual\nprojects. The committee looked at the Bank\u2019s IT architecture and IT landscape and at the current\ndevelopments on the fintech market. Looking to the future, it also discussed crypto custody business, To our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 13\n2 Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors\n5 Board of Managing Directors\n6 Report of the Supervisory Board\n17 Committees and the Supervisory Board\n20 Our share\nmachine learning, the artificial intelligence strategy and distributed ledger-based platforms.\nIn addition, the committee was informed about the IT target state for securities processes and the\nintroduction of vendor management as a central functional interface in the delivery organisation for IT\nservices and management consulting.\nThere was no need for any meetings of the Conciliation Committee formed in accordance with the\nGerman Codetermination Act.\nThe chairs of the committees regularly reported on their work at the next meeting of the plenary Supervisory\nBoard.\nConflicts of interest\nIn accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code and Art. 3 (6) of the rules of procedure of the\nSupervisory Board, members of Commerzbank\u2019s Supervisory Board are required to disclose conflicts of\ninterest without delay to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chairman\u2019s deputy, who will in turn\ninform the Supervisory Board. No member of the Supervisory Board declared a conflict of interest during the\nyear under review.\nTraining and development measures\nThe members of the Supervisory Board undertook the training and development measures required for their\nduties at their own initiative, with appropriate support from Commerzbank. Further training and development\ntook place on a regular basis. Two extensive workshops on the subject of ESG were held in 2022. A\npresentation on digital assets and crypto custody and their implementation within the Bank was also given to\nthe Supervisory Board following one of its meetings. The topics of mainframes, the cloud and working\nmethods/working architecture for new ways of working were covered in the Digital Transformation\nCommittee. In addition, an internal training session on the subject of litigation and liability risks in connection\nwith ESG was held as part of one of the meetings of the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee.\nMembers of the Supervisory Board also attended external training courses on topics such as sustainable\nfinance and ESG in a sustainable finance context.\nEvaluation and self-assessment\nIn the 2022 financial year the Supervisory Board and its committees dealt with the results of the review of the\neffectiveness of their work carried out in the 2021 financial year in accordance with recommendation D.12 of\nthe German Corporate Governance Code, combined with the assessment to be carried out in accordance with\nArt. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German Banking Act (KWG). Both the Supervisory Board and the individual\ncommittees drew up a catalogue of measures based on the results and implemented these measures. At the\nend of the 2022 financial year, the Supervisory Board reviewed the effectiveness of its work in the 2022\nfinancial year and carried out the assessment required pursuant to Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German\nBanking Act (KWG). For this purpose all members of the Supervisory Board completed various\nquestionnaires, which were then analysed. The resulting analyses were presented to the plenary session for\ndiscussion at the start of 2023. On the basis of these discussions, catalogues of measures were drawn up both\nin plenary sessions and in the committees, and these are being worked through in a timely manner. The\nmembers of the Supervisory Board believe that the board and its committees work effectively and to a high\nstandard overall. 32 \nWith Burkhard Keese as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Robin J. Stalker, who is also a member of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board has two members with special expertise in the areas of both accounting and auditing. Other members of the Audit Committee also have special expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing. Robin J. Stalker and other members of the Supervisory Board also have special expertise in the field of ESG. In order to remain aligned with developments within Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in matters of sustainability and also to ensure that the growing requirements and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board in this area are properly complied with, at the beginning of 2022 the Supervisory Board added environmental and governance matters to the work of the Social Welfare Committee, renamed it the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee accordingly and increased the number of members.\nFor further information on the individual members of the Supervisory Board, please also refer to their curricula vitae, which are available on the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft website.\nIn accordance with recommendation C.1 of the Code, the declaration on corporate governance should also provide information on what, in the view of the shareholder representatives, is the appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives serving on the Supervisory Board and the names of these members. According to recommendation C.6 of the Code, a Supervisory Board member is considered as independent if he or she is independent of the Bank and its Board of Managing Directors and independent of any controlling shareholder. A Supervisory Board member is independent of the Bank and its Board of Managing Directors if he or she has no personal or business relationship with the Bank or its Board of Managing Directors that may lead to a significant, non-transient conflict of interest. When assessing the independence of their members according to recommendation C.7 of the Code, the shareholder representatives should in particular take into account whether the Supervisory Board member him or herself or a close relative of the Supervisory Board member was a member of the Bank\u2019s Board of Managing Directors in the two years before his or her appointment; currently has or had in the year leading up to his or her appointment a material business relationship with the Bank or one of its dependent companies, either directly or as a shareholder or in a responsible function of a non-Group company; is a close relative of a member of the Board of Managing Directors; or has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years. In addition, in accordance with recommendation C.11 of the Code, the Supervisory Board should not include more than two former members of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft.\nBased on the above criteria, all ten shareholder representatives can be classified as \u201cindependent\u201d within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code, namely Helmut Gottschalk, Dr. Frank Czichowski, Sabine U. Dietrich, Dr. Jutta A. D\u00f6nges, Burkhard Keese, Daniela Mattheus, Caroline Seifert, Robin J. Stalker, Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and Frank Westhoff. Dr. Jutta\nA. D\u00f6nges and Dr. Frank Czichowski were proposed for election to the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft at the suggestion of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, represented by the Federal Republic of Germany \u2013 Finanzagentur GmbH. The Financial Market Stabilisation Fund holds around 15.6% of the share capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and is therefore not a controlling shareholder within the meaning of the Code. Nor does the Federal Republic of Germany \u2013 Finance Agency have a material business relationship with Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. In addition, there is no former member of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft on the Supervisory Board.\nAs a result, the target of always having at least eight independent Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting has been achieved. The Supervisory Board\u2019s own assessment that it contains an appropriate number of independent members is therefore well-founded.\nIn the 2022 financial year the Supervisory Board and its committees dealt with the results of the review of the effectiveness of their work carried out in the 2021 financial year in accordance with recommendation D.12 of the German Corporate Governance Code, combined with the assessment of the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board to be carried out in accordance with Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German Banking Act (KWG). Both the Supervisory Board and the individual committees drew up a catalogue of measures based on the results and implemented these measures; in the case of the Supervisory Board, these related to matters including qualification and ongoing training of Supervisory Board members, anchoring of ESG matters in the Supervisory Board, and efficient communication between the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board. At the end of the 2022 financial year, the Supervisory Board then reviewed the effectiveness of its work in the 2022 financial year and carried out the assessment required pursuant to Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German Banking Act (KWG). For this purpose all members of the Supervisory Board completed various questionnaires, which were then analysed. The resulting analyses were presented to the Supervisory Board for discussion at the start of 2023. On the basis of these discussions, catalogues of measures were drawn up both by the Supervisory Board and in the committees, and these are being worked through in a timely manner. The members of the Supervisory Board believe that the board and its committees work effectively and to a high standard overall.\nIn accordance with recommendation E.2 of the Code and Art. 3 (6) of the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, each member of the Supervisory Board must disclose any conflicts of interest. No member of the Supervisory Board declared such a conflict of interest during the year under review.\nIn accordance with recommendation B.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board works with the Board of Managing Directors to ensure long-term succession\nplanning for the Board of Managing Directors, which also includes measures to ensure they can respond appropriately to any short-term staffing changes (such as resignations for personal reasons). The Presiding and Nomination Committee of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s Supervisory Board is responsible for succession planning. It assists the Supervisory Board in selecting applicants for positions on the Board of Managing Directors. Therefore, it takes account of the balance and range of knowledge, skills and experience of all the board members and draws up a job description with an applicant profile. In drawing up the job description, it takes account of the skills profile and suitability matrix for the Board of Managing Directors as well as other targets for its composition (such as diversity). In accordance with Art. 25 (11) no. 5 of the German Banking Act, the Presiding and Nomination Committee also reviews the principles of the Board of Managing Directors for the selection and appointment of persons at top management level. It also determines whether there are suitable succession candidates at this level for appointment to the Board of Managing Directors.\nThe system for the remuneration of Supervisory Board members adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 13 May 2020 and applicable since 1January 2020, which is governed by Commerzbank\u2019s Articles of Association, was amended by the Annual General Meeting in 2022 with regard to remuneration for membership of committees and was therefore adopted again in accordance with Art. 113 (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The resolution was published on the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft website. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is also presented in detail in the remuneration report, which is published on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s website.\nDiversity\nBoth Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Group companies take diversity into account in the composition of the Board of Managing Directors, appointments to management and recommendations for the election of Supervisory Board members (recommendations A.2, B.1 and C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code). The aim is to reduce the risk of prejudice and \u201cgroupthink\u201d. In addition, diversity contributes to a broader range of experience and a greater spectrum of knowledge, capabilities and expertise.\nDiversity policy and information on the minimum proportions of women and men on the Supervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft consists of 20 members. As already mentioned in the description of the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board is supposed to always have at least eight\nmembers elected by the Annual General Meeting who are independent (shareholder representatives) as defined in recommendations C.6, C.7 and C.8 of the Code. In accordance with recommendation C.2 of the Code, the Supervisory Board has also defined an age limit for Supervisory Board members by setting a standard limit of 72 years of age. The Supervisory Board aims to have a broad range of ages represented on the board. The Supervisory Board also wants its members to have a suitable range of educational and professional backgrounds and for the board to have at least one international member at all times. The Supervisory Board also considers appropriate female and male representation when proposing candidates to the Annual General Meeting for election. The Supervisory Board is committed to exceeding the statutory minimum requirement for female and male representation of at least 30% each. Thereby it has to be considered that the only way the Supervisory Board is able to influence its composition is by the candidates it proposes to the Annual General Meeting for election. The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board are also striving to exceed female and male representation of at least 30% each among employee representatives in future.\nThe Supervisory Board achieved all the stated goals in the 2022 financial year. As at 31 December 2022, with Dr. Gertrude Tumpel- Gugerell and Robin J. Stalker, the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft included two international members and nine women, five of whom were shareholder representatives. The percentage of women on the Supervisory Board is therefore 45% at present, while the proportion of men is 55%.\nWhere required by law, the Group companies have also set their own targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory boards.\nThe members of the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are between 49 and 71 years old; the average age is 57.4. The educational and professional backgrounds of the Supervisory Board members are varied: there are members of the Supervisory Board with banking training, lawyers, members with business degrees, and engineers. Many members of the Supervisory Board have significant banking experience.\nDiversity policy and minimum proportions on the Board of Managing Directors\nIn making appointments to the Board of Managing Directors, the Supervisory Board aims to increase diversity, particularly with regard to age, origin, education and professional background, and to give appropriate consideration to women. As a rule, the members of the Board of Managing Directors should not be over 65 years of age. In addition, the Supervisory Board ensures that the members of the Board of Managing Directors have a suitable range of educational and professional backgrounds.\nThe Supervisory Board had set a target of at least one female member by 31 December 2021. This target was met ahead of schedule on 1 November 2017, and has been exceeded since 1\n34 \nJanuary 2020 with two women on the Board of Managing Directors. This means that the minimum proportions under Art. 76 (3a) of the German Stock Corporation Act have been met and indeed exceeded, according to which a Board of Managing Directors consisting of more than three people must have at least one woman and at least one man among its members. The Supervisory Board will strive to continue to exceed the statutory minimum proportions in the future. The proportion of women on the Board of Managing Directors was 28.6% as at 31 December 2022.\nWhere required by law, the Group companies have also set their own targets for the proportion of women on their management boards.\nTargets for the first and second levels of management\nArt. 76 (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft to set a target for female representation at the two management levels below the Board of Managing Directors and a deadline for achieving this target.\nThe Board of Managing Directors last set new targets for female representation at the first and second levels of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s management (in Germany) in December 2021. The target is 25% for the first management level and likewise 25% for the second level. The deadline set for achieving the targets is 31 December 2026. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has thus given itself ambitious targets. It is an important objective for the Bank and the Group as a whole to further increase the number of women in management positions.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the first management level below the Board of Managing Directors at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft consisted of 39 managers, of whom 33 were male and 6 female. The percentage of women in the first level of management below the Board of Managing Directors was therefore 15.4%.\nThe second management level below the Board of Managing Directors consisted of 320 people, of whom 247 were male and 73female. The percentage of women in the second level of management below the Board of Managing Directors was thus 22.8%.\nThe Board of Managing Directors chose not to set targets for the first and second levels of management at Group level. Instead, the individual Group companies have set their own targets within the statutory framework.\nIn the Group, the first management level below the Board of Managing Directors consisted of 41 people, of whom 35 were male and 6 female. The percentage of women at the first management level below the Board of Managing Directors as at the reporting date was therefore 14.6%.\nThe second management level below the Board of Managing Directors consisted of 363 people, of whom 287 were male and 76 female. The percentage of women in the second level of\nmanagement below the Board of Managing Directors was therefore 20.9%.\nAccounting\nAccounting at the Commerzbank Group and Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with the respective accounting standards. The Group financial statements and Group management report are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and applicable in the EU (IFRS) and the supplementary provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB); the parent company financial statements and management report of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code. The Group financial statements and parent company financial statements are prepared by the Board of Managing Directors and approved by the Supervisory Board. The audit is performed by the auditor elected by the Annual General Meeting.\nThe Group management report also includes a detailed risk report, providing information on the Bank\u2019s responsible handling of the various types of risk. It may be found on pages 106 to 150 of this Annual Report.\nDuring the financial year, shareholders and third parties receive additional information about the course of business by means of the interim report as at 30 June and interim financial information as at 31 March and 30 September. The interim report as at 30 June is also prepared in accordance with IFRS. In the interim financial information as at 31 March and 30 September, the statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and statement of changes in equity are prepared in accordance with the applicable IFRS accounting, measurement and consolidation principles for interim reporting.\nShareholder relations, transparency and communication\nThe Annual General Meeting of shareholders takes place once a year. It decides on the appropriation of distributable profit (if any) and approves the actions of the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board, the appointment of the auditors and any amendments to the Articles of Association.\nIf necessary, it authorises the Board of Managing Directors to undertake capital-raising measures and approves the conclusion of profit and loss transfer agreements. Each share entitles the holder to one vote.\nhe Supervisory Board submitted a remuneration system for the members of the Board of Managing Directors to the 2022 Annual General Meeting for approval in accordance with Art. 120a (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act. This proposed system had been enhanced in fundamental respects. The Annual General Meeting approved the remuneration system with 84.6% of votes in favour. The current remuneration system and the resolution of the Annual General Meeting are published on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s website.\nThe Bank\u2019s shareholders may submit recommendations or other statements by letter or e-mail or may present them in person. Since the 2020 financial year, there has also been an orderly process regulated in the Engagement Policy for contacting Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as a shareholder. At the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Managing Directors or the Supervisory Board comment or reply directly. Shareholders may codetermine the course of the Annual General Meeting by submitting countermotions or supplementary motions to the agenda. Shareholders may also request an Extraordinary General Meeting be convened. The reports and documents required by law for the Annual General Meeting, including the Annual Report, as well as the agenda for the Annual General Meeting and any countermotions or supplementary motions may be downloaded from the internet.\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft informs the public \u2013 and consequently shareholders as well \u2013 about the Bank\u2019s financial position and financial performance four times a year. Corporate news that may affect the share price is also published in the form of ad hoc releases. This ensures that all shareholders are treated equally. The Board of Managing Directors reports on the annual financial statements and the quarterly results, as well as on the Bank\u2019s future strategy, at press conferences and events for analysts and investors.\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft uses the options offered by the internet for reporting purposes, providing a wealth of information about the Group at  In addition to the rules of procedure of the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board, the Articles of Association of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are also available online. The financial calendar for the current and the upcoming year is also published in the Annual Report and on the internet. It shows the dates of all the significant financial communications, notably the annual press conference and analyst conferences and the date of the Annual General Meeting.\nWe feel an obligation to communicate openly and transparently with our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We intend to continue meeting this obligation in the future.\nAbout this report\nThis combined non-financial report for Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Commerzbank Group1 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Act on Strengthening Corporate Non-Financial Reporting (CSR- Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz, CSR-RUG). Alongside the parent company, it covers in particular the material subsidiaries Commerz Real AG, mBank S.A. and Commerzbank Finance & Covered Bond S.A.\nAs required by law, we provide information in this report on environmental protection, treatment of employees, social responsibility, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery. As customer focus is another key factor in our success, we also report on the treatment of customers. To identify the topics to report on, we conducted a new materiality analysis of non-financial issues that are key to understanding the\n1 Unless stated otherwise, the information in this report relates to the Group.\nbusiness performance and situation of Commerzbank and that are significantly impacted by our business activities (see section \u201cKey topics analysed\u201d). The description of the business model can be found in the \u201cStructure and organisation\u201d section of the (Group) management report.\nThe directives stipulated by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft apply to the entire Group because it is defined as the \u201cglobal functional lead\u201d. If relevant arrangements at the subsidiaries differ from these policies, these arrangements are explained in this report. Commerzbank Finance & Covered Bond S.A., which as at the end of 2022 had just ten remaining employees and was exclusively managing a run-off portfolio, did not have any additional information to contribute on material non-financial issues in 2022.\nWe are not aware of any material risks resulting from the application of the net method either from the Bank\u2019s own business activities or in connection with business relations, products or services that would be highly likely to have a severe negative impact on the non-financial aspects, now or in the future. Further\nIn 2021, it became one of the first open-ended real estate funds to promote environmental and/or social objectives pursuant to Article 8 of the Disclosure Regulation. The fund has expanded its investment strategy accordingly. The aim is to reduce the portfolio\u2019s CO2 footprint to 14 kilogrammes per square meter by 2050. In August 2022, hausInvest decided to meet the requirement level for environmentally sustainable investments under the EU taxonomy and the minimum requirements for sustainable investments for the purposes of the EU Disclosure Regulation. The taxonomy states that their minimum share is 5% of the fair value of the real estate belonging to the special fund. In determining the fair value mentioned above, project developments are included from the time of their completion and properties held by real estate companies are included in proportion to their ownership interest.\nTrading or offsetting emissions\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is a participant in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS). It advises companies on the procurement of carbon emissions rights and on the associated risk management aspects, and helps to implement the resulting trading strategies. In addition, there is the option of voluntarily offsetting a company\u2019s unavoidable carbon emissions with certificates from emission reduction projects. As a member of the World Bank\u2019s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC), the Bank also participates in the global debate on carbon pricing.\nIn equipment leasing, Commerz Real has started to anchor sustainability in its business via its subsidiary Commerz Real Mobilienleasing (CRML). CRML\u2019s PRO Climate Lease also offers the option to support projects aimed at avoiding or absorbing CO2 emissions in parallel with the financing business.\nEnsuring data security\nThe protection of customer data and compliance with banking secrecy requirements are of the utmost importance in this era of increasing digitalisation. They are fundamental to the satisfaction of our customers and to trust within a long-term business relationship. That is why data security is a key issue for us in terms of responsible banking.\nResponding to cyber crime\nWith the increasing digital networking of state, business and society, cyber security and resilience are becoming more and more important. Commerzbank scrutinises not only its own information, premises and IT systems, but also those of its customers and service providers, including any independent transport routes.\nCyber security is a strong driver of customer confidence and thus an important competitive factor. As part of the critical infrastructure, the financial industry is subject to enhanced legal requirements.\nData security plays a key role in responsible banking\nWe want to adequately address both this trend and future challenges relating to the management of cyber risks. Cyber and information security risks are managed by the Group division Group Risk Management \u2013 Cyber Risk & Information Security (GRM-CRIS), which reports to the Group Chief Information Security Officer. In addition to established security functions such as the Information Security Management System, the focus is on managing cyber risk appropriately and on strengthening Commerzbank\u2019s cyber-resilience (including its information security incident management capabilities). To cover the human element, we also rely on our employees being highly security and risk-conscious. We promote this via a special, multi-award- winning information security awareness campaign. GRM-CRIS also addresses the interplay between cyber and information security risks and other types of risk relating to areas such as HR, procurement, BCM and physical security. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is a founding member of the German Competence Centre against Cybercrime (G4C) association, which collaborates with the Federal Criminal Police Office. The association\u2019s aim is to develop and optimise measures to counteract cyber crime in order to protect its members and their customers against damage.\nmBank also attaches great importance to the security of its IT systems and the data they contain, deploying suitable organisational and technical solutions. Every employee of mBank in Poland is required to complete cyber security training once a year. The bank\u2019s security department also includes a 24-hour security operations centre (SOC). Employees and customers can report all cyber security matters to the SOC, including identified incidents, attempted attacks and suspicious transactions. mBank also offers free support in the event of cyber incidents when customers have been victims of cyber crime.\nEnsuring data protection\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft takes the protection of personal data very seriously and complies with the applicable data protection rules, in particular the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the Group Data Protection Policy.\n \n60 \nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure a consistently high level of data protection in the Group and to respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects over the long term. It includes principles applicable Group-wide for the collection, processing, use and international transmission of personal data.\nMaking sparing, proportionate, necessary use of personal data only within the legally permissible limits is a right under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, to which Commerzbank is expressly committed. This also includes processing only for a specific purpose and ensuring transparency towards and the provision of information to the data subject. Commerzbank also transfers personal data to third parties only if this is lawful and it is not apparent that there is a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject; this includes transfers of personal data to authorities. Personal data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for business purposes and there is no other legitimate reason preventing deletion. We can demonstrate that we comply over time with the principles governing the processing of personal data.\nThe purpose of the data protection policy is to ensure a consistently high level of data protection and to respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of affected persons sustainably\nCommerzbank investigates inquiries, complaints, requests for information and breaches of personal data protection without delay and keeps in close communication with the data subject, especially when there may be risks to their fundamental rights and freedoms. In addition, data subjects can contact Commerzbank\u2019s data protection officer at any time. To raise our employees\u2019 awareness of data privacy and data security issues and keep them informed, there are regular training sessions and mandatory educational programmes.\nCommerzbank\u2019s data protection officer is responsible for data protection management for the comdirect brand. Commerz Real has a central data protection officer and data protection coordinators in the departments. In Poland, mBank\u2019s data protection officer and the associated team support the bank\u2019s business units, based on the Personal Data Security Policy and the Policy for Personal Data Management over Time.\nGiven that the Bank has almost 11 million customers in Germany and around 5.7 million in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, plus around 26,000 corporate customer associations, groups, financial service providers and institutional customers worldwide, the number of data protection complaints was again comparatively low in 2022.\nFor example, the data protection officer of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in Germany received 199 customer complaints in the year under review. In most cases, the complaint was that data had been put to unauthorised use or had become known to third parties.\nThe efficient and holistic processing of data offers great opportunities\nUsing big data responsibly\nThe use of big data and advanced analytics (BDAA) is of central strategic importance for Commerzbank. Efficient and holistic data processing offers great opportunities for all segments and Group divisions: as a basis for decision-making in the management of operational processes, for more detailed and faster analysis, and for improved service and cross-selling. In addition, BDAA provides methods for efficiently designing Group-wide models to calculate credit and operational risk as well as capital requirements, and to perform stress testing. This helps to ensure regulatory compliance and improve capital efficiency. To comply with the high data protection standards, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft works with pseudonymisation, anonymisation and micro-segmentation.\nMaintaining dialogue\nFor us, product transparency and fairness towards our customers mean providing holistic and comprehensible advice on financial products, their risks and possible alternatives in accordance with long-term needs. This also includes documenting the advisory process in transparent fashion. In recent years, we have introduced new products and services with particular customer benefits. These include a green ecosystem, green mortgage loans and the new \u201cmoney mate\u201d investment solution.\nAll units of the Group get their customers actively involved. Experts communicate with customers through various channels to ensure that their ideas and suggestions are taken into account when developing products and services. The Co\nmmerzbank Aktiengesellschaft UX Studio supports this process with insights into users\u2019 needs and expectations. UX stands for user experience, i.e. the customer\u2019s experience before, during and after their use of a product.\nThe table provides an organized overview of the contents of a sustainability report, structured into five main sections, each detailing different aspects of the company\u2019s sustainability efforts and how these efforts align with the concerns mandated by the CSR-RUG (Corporate Social Responsibility - Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz).\n\n1. **About This Report**:\n   - **Content**: Statutory requirements and background, introduction, relevant milestones in 2022, external assessment of sustainability performance.\n   - **Concerns in accordance with the CSR-RUG**: No specific CSR-RUG concerns mentioned for this section.\n\n2. **Anchoring Sustainability in Our Strategy**:\n   - **Content**: Establishment and management of sustainability, governance structures expanded, key issues analyzed, pursuing net zero target.\n   - **Concerns in accordance with the CSR-RUG**: Environmental protection and respect for human rights.\n\n3. **Responsible Management**:\n   - **Content**: Making stance clear, evaluating environmental and social criteria, reducing financed emissions, incorporating EU taxonomy, managing climate and biodiversity risks.\n   - **Concerns in accordance with the CSR-RUG**: Environmental protection and respect for human rights.\n\n4. **Supporting the Customer Transformation**:\n   - **Content**: Sustainable financing, sustainable investments and capital market products, ensuring data security, maintaining dialogue.\n   - **Concerns in accordance with the CSR-RUG**: Treatment of customers.\n\n5. **Leading by Example**:\n   - **Content**: Reducing operational emissions, embodying collegiality, promoting diversity and equal opportunity, ensuring integrity and compliance, working for the good of society.\n   - **Concerns in accordance with the CSR-RUG**: Environmental protection, social responsibility, treatment of employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption.\n\nThis table is designed to outline the main themes and initiatives detailed in the report, connecting these initiatives directly to broader CSR concerns, demonstrating the company\u2019s commitment to addressing important social and environmental issues through its operations and governance.\nIn UX research studies, customers, non-customers and employees are involved at an early stage in the entire development process and in live operations to ensure offerings are customer- focused.\nThe comdirect brand carries out activities to foster customer loyalty that are based in part on the \u201ccomdirect community\u201d, where customers and others with an interest in the financial markets can discuss products and other financial topics with the Bank.\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s Corporate Clients segment conducts regular customer surveys on specific topics in order to develop its range of products and services. This provides us with information on customer preferences and requirements, which can be used in the design of products and processes.\nThe involvement of our customers is a guiding principle for our actions\nIn addition, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft actively involves its customers through various customer advisory councils. In a central advisory council and ten regional advisory councils, selected figures from companies, institutions and public life have the opportunity to enter into direct dialogue with the Board of Managing Directors, find out about the performance of the business and contribute their experience and expectations.\nSurveying target groups\nSME topics are at the heart of Commerzbank\u2019s \u201cUnternehmer- perspektiven\u201d initiative (\u201cBusiness Owners\u2019 Views\u201d). Once a year it surveys owners and top-level managers from companies of different sizes and from different industries. In 2022, 300 companies were surveyed for a study entitled \u201cWirtschaft im Umbruch: nachhaltig und digital\u201d (\u201cEconomy in turmoil: sustainable and digital\u201d) about the status of their sustainability implementation in the face of the multiple crises that are currently occurring. In addition, the study provides answers to questions on how companies are dealing with data today and the role played by digital ethics in this. The results also show the opportunities associated with digitalisation, and which digital technologies are relevant for corporate customers today and going forward.\nIn the business owners\u2019 study, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft surveys 2,500 companies from across Germany with annual sales of up to !15m. They include freelancers, self- employed people, tradespeople, and small and medium-sized enterprises. Some are customers of Commerzbank, while others bank elsewhere. The 2022 study was on the topic of cyber security. The results show that the companies surveyed consider this to be a very important issue. Around two in five companies in Germany have already been the victim of a cyber attack, with\nnearly one in five affected companies suffering losses as a result of the attack. Nevertheless, the vast majority of companies feel they are well-positioned when it comes to cyber security.\nImproving advisory services\nWith the amendment of the MiFID II Directive as part of the EU Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, it became mandatory in August 2022 to ask about sustainability preferences when providing investment advisory and financial portfolio management services. Our investment advisory teams received intensive training on this topic. As part of the fact-finding stage, we educate customers about the three sustainability standards defined in the guideline and ask about their sustainability preferences. Where they have a sustainability preference, customers subsequently decide on the share of their investments to be put into sustainable assets. The advisory universe in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment comprises some 500 financial instruments that meet at least one of the sustainability standards defined by MiFID II.\nSome 500 financial instruments in the Private and Corporate Clients segment meet at least one of the sustainability standards defined by MiFID-2\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is building up a green ecosystem for sustainability-related issues that lie outside our core competencies. The Bank\u2019s expert cooperation partners provide support in the form of consulting services, for example determining a company\u2019s carbon footprint, developing a specific sustainability strategy, or identifying and managing climate risks. In this way, we have already been able to help many customers since the programme was launched at the start of 2022.\nTo make Commerzbank\u2019s products and services available to all interested parties, we also go to great lengths to ensure that our branches and online offering are fully accessible. Around two- thirds of our branches are accessible at ground level. We strive to ensure accessibility for all user groups where possible whenever we renovate a branch or install an ATM. For dispensing cash, all of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft\u2019s ATMs have a read-aloud function for visually impaired people. Further information on our efforts to be inclusive, including towards our employees, can be found under \u201cDriving inclusion\u201d.\nPrivate customers can use a CO2 calculator in the banking app to work out their personal carbon footprint based on a questionnaire about their mobility and consumption habits and living situation. This application is supplemented by information on sustainable lifestyles and sustainable product offerings from Commerzbank.\n  \n64 \nunderstanding of sustainability and to strengthen our expertise as contact partners for sustainability matters.\nWe are also shaping the increasingly digital working world within the Group through changes in work structures: mobile technical applications, agile working, and flexible workplaces and working hours are just a few of the keywords in this context. Commerz Real, for example, offers a model in which employees can choose between variable working hours and trust-based flexitime. It also attaches great importance to the ongoing training of its employees. Virtual formats such as the Sustainability Session and Digi Sessions are aplatform for cross-disciplinary presentation and discussion of topics such as sustainability and digitalisation in the real estate and renewable energy sectors and in equipment leasing. The \u201cLernzeit+\u201d (Learning Time+) model was added in 2022 and allows all employees to devote up to 12 hours of their working time per quarter to continuing education or training opportunities of their choice.\nHealth is the foundation for the Performance of an organization and its workforce alike\n \n68 \nIn 2022, a Human Rights Officer was appointed to assume the responsibilities arising from the LkSG. The Chief Compliance Officer performs this important and responsible role, in which capacity they report directly to the Chief Risk Officer. The Board of Managing Directors is also assisted by other units with a view to covering human rights standards as holistically as possible within Commerzbank.\nFighting corruption effectively\nIn our fight against corruption and bribery, we go further than simply focusing on statutory requirements such as the German Criminal Code, the UK Bribery Act or the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We also adhere to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the OECD\u2019s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and comply with the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. These external standards are supplemented with internal guidelines, which are reviewed at least annually and updated as needed: Commerzbank\u2019s Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (ABC Policy) actively seeks to combat bribery and other forms of corruption.\nWith our Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, we are actively combating bribery, the acceptance of benefits and other forms of corruption\nTo this end, we conduct regular training sessions for our employees so that they can implement our guidelines competently and consistently. A central element of this is the annual anti- corruption training for all employees.\nBusiness and functional units with heightened risk profiles and individuals who have an increased risk of bribery and corruption due to their functions at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft receive additional targeted training. A team with special training in this type of risk is available to provide advice to all employees. Commerzbank has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and other criminal acts by employees. Any employee who is proven to have breached this will face the full consequences under labour, civil and criminal law.\nKey figure: As in previous years, there were no known cases of corruption in the Commerzbank Group in 2022.\nWorking for the good of society\nWith regard to its\nsocial commitment,\nCommerzbank\nengages with its\nenvironment in a\nvariety of ways. Various projects and initiatives developed together with partners from business and society contribute to the good of society. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft also donated a total of !632,471 to various institutions and organisations in the year under review.\nThe war in Ukraine was a source of great concern at Commerzbank, among employees and customers alike. In order to help people on the ground quickly and unbureaucratically, Commerzbank undertook a major fundraising campaign. The Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank decided to provide !200,000 of emergency aid, which went to Caritas International and an aid campaign run by the city of Leipzig, which is twinned with Kyiv. Customers and employees also made substantial donations to these campaigns.\nOne example of our social and environmental engagement is the Commerzbank environmental internship launched with the German national parks back in 1990. Each year, it provides up to 75 students with practical experience in the areas of environmental education and public relations in the natural landscapes of the country\u2019s national parks. Commerzbank organises and finances the environmental internship programme, while the national parks provide the subject matter expertise. Since the programme began, more than 1,900students have participated and subsequently applied their experience to business, politics, society or environmental protection.\n\nCommerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is also involved in the \u201cFinanz- Heldinnen\u201d (\u201cfinancial heroines\u201d) initiative to get more women interested in finance. The initiative was set up in early 2018 by a group of female comdirect employees with the aim of making a positive contribution to society. To help women become better acquainted with the topic of finance and make independent financial decisions, the financial heroines convey their knowledge through avariety of formats including an online magazine, podcasts, afterwork events and an Instagram channel, as well as the bestselling \u201cManager Magazin\u201d book \u201cDer Finanzplaner f\u00fcr Frauen\u201d (\u201cFinancial planner for women\u201d).\nAs a corporate citizen, Commerz Real wants to make an active contribution to society in the communities in which it operates. The Little Home project is an example of how the company\u2019s core business can be combined with its social responsibility: at the annual Social Day in September 2022, some 200 employees worked with the Little Home association to build ten temporary houses for people with no fixed abode. These small wooden container-style homes are equipped with basic necessities and are provided to homeless people by the association as a first step back into society. Commerz Real financed a total of 25 Little Homes through this cooperation in 2022. Commerz Real is also continuing its existing work supporting disadvantaged children and promoting digital education.\nIn 2022, mBank was for the fifth time the exclusive bank partner and sponsor of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity Foundation (GOCC). Via its customers, mBank has raised a total of more than !19m (PLN 90m) for the initiatives supported by the GOCC Grand Finale over the last five years.\nThe war in Ukraine is a constant presence, especially in neighbouring Poland, with the two countries sharing more than just a 530km border. As a result, the people of Ukraine were the focus of mBank\u2019s social commitment in 2022. Among other actions, mBank joined the Polish Centre for International Aid (PCPM) fundraising campaign in March 2022, enabling customers to donate money to help people fleeing the war. mBank\u2019s customers gave almost !3m (PLN 13.8m) via the campaign in 2022. The PCPM uses these donations, among other things, to provide humanitarian aid to Ukrainians still in their home country or who have sought refuge in Poland.\nIn 2022, the people of Ukraine\nwere the focus of the Commerzbank Group\u2018s social commitment\nIn cooperation with PCPM, mBank has also set up an educational and creative centre for Ukrainian mothers and children in the mBank building in central Warsaw. The former office now offers dance classes, sports courses, art classes and book reading sessions for children. Children can also receive psychological and speech therapy there, while psychological support and careers counselling are also available for their mothers. Alongside the school, parts of the office building were converted into temporary accommodation for about 60 refugees between March and December 2022.\nIn April 2022, mBank introduced a personal account for Ukrainian citizens with an expedited account opening procedure. There is no charge for the account or the associated card. The bank also plans to set up a special hotline for these customers, staffed by Ukrainian-speaking specialists.\nFoundations for the future\nVarious foundations supported by the Group over the long term also make a significant contribution to society. As a corporate foundation, the Commerzbank Foundation promotes the social responsibility of its founding company to work towards a society fit for the future. Its motto is: participation creates the future. With its independent foundation, Commerzbank takes responsibility for its sustainable commitment to be a \u201cgood citizen\u201d of the community that goes beyond its actual business activities.\n  \n70 \nSince its establishment in 1970, the Commerzbank Foundation has built up many sustainable partnerships across Germany and has thus become a firmly established provider of support in the world of German foundations. In its more than 50-year history, it has provided a total of around !40m to support well over 1,000 projects relating to cultural, social and scientific activities. Its partnership network ranges from museums and theatres to non- profit social organisations and scientific institutions, from national lighthouse projects to exemplary local initiatives.\nThe Commerzbank Foundation puts its focus on culture, social issues and science\nThe funding always supports cultural education and mediation, social participation for disadvantaged people and incentives for young researchers. In addition, seven social foundations have been established to provide financial support to the Bank\u2019s employees and retirees in unforeseeable emergencies. The common aim of all the foundations is to make a long-term and sustainable contribution to the future viability of society. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft provided a total of !596,000 in\nfunding for these foundations in 2022, covering expenses such as staff, workstations, premises costs and other operating costs.\nCommerzbank supported these social foundations in 2022 with a total of !596,000\nThe mFoundation in Poland focuses on education and supports children, parents, teaching staff, students and young academics with several funding programmes. In 2022, this included programmes for schools and nursery schools and a competition for the best academic thesis in mathematics. mFoundation also published its fifth book \u2013 \u201cMaths in green\u201d \u2013 in 2022. The book combines mathematics with environmentalism. Young artists are another focal point of support. Through its \u201cM wie Malerei\u201d (\u201cP for Painting\u201d) fund, the bank buys paintings by up-and-coming Polish artists. These artworks are selected on behalf of mBank by a committee of highly regarded representatives of the art market and a representative of mBank. By the end of 2022, the collection consisted of nearly 100 works of art.\npolitics, academia and society. It met for the first time in Frankfurt am Main on 23May 2022. Going forward, the Sustainability Advisory Board is due to meet twice a year.\nOn 4July 2022, Commerzbank held a second public Sustainability Dialogue event to provide information on the progress it has made with its sustainability strategy. Commerzbank has defined concrete CO2 reduction targets for half of the loans it has granted. These are to be achieved by 2030. The Bank\u2019s efforts to manage climate risk are initially focused on CO2-intensive sectors. For example, we are seeking to achieve reduction targets of at least 73% by 2030 for the power generation sector, and at least 57% for the significantly larger retail mortgage financing portfolio. Achieving these targets is a key intermediate step for the Bank in its drive to reduce the CO2 emissions of its entire lending and investment portfolio to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Further information can be found in the combined separate non-financial report on page 42 ff.\nCommerzbank issues its third own green bond\nCommerzbank successfully issued a green bond with an issuance volume of !500m at the beginning of June 2022. Commerzbank will use the proceeds to finance renewable energy projects. Thanks to the progress made with renewable energy projects, a third own green bond has now been issued to follow those from 2018 and 2020. We have therefore responded to the still growing demand for sustainable investments and are giving our investors the opportunity to participate in the transformation of the real economy towards greater sustainability.\nCommerzbank allocated the non-preferred senior bond to loans for onshore and offshore wind projects and solar projects. The bond has a term of 5.25 years with a call date in September 2026 and a coupon of 3% per annum.\nCommerzbank is an established player in the market for sustainable and green bonds. For years, the bank has been supporting its customers in preparing sustainable bond issues and placing them in the international capital market.\nRealignment of the Main Incubator\nCommerzbank realigned its Main Incubator at the end of April 2022: the early-stage investor will in future focus not only on fintechs but also on start-ups specialising in sustainability, known as greentechs. To accompany the shift in strategy, the new brand \u201cneosfer\u201d was created.\nThere has been no change to the unit\u2019s business principles: it will continue to monitor trends, invest venture capital and make new applications work for the Bank.\nSREP capital requirements for Commerzbank unchanged for 2023\nThe ECB has left the bank-specific capital requirements for 2023 defined for the Commerzbank Group as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) unchanged compared with 2022. The additional capital adequacy requirement under Pillar 2 (P2R) remains at 2% of total capital, of which at least 1.125% must be covered by Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The SREP decision replaces the previous SREP decision with effect from 1 January 2023.\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement for Commerzbank at Group level remained unchanged at 9.44% of risk-weighted assets (MDA threshold) as at 30 September 2022, taking into account the requirements of the current SREP decision. It comprises the CET1 minimum of 4.5%, the P2R requirement of 1.125%, the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the DSIB capital buffer for other systemically important banks, which is unchanged at 1.25%, the countercyclical capital buffer, currently 0.04%, and an AT1 shortfall of 0.03%.\nCommerzbank expects the MDA threshold to rise to around 10.1% in the first quarter of 2023 due to the industry-wide increase in countercyclical capital buffers and the activation of the sectoral systemic risk buffer in Germany.\nA requirement to hold additional own funds for the risk of excessive leverage (Pillar 2 requirement for the risk of excessive leverage \u2013 P2RLR) has not been set for the Commerzbank Group.\nWith a CET1 ratio of 14.1% as at 31 December 2022, we are a comfortable distance from the MDA threshold and thus have sufficient scope for the planned distribution of 30% of consolidated profit after deduction of AT1 coupon payments.\nFurther strengthening of the compliance function\nIn 2022 the Bank continued its activities to further strengthen the compliance function. In addition to the structural changes, these also related to staff training and the successful recruitment of qualified compliance experts to work at head office and in foreign locations.\nTo further improve the management of compliance risks, the compliance function implemented various long-term measures in areas such as global financial crime and global markets compliance, further strengthening compliance both in Germany and abroad.\n116 \nThe regulatory environment also remains challenging with regard to compliance risks. The focus here remains on the issues of anti-money laundering (including the implementation of the new BaFin administrative practice and the requirements of international standard-setters such as the EBA) and sanctions. In addition, anti- bribery and corruption (including the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and market compliance (among other things new EU requirements in sustainable finance, US requirements and CFTC regulations) are putting further risk types into the regulatory focus.\nIn response to Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine in violation of international law, the G7 states have adopted a large number of comprehensive and, in some cases, new sanctions. However, some of these differ in detail from each other. Furthermore, sanctions generally come into force immediately after publication, and no prior consultation is planned. Due to these peculiarities in the sanctions regulation, one of the Bank\u2019s compliance functions focuses on supporting the Bank's operating units in adapting their processes to new regulatory requirements at short notice, so that the applicable sanctions regulations are fully complied with both in domestic and foreign business.\nSome of these cases could also have an impact on the reputation of Commerzbank and its subsidiaries. The Group recognises provisions for such proceedings if liabilities are likely to result from them and the amounts to which the Group is likely to be liable can be determined with sufficient accuracy. Since there are considerable uncertainties as to how such proceedings will develop, the possibility cannot be ruled out that some of the provisions recognised for them may prove to be inadequate once the courts\u2019 final rulings are known. As a result, substantial additional expense may be incurred. This is also true in the case of legal proceedings for which the Group did not consider it necessary to recognise provisions. The eventual outcome of some legal proceedings might have an impact on Commerzbank\u2019s results and cash flow in a given reporting period; in the worst case, it cannot be fully ruled out that the liabilities which might result from them may also have a significant impact on Commerzbank\u2019s earnings performance, assets and financial position.\nFurther information on legal proceedings may be found in Note 55 regarding provisions and Note 57 regarding contingent liabilities and lending commitments in the Group financial statements.\nCompliance risk\nCompliance risk falls within the definition of operational risk according to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Commerzbank acknowledges and understands the existence of inherent compliance risk in its areas of business, which are subject to the risk of abuse in general and in particular by financial crime. Compliance risk in this context comprises risks relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions/embargoes, markets compliance, fraud, bribery and corruption, as well as consideration of human rights and environmental risks in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG).\nIn order to actively promote a compliance culture in the Bank, the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank has laid down and communicated corresponding values in the Code of Conduct.\nOrganisation\nGroup Compliance is led by the Divisional Board member for Group Compliance, who reports directly to the Board of Managing Directors. Pursuant to Art. 87 (5) of the German Securities Trading\nAct (WpHG) and BT 1.1 MaComp (minimum requirements of the compliance function), the division head of Group Compliance is both the Group\u2019s Compliance Officer and, under Art. 25 h (7) of the German Banking Act (KWG) and Arts. 7 and 9 of the German Anti- Money Laundering Act (GwG), the Anti-Money Laundering Officer; this person is supervised as such by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\nThe Group Compliance division head also assumes the role as human rights officer according to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG). The human rights officer shall have a deputy human rights officer who shall have the rights and powers of the human rights officer.\nGroup Compliance is responsible for:\nA. The five types/areas of compliance risk:\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Bank decided to implement in Compliance the requirements set out in the LkSG.\nThe responsibilities based on the obligations under the QI (Qualified Intermediary), FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and CRS (Common Reporting Standard) regimes as well as in relation to the prevention of the aiding and abetting of tax evasion (Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation ! ATEF) have been bundled within the Group Tax function; the corresponding role of the QI and FATCA Responsible Officer was transferred to Group Tax in July 2022. In the foreign locations, the roles and responsibilities with regard to ATEF-related tasks under the overall responsibility of Group Tax remain unaffected by this structural change and will continue to be carried out there by the local compliance function.\n148 \nCyber risk\nCyber risk comprises risks with direct relevance to security and risks that lead to relevance to security (with respect to cyber space). The part of cyber space of relevance to Commerzbank is all connected IT environments within the Bank and those outside the Bank that lead to customers, business partners and service providers. Cyber risk is therefore concerned with the digital representation of the Bank\u2019s assets (data, information) within cyber space.\nThe strategic guidelines from the Group risk strategy and the cyber and information security strategy apply without limitation to cyber risk.\nCommerzbank manages cyber and information security risks via the Group division \u201cGroup Risk Management \u2013 Cyber Risk & Information Security\u201d (GRM-CRIS), which reports to the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). In addition to established security functions such as the ISO 27001 certified Information Security Management System (ISMS) as well as risk reporting on key risk indicators, GRM-CRIS focuses on managing cyber risk appropriately and on strengthening Commerzbank\u2019s cyber- resilience (including its information security incident management capabilities). It also addresses the interaction between cyber and information security risks and other types of material risk relating to areas such as operational risk.\nThe main factor in the current cyber risk situation is the geopolitical tension surrounding the Ukraine war. The actual threat situation has so far been limited to cross-sector attacks by pro- Russian and pro-Ukrainian activists. Cyber attacks and sabotage campaigns by state actors have thus far been focused on Ukraine. Developments in the cyber context are observed on an ongoing basis at Commerzbank by an interdisciplinary task force (top management and specialists from GRM-CRIS and Group Technology Foundations \u2013 GS-TF).\nIn connection with the increased remote use of Bank resources, for example in connection with split operations or working from home, there are still no new or expanded methods of attack against the Bank and its employees.\nIn the last two years the increasing spread of ransomware in cyber crime has to be emphasised, even if Commerzbank has not been affected by this so far. Ransomware is a special type of malware that blocks access to or encrypts data on IT devices and\nthen requires the victim to pay a ransom for its recovery. The significant damage potential of such attacks is illustrated by a number of recent incidents in which supply chains were disrupted. By closely interlinking the 1st and 2nd line of defence (LoD) activities in the field of cyber threat analysis, including corresponding protective measures and incident management processes, the Bank shall continue to be adequately protected against ransomware attacks.\nHuman resources risk\nHuman resources risk falls within the definition of operational risk referred to in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The internal, management-oriented interpretation of this definition at Commerzbank includes the following elements in human resources risk:\nAdjustment risk: Adjustment risk results when organisational and operational circumstances change (for example, restructuring, changes in management culture, qualification needs), these changes impact employees\u2019 scope of responsibilities and therefore require a greater willingness to change on the part of the staff. We offer selected internal and external training, continuing education and change programmes to ensure that the qualification levels of our employees keep pace with the current requirements, guidance is provided for structural changes and our employees can fulfil their duties and responsibilities.\nMotivation risk: Motivation risk arises when demotivating factors are not eliminated and employees do not adequately perceive motivating factors such as management or remuneration. The effects (such as withheld performance by employees) can have a direct impact on the working environment and the organisation\u2019s productivity. Employee surveys enable us to respond as quickly as possible to potential changes in our employees\u2019 level of corporate loyalty and to initiate adequate measures.\nDeparture risk: Departure risk takes into account the consequences of undesired employee departures (for example, if an employee resigns voluntarily), particularly when high performers are involved. We take great care to ensure that the absence or departure of employees does not result in long-term disruptions to our operations. We also monitor staff turnover on a regular basis from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

The current version of the declaration of compliance as well as earlier versions\nare published on the Internet at www.eon.com.\nIn early 2023 the Supervisory Board Chairman held discussions with investors on topics\nspecific to the Supervisory Board at a corporate governance roadshow.\nThe Supervisory Board is aware of no indications of conflicts of interest involving members\nof the Supervisory Board in the 2022 financial year.\nEducation and training sessions on selected issues of E.ON\u2019s business were conducted for\nSupervisory Board members in the 2022 financial year. The Supervisory Board was given a\npractical explanation of the effects of, and defense against, a cyberattack during a visit to\nthe Cyber Range. In addition, the Supervisory Board was informed about current trends in\ncorporate governance and their implications for E.ON. At another event, the main\ndevelopments and progress in the major digitalization projects at the network business\nwere presented. The Dutch customer solutions business was described in detail at a\nmeeting held in the Netherlands. Finally, the challenges arising from demographic\ndevelopments on the labor market were the subject of another event.\nThe targets for the Supervisory Board\u2019s composition, including a competency profile and a\ndiversity concept, with regard to Recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate\nGovernance Code and Section 289f, Paragraph 2, Item 6 of the German Commercial Code\nand the status of the implementation of the competency profile in the form of a\nqualifications matrix are available in the Corporate Governance Declaration.\nCommittee Work\n\nIn 2022 we continued to make eLearning courses available to all\nemployees and managers Group-wide. They are offered by a variety\nof departments. The curriculum\u2019s topics include compliance and\nanti-corruption as well as other legal areas such as data protection,\ncybersecurity, and human rights. Since 2010 all employees have\nhad to complete a Code of Conduct eLearning module on a regular\nbasis. Employees in units without internet access receive this\ntraining in written form and also at a face-to-face event.\nSince 2021, new employees must complete a new joiner eLearning\nmodule along with the module on the E.ON Code of Conduct. It\nfamiliarizes them with company rules and whom to contact if they\nhave questions or feel uncertain about a decision. In addition, new\n\n\u2192 InternalControlSystem \u2192 DisclosuresRegardingTakeovers\nGovernance\nCompliance and Anti-corruption\nGRI 2-23, GRI 2-26, GRI 3-3, GRI 205\nAn important objective for E.ON is to prevent, detect, and respond\nappropriately to any form of corporate misconduct. customers,\nbusiness partners, or other stakeholders should not be deceived,\nlied to, or otherwise deliberately harmed. We are committed to\nensuring that laws are strictly obeyed and that integrity and\ncompliance are systematically promoted as core components of\nour corporate culture. This is the only way for us to retain and\ndeepen our stakeholders\u2019 trust for the long term.\nNegligence or deliberate violations could lead to fines and criminal\nprosecution for the employees in question and could harm E.ON\u2019s\nreputation. Corruption is unacceptable for another reason as well:\nit leads to decisions being made for the wrong reasons. It can thus\nimpede progress and innovation, distort competition and do\nlasting damage to E.ON and its stakeholders.\nWe therefore take potential compliance violations very seriously.\nIf they are substantiated, we systematically pursue and punish\nthem. E.ON\u2019s approach to compliance and anti-corruption is\napplicable for all business units and Corporate Functions and\nextends to suppliers as well. Information on compliance notices\ncan be found in the \u201cProgress and Measures\u201d section below.\nE.ON\u2019s Approach\nE.ON is committed to combating corruption in all its\nmanifestations and supports national and international efforts\ndirected against it. The Company\u2019s participation in the United\nNations Global Compact underscores its rejection of any form of\ncorruption. The E.ON Management Board has the ultimate\nresponsibility for ensuring that E.ON conducts its business legally\nand at all times refrains from criminal practices in achieving its\nbusiness objectives. To ensure this for all business units, we have\nestablished a central compliance function. Its task is to support\n\u2192 ForecastReport \u2192 RisksandChancesReport\n\u2192 CorporateGovernanceDeclaration\nthe E.ON Management Board in its responsibility to prevent, detect,\nand eliminate corporate crime.\nE.ON has in place a compliance management system (\u201cCMS\u201d) to\nmitigate the risk of compliance violations. The CMS is based on a\nnumber of widely recognized practices, including measures to foster a\ncompliance culture and a commitment to compliance targets (see\n\u201cGoals and Performance Review\u201d). It also enables us to identify and\nanalyze compliance risks, design a risk-adequate compliance program,\nand expand our compliance organization.\nGuidelines and Policies\nBoth our Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code of Conduct (both of\nwhich are available in the languages of all countries in which we\noperate) focus on our guiding principle, \u201cDoing the right thing.\u201d They\nprovide easy-to-understand guidance for all areas that are relevant to\nE.ON. These include human rights, anti-corruption, fair competition,\nand compliant relationships with business partners. The E.ON Code of\nConduct also contains an integrity test that employees can use to\ncheck whether they are doing the right thing. All employees are\nobligated under their employment contract to act in accordance with\nthe Code of Conduct\u2019s rules. In addition, ten People Guidelines, which\napply to all business units, explain in detail how employees can be sure\nthat they are doing things right. Our Code of Conduct is widely\nrecognized by experts. In 2021, for example, it was awarded the\nhighest mark among all DAX companies by the quarterly magazine of\nBCM, a professional association for compliance managers in Germany.\nAn important People Guideline that supports the Code of Conduct\naddresses anti-corruption. It contains a decision-making scheme that\nuses the familiar green, amber, and red of traffic lights to indicate\nwhen accepting or granting offers or gifts is permissible, potentially\nproblematic, or forbidden. Gratuities (such as donations and\nsponsorships) above a certain threshold, which varies by national law,\nmust be approved by the local Compliance Officer. Particularly strict\nrequirements apply to invitations and gifts from public, elected, or\ngovernment officials and their representatives. The Code of Conduct\nclearly states E.ON\u2019s prohibition against company donations to political\n\nmanagers receive integrity training that helps them fulfil their\nfunction as role models in E.ON\u2019s compliance culture.\nE.ON also uses a variety of tools to identify the areas of activity\nwhere the risk for certain compliance breaches is particularly\nhigh. Such compliance risk assessments (\u201cCRAs\u201d) are conducted\non an ongoing basis. CRAs employ various methods, ranging from\nspreadsheet-style questionnaires to personal (and confidential, if\napplicable) discussions with executives and employees. Based on\nthe findings, Group Compliance determines whether specific\nmeasures need to be taken to amend and refine the CRAs in order\nto appropriately address any (new) potential risks identified.\nIn addition, Group Compliance continually engages in dialogue\nwith the compliance officers appointed by local units\u2019\nmanagement and monitors their work. If employees suspect\nmisconduct or a violation of laws or company policies, they are\ninstructed to report it. For this purpose, they may use\u2014if they\nprefer, anonymously\u2014internal reporting channels or an IT-based\nwhistle-blower hotline. The system is available Group-wide and\ncan be accessed via the E.ON homepage or by telephone. Not only\nE.ON employees, but also business partners, their employees, and\nother third parties can contact the hotline confidentially. Group\nCompliance forwards the information to the relevant department\nor unit.\nE.ON wants to ensure that its compliance standards are adhered\nto in its supply chain as well. We therefore subject potential\nsuppliers to a compliance check to assess whether they act in\naccordance with our values and principles. To ensure that they\nmeet our compliance standards, we also conduct a\nprequalification process to verify potential suppliers\u2019 identity and\nintegrity. This includes, for example, determining whether a\nsupplier appears in the media in connection with compliance\nissues such as corruption or on an official sanction and terrorism\nlists. In some cases, potential suppliers must also complete a\nquestionnaire, which E.ON evaluates carefully. Prequalification is\nmandatory for all new suppliers. The Human Rights and Supply\n\u2192 ForecastReport \u2192 RisksandChancesReport\n\u2192 CorporateGovernanceDeclaration\nChain Management chapter provides more information on the supplier\nonboarding process.\nOur Know Your Counterparty (\u201cKYC\u201d) principle also defines minimum\nrequirements for certain business partners and scenarios, other than\nsuppliers. The KYC check is an IT-supported workflow that helps us\nverify counterparties\u2019 integrity and avoid legal, regulatory, and\nreputational risks related to compliance issues such as corruption,\nmoney-laundering, tax evasion, violation of economic sanctions, and\nterrorism financing. It is covered in our Know Your Counterparty\nPeople Guideline.\nE.ON is a member of a variety of compliance organizations. One\nexample is the German Institute for Compliance (whose German\nacronym is DICO), where E.ON also serves as Vice Chairman of DICO\u2019s\nCriminal Law Working Group. DICO\u2019s mission is to promote the role of\ncompliance and the establishment of recognized compliance standards\nin corporate governance in Germany. The institute also serves as a\nnetworking platform for compliance experts in and outside Germany.\nIn keeping with strong belief that an effective CMS requires an\ninterdisciplinary approach and an understanding of decision making\nwithin organizations, in 2021 E.ON started a new DICO working group\ndevoted to behavioral compliance and ethics.\nWe conducted surveys and intervention studies in the Group in 2022.\nThey were part of an interdisciplinary project with the Max Weber\nInstitute for Sociology at Heidelberg University, the Max Planck\nInstitute for Human Development in Berlin, and its spinoff, Simply\nRational GmbH. One of the topics investigated is how altered situation\nassessments (interventions) can influence the acceptance and\nefficiency of preventive compliance measures. The findings will be\npresented and implemented in 2023.\nGoals and Performance Review\nWe continuously evaluate the CMS\u2019s effectiveness to ensure that E.ON\nis able to prevent, detect, and take appropriate remedial action against\nillegal or criminal conduct or other rules violations. The CMS's\neffectiveness is monitored by the E.ON Management Board, the\n Search Back\nworldwide to meet minimum standards in their environmental,\nsocial, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) performance, including in relation to\nhuman rights. E.ON procures goods and services almost entirely\nfrom countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (\u201cOECD\u201d). OECD members have shared guiding\nprinciples for human rights, fair work practices, environmental\nprotection, and anti-corruption. The lack of such shared principles\nat companies outside the OECD may increase the risk of practices\nor incidents that harm people and the environment. Business with\nsuch companies accounts for less than 6.5 percent of E.ON\u2019s\npurchase volume. E.ON assesses its suppliers\u2019 ESG performance\nprior to doing business with them and subject suppliers in higher-\nrisk countries or categories to greater scrutiny. In addition, E.ON\nstrives to comply with the legal requirements for transparency\nalong its supply chain, which in many countries are becoming\nincreasingly more demanding.\nE.ON\u2019s Approach\nE.ON takes its responsibilities seriously and is therefore committed\nto doing business in a compliant way, respecting human rights,\nprotecting the environment, and ensuring proper work conditions.\nE.ON expects that its suppliers are likewise to high ESG standards\nand have processes in place to ensure that they do. Engaging in\ndialogue with stakeholders and participating in industry initiatives\nhelp E.ON to pay particular attention to human rights issues. For\nexample, E.ON is a member of econsense, a network of Germany-\nbased multinational companies dedicated to promoting sustainable\nbusiness development and respect for human rights. E.ON also\nparticipates in a working group at the German Compliance Institute\nDICO focusing on the same objectives.\nE.ON launched a Group-wide human rights due diligence project in\nthe summer of 2022 to prepare the Company for the requirements\nof Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. The project was led\nby the Group\u2019s Sustainability department. All other affected\ndepartments\u2014such as Supply Chain, Human Resources (\u201cHR\u201d),\nCompliance, and Health, Safety, and Environment (\u201cHSE\u201d) \u2014are\nTo prevent human rights violations, E.ON aims to always adhere\nto external standards and for this purpose has its own policies and\nguidelines. E.ON\u2019s Code of Conduct (more information can be\nfound in the Compliance and Anti-corruption chapter) obliges all\nemployees to contribute to a non-discriminatory and safe work\nenvironment and to respect human rights. E.ON\u2019s Human Rights\nPolicy Statement was signed by all Management Board members\nand published on the E.ON website. The statement acknowledges\nthe International Bill of Human Rights and the Declaration on\nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International\nLabour Organisation (\u201cILO\u201d) of the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) and its\nfundamental conventions. It also refers to E.ON's own guidelines,\nsuch as the Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, a People\nGuideline provides guidance to employees so that they procure\ngoods and services in line with E.ON\u2019s ESG standards. The rules\nand regulations E.ON follows also include the European\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and the principles\nof the United Nations Global Compact (\u201cUNGC\u201d). E.ON has been a\nparticipant in the UNGC since 2005.\nThe E.ON Supply Chain Function Policy describes the mandate\nand organizational setup of the Supply Chain function. The\nfunction encompasses the management of procurement\nprocesses, activities, policies, tools, and supplier relationships for\nall units to which the policy applies. In addition, the Function\nPolicy (in conjunction with the Supply Chain Handbook) defines\nGroup-wide principles, processes, and responsibilities for non-fuel\nprocurement by the above-mentioned units. Excluded from this\nare the special cases on a specific list (for example energy and fuel\nprocurement, financial and real estate transactions, insurance,\nand taxes).\nThe standards for human rights, working conditions, environmental\nprotection, and compliant business practices that E.ON require its\nsuppliers to meet are defined in the Supplier Code of Conduct, which\nwas updated in 2020. It applies to all suppliers. The updated version\ncontains a more detailed description of requirements for corporate\nsocial responsibility (\u201cCSR\u201d), including information about how to\ncontact E.ON\u2019s whistle-blower hotline. E.ON\u2019s supplier on-boarding\nprocess includes self-registration, a formal agreement to adhere to the\nSupplier Code of Conduct, and a compliance check. Non-fuel suppliers\nthat are not subject to supplier onboarding must agree to E.ON\u2019s\nGeneral Terms and Conditions for Purchase Contracts, which are\nlegally binding. These oblige non-fuel suppliers, among other things, to\ncomply with the minimum standards of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\u203a In addition, E.ON has issued a Slavery and Human Trafficking\nStatement annually since 2017. It describes the steps E.ON takes to\nprevent and combat human rights violations along its supply chain.\nE.ON publishes it annually on the Sustainability Channel of E.ON\u2019s\ncorporate website and on its UK website. \u2039\nE.ON is committed to procuring the fuel for its biomass-fired assets\nresponsibly and sustainably. Suppliers of solid biomass must, like non-\nfuel suppliers, contractually agree to comply with our Supplier Code of\nConduct. Until March 2023, the E.ON Biomass Purchasing\nAmendment from 2010 defined our policies and procedures, which\ninclude risk assessments, supplier audits, and provisions for joint\nventures. Effective March 2023, we redefined the terms for the\npurchase of solid biomass for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions\n(\u201cEIS\u201d) business and thus replaced the former Biomass Purchasing\nAmendment. The purpose of the new rules is to ensure that all units\nact in accordance with applicable EU regulations and meet E.ON\u2019s\nsustainability standards when procuring and using solid biomass for\ntheir business activities. All biomass suppliers must pledge to respect\nhuman rights, safeguard the general living conditions of persons\naffected by biomass production, and protect biodiversity and the\nenvironment.\n\nA first step toward decarbonizing supply chains is to make the\ncurrent CO2 emissions of purchased goods and services more\ntransparent. E.ON therefore conducted a heatmap analysis of the\ngreenhouse gas emissions in its supply chains. E.ON used third-\nparty emissions factors and cost-based data to create a CO2\nheatmap that gives it a more accurate overview of the climate\nfootprint of its product and service categories. The Company\nintends to build on this in 2023 and derive additional measures for\nmore transparency. More information on our reduction efforts can\nbe found in the Climate Protection chapter.\nVarious regulatory requirements currently oblige companies to\nintegrate their human rights due diligence into their business and\nsupply chain. Examples include Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due\nDiligence Act, which came into force on January 1, 2023, as well as\nthe EU taxonomy and the European Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive (\u201cCSRD\u201d). The latter will apply for the first time\nto reporting for the 2024 financial year. E.ON prepared for these\nrequirements by launching a Group-wide human rights due\ndiligence project in the summer of 2022. The Sustainability\nDepartment is responsible for the project; it works closely with\nLegal, Supply Chain, Group Accounting, HSE, and HR, and is\nsupported by outside experts. In addition, the Sustainability Council\nserves as a steering committee. Since the summer of 2022, E.ON\nhas examined the status quo of existing processes and measures,\nidentified gaps, and developed optimization measures. A concept\nfor conducting a risk analysis was adopted and will be implemented\nat E.ON\u2019s operations in 2023. E.ON identified the potential for\nminor improvements in matters relating to its supply chain, such as\nin the Supplier Code of Conduct and its approach to supplier risk\nmanagement, which will likewise be updated in 2023.\nE.ON continually improves its eLearning tools for employees, such\nas the annual web training module on human rights, compliance,\nand cyber and data security, which was updated in September\n \n\u2192 InternalControlSystem \u2192 DisclosuresRegardingTakeovers\n\u2192 ForecastReport \u2192 RisksandChancesReport\n\u2192 CorporateGovernanceDeclaration\npercent of non-fuel purchase orders and call-off contracts had\ncompleted the onboarding process. New suppliers are asked by\nthe manager responsible for their product or service category to\nregister using the supplier onboarding solution. Depending on the\ntransaction volume and HSE risk, suppliers must complete one or\nmore questionnaires. In certain cases, E.ON may take additional\nsteps. These include a supplier audit to check whether the\nsupplier complies with E.ON\u2019s standards for human rights,\nworking conditions, and environmental protection. E.ON may also\nrequire a supplier to have in place an environmental management\nsystem certified to ISO 14001 or Eco-Management and Audit\nScheme (\u201cEMAS\u201d) III or ISO 45001. Suppliers that participate in\ntenders as part of a public procurement act do not use the above-\ndescribed process but instead follow the qualification procedures\nrequired under their country\u2019s laws.\nBuilding on the assessment procedures introduced in 2018, in the\nyear under review E.ON continued to evaluate its suppliers\u2019\nperformance and, based on the findings, make decisions about its\nrelationship with them. In addition, E.ON determines annually\nwhich of its non-fuel suppliers it deems important; for this\npurpose, E.ON evaluates them on the basis of five KPIs: quality,\ncommercial aspects, delivery, innovation, and corporate\nsustainability, including human rights. E.ON discusses the results\nwith its suppliers in feedback meetings. During this meeting, E.ON\nalso decides whether E.ON will require a supplier to take specific\nimprovement measures if the business relationship is to be\nmaintained. Due to the crisis situation, E.ON held many additional\ndiscussions with suppliers that were not considered discussions\nof their performance.\nE.ON also made intranet-based training videos available to\nemployees. The videos highlight the tangible positive impacts of a\nmore sustainable supply chain and corresponding individual\npurchasing decisions. In addition, E.ON held three information\nevents called Lunch & Learn, which focused on the environment,\ndiversity, and occupational health and safety. Furthermore, six\nHSE events were held with suppliers in 2022, in part online due to\nthe pandemic.\nA large proportion of our biomass capacity is installed in Sweden.\nE.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB operates district heating businesses\nin \u00d6rebro, N\u00f6rrk\u00f6ping, and parts of Stockholm and Malm\u00f6. Since\n2014, E.ON has assessed the CSR performance of its suppliers\nthere using a method developed by E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB.\nIn addition, key requirements for biomass suppliers\u2014such as the\nSupplier Code of Conduct and compliance with the EU Renewable\nEnergy Directive II (\"RED II\")\u2014have been integral to contracts with\nsuppliers since 2021. In 2022 E.ON introduced an expanded in-\nhouse assessment of sustainability-related risks.\nGoals and Performance Review\n\nThe SVP Group Tax defines E.ON\u2019s tax principles and is responsible\nfor ensuring that these principles and concomitant procedures are\nin place, maintained, and complied with Group-wide. He reports to\nthe E.ON Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee on tax-\nrelated issues and risks. In addition, financial tax risks are reported\nto Group Controlling and Risk, which examines these risks from a\nGroup perspective and prepares reports for the consolidated risk\nassessment of the E.ON Group. The tax function disseminates\nguidelines and policies to ensure tax compliance, including related\ntasks, processes, and responsibilities. E.ON has in place tax\ncompliance management systems according to IDW audit\nstandard PS 980 at its major operations in Germany. The systems\u2019\npurpose is to identify and classify all material tax risks and to map\nthe findings in a detailed risk control matrix (\u201cRCM\u201d).

For this reason, they have a group-wide organizational structure that follows the Compliance Function Policy. \n- The Chief Compliance Officer (\"CCO\"), Global Head of Compliance & Data Protection, Group Compliance team, and business unit compliance officers comprise this group. \n- The CCO briefs the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee and E.ON Management Board weekly on CMS performance and recent developments.\n- The Management Board and Audit and Risk Committee are alerted immediately of major incidents. Company fraud is investigated by Group Audit, the internal audit section. The core Group Compliance branch handles Company fraud. An independent investigation can be done with internal audit aid. In 2022, we offered managers and personnel across the organization online learning classes. Human rights, cybersecurity, data protection, compliance, and anti-corruption are taught. \n- Since 2010, all employees must regularly complete a Code of Conduct eLearning lesson. No definition of regular exists. In departments without internet access, workers receive this training in person and in print. Since 2021, new hires must complete the E.ON Code of Conduct training and a new joiner eLearning module. In summary the company meets the G1-3 regulation fully."}]}

Furthermore, we strictly comply with the legal regulations for clinical and chemical-pharmaceutical research and de- velopment.\nWith IV drugs, it is also crucial that new products are continually brought to the market in a timely manner. Therefore, we monitor the development of new products on the basis of detailed project plans and focus on achieving specific milestones. In this way, we can take countermeas- ures if defined targets are called into question.\nBoth Fresenius Medical Care and Fresenius Kabi are exposed to typical patent-related risks. These include insuf- ficient protection by patents of the technologies and prod- ucts we develop, which could enable competitors to copy our products without having to bear comparable develop- ment costs.\nRISKS IN RELATION TO INCREASING RE\udbff\udc02ULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS\nThe increasing sustainability requirements of governments, investors and customers, as well as in the context of financ- ing transactions, could lead to additional costs. The grow- ing requirements and due diligence obligations in the regu- latory environment, as well as the voluntary commitment to our own sustainability and climate protection targets, could lead to additional liability risks. Furthermore, business in- volvement in areas that are the focus of social debate on sustainability can be perceived negatively and trigger nega- tive media attention. This could lead to reputational dam- age and impact the achievement of our business objectives. Since 2017, we have been conducting a comprehensive analysis to identify material issues for Fresenius with\nregard to any environmental and social risks as well as re- lated human rights and reputational risks.\nRISKS FROM ACQUISITIONS\nThe acquisition and integration of companies carries risks that can adversely affect the business, financial position, and operational result of Fresenius. Acquisition processes often include closing conditions, including but not limited to antitrust clearance, fulfillment of assurances and warran- ties, and adherence to laws and regulations. Non-compli- ance with such closing conditions by either party to an ac- quisition could lead to litigation between the parties or with others and thus claims against Fresenius.\nFollowing an acquisition, the acquired company\u2019s struc- ture must be integrated while clarifying legal questions and contractual obligations. Marketing, patient services, and lo- gistics must also be unified. During the integration phase, there is the risk that key managers will leave the company and that both the course of ongoing business processes and relationships with customers and employees will be harmed. In addition, change-of-control clauses may be claimed. The integration process may prove more difficult or require more time and resources than expected. Risks can arise from the operations of the newly acquired com- pany that Fresenius regarded as insignificant or was una- ware of. An acquisition may also prove to be less beneficial than initially expected. Future acquisitions may be a strain on the finances and management of our business. Moreo- ver, as a consequence of an acquisition, Fresenius may be- come directly or indirectly liable towards third parties, or claims against third parties may turn out to be non-assertable.\nWe counter risks from acquisitions by means of structured, detailed due diligence prior to deciding to go ahead with the acquisition and by means of detailed integration plans, as well as with a dedicated integration and project manage- ment process afterward so that countermeasures can be in- itiated in good time if there are deviations from the ex- pected development.\nCOMPLIANCE AND LEGAL RISKS\nCompliance Risks\nFresenius is subject to comprehensive government regula- tion and control in nearly all countries. In addition, Fresenius must comply with general rules of law, which dif- fer from country to country. There could be far-reaching le- gal repercussions or reputation damage should Fresenius fail to comply with these laws or regulations.\nWe must comply in particular with rules and regulations that monitor the safety and effectiveness of our medical products and services. Corruption is a core risk area across all business segments. Antitrust law, data protection, money laundering, sanctions, and the upholding of human rights are further significant risk areas. It is therefore of particular importance to us that our compliance programs and guidelines are strictly adhered to. Through compli- ance, we aim to meet our own expectations and those of our partners, and to orient our business activities to gener- ally accepted standards and local laws and regulations.\nAt Fresenius, risk-oriented compliance management systems are implemented in each business segment. These systems take into account the markets in which the respec- tive business segment operates and are tailored to the spe- cific requirements of the business segment. Furthermore, we at Fresenius assess compliance risks using a standard- ized methodology.\n99\n Fresenius Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents Strategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities | Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\nSEPARATE GROUP NON-FINANCIAL REPORT.\nWe are committed to being a socially and environ- mentally responsible corporate player in the global healthcare market. We have the ambition to shape future healthcare and build a sound base for sus- tainable growth.\nSTRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT\nAs a healthcare Group with more than 300,000 employees, Fresenius plays an important role in society. For more than 100 years, our mission has been to preserve life, promote health, and improve patients\u2019 quality of life. The importance of modern and functional healthcare for society again became particularly clear in 2022. Our employees worldwide have continued to work tirelessly and under sometimes\ndifficult pandemic conditions \u2013 in clinics, dialysis centers, factories, and logistics. In acute care, we have reduced the number of intensive care beds and ventilation stations to the pre-pandemic level. The dialysis centers also continued to provide safe treatments, even for kidney patients infected with COVID-19. We have consistently ensured the supply of our vital medicines, medical devices, and services for criti- cally and chronically ill patients.\nFor Fresenius, economic success is not an end in itself, but a means of continuously contributing to medical prog- ress. The patient\u2019s well-being always comes first. It is our point of reference for all business decisions. The common\ngoal of all business segments is to improve healthcare quality and efficiency. We aim to provide innovative solutions and work proactively to enable a growing number of people to have access to high-quality, affordable medicine.\nIn our Code of Conduct, we commit to integrity in dealing with our business associates as well as to socially responsible behavior and transparent communication. The Fresenius Code of Conduct defines basic principles that apply to all employees and the management of the Fresenius Group. It also sets out the framework for the relevant regulations of the individual business segments, and defines\n102\n    Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nour respective activity areas. Further information can be found in the Compliance and integrity chapter on pages 180 ff.\n\u25b6 We take responsibility for our patients\u2019 well-being and are committed to the highest quality in our products, treatments, and services.\n\u25b6 We want to do the right thing and comply with all applicable rules and laws. In addition to legal require- ments, we adhere to high ethical standards and rules of good corporate governance.\n\u25b6 We largely owe our success and growth to the commit- ment of our more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Our aim is therefore to be perceived as an attractiv employer to acquire talent, retain employees, and allow them to further develop their skills.\n\u25b6 We think and act long-term in our business decisions. We protect nature as the basis of life and treat resources with care.\n\u25b6 We are committed to respecting human rights as defined by international standards, such as the Declara- tion of Human Rights of the United Nations.\nWe analyze the impact of our actions with the help of the United Nations\u2019 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A particular focus is on the goals of good health and well- being (SDG 3), high-quality education (SDG 4), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). We also align our sus-\ntainable actions closely to the United Nations Global Com- pact and the sustainability requirements of the capital market. Further information is available on our website.\nTHE BUSINESS MODEL\nFresenius is a global healthcare Group and one of the lead- ers in its respective markets. The Fresenius Group com- prises four independently operating business segments managed by Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA: Fresenius Medical Care is the world\u2019s leading provider of products and ser- vices for individuals with renal diseases based on publicly reported revenue and the number of patients. Fresenius Kabi provides lifesaving medicines, medical devices, and services for the critically and chronically ill. Fresenius Helios is Europe\u2019s largest private hospital chain, with clinics in Germany, Spain, and Latin America. Fresenius Vamed specializes in healthcare facilities projects and service business. The Corporate segment comprises the holding functions of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA as well\nas Fresenius Digital Technology GmbH, which provides services in the field of information technology. The Group Management Report contains on pages 26 ff. additional information on the Group\u2019s business model and ownership structures, on legal and economic factors, as well as key sales markets and competitive positions.\nOUR VALUE CHAIN\nFresenius has an international distribution network and operates more than 90 production facilities. The largest of these are located in the United States, China, Japan, Ger- many, and Sweden. In the Fresenius Group, all purchasing processes are controlled by central coordination points\nin the business segments. Competence teams bundle the needs, conclude framework contracts, and continuously monitor current market and price trends. They also coordi- nate global procurement for individual production sites or clinics and initiate quality and safety controls for raw materi- als and procurement goods. Supply reliability and quality of care play an important role in an environment character- ized by ongoing cost-saving efforts by healthcare providers and by price pressure in the markets. We therefore constantly optimize our purchasing processes, standardize procure- ment materials, identify new sources of supply, and negotiate the best possible price deals. Maintaining high flexibility while meeting our strict quality and safety standards is cru- cial. A broad portfolio of suppliers reduces potential pro- curement or raw material shortages in both the product and service business. Additional information is included in the Procurement section of the Group Management Report on page 48.\nSUSTAINABILITY RISKS\nThe identification and assessment of potential sustainability risks (non-financial risks) initially takes place at both the Group level and in the four business segments via the exist- ing risk management system. Sustainability risks are cov- ered by the existing risk catalogs and risk reporting of the\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities | Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n103\n  Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nFresenius Group. In the fiscal year 2022, sustainability risks were recorded and assessed in a harmonized approach with the financial, legal, and compliance risks across the Group in the risk management system. At least quarterly, potential sustainability risks are evaluated at Group level by the cor- porate functions Risk Management & Internal Control System, Business Integrity, and Investor Relations & Sustainability of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, and supplemented if necessary.\nIn 2022, Fresenius Medical Care mandated an indepen- dent external tax auditor to review the Tax Compliance Management System (Tax CMS) in Germany based on an auditing standard (IDW PS 980) and OECD standards. The audit report confirmed that the company appropriately mitigates tax-related risks.\nIn the reporting period, we reviewed potential sustain- ability risks in the areas of climate change and water scarcity based on the analysis from the 2021 reporting year. We did not identify any material risks to our business model in the past fiscal year in either area. Additional information can be found in the Environment chapter starting on page 200. Our human rights risk assessment is explained on page 195. Overall, in the reporting period, we did not identify any material non-financial risks, taking into account risk mitigating measures (net risk assessment), related to our own business activities, business relationships, products, or services that are very likely to have an adverse effect on the\nnon-financial aspects mentioned above or on our business operations. The Group Management Report contains further information on opportunities and risks as well as a detailed presentation of risk management on pages 85 ff.\nDue to the international nature of the Group and the broad spectrum of security-related tasks, the Group function Corporate Business Continuity is continuously being developed and assigned additional activities. Today, the func- tion is responsible for corporate security, fire protection, corporate crisis management and travel security worldwide. In addition, those responsible deal with issues relating to maintaining or restarting business operations in or after crisis situations and also provide support in an operational context where necessary. Further information on business continuity is provided in the relevant chapters regarding the business segments.\nOUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS\nAND PROGRAMS\nWe pursue specific sustainability approaches at the level of the four business segments and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA. The business segments build their own sustainability pro- grams within the framework provided by the Group Sus- tainability Management and regularly review how they can further develop and optimize them.\nIn May 2021, the Fresenius Annual General Meeting approved a new compensation system for the members of the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE. In the context of short-term variable compensation, ESG (Environ- mental, Social, and Governance) targets have an influence on compensation in this system, with a weighting of 15%.\nThe focus of the ESG targets is on the key sustainability topics identified by Fresenius in the materiality analysis: qual-\nity / patient well-being, innovation and digital transformation, employees and diversity, environment, and compliance and integrity. With the identification of key performance indica- tors (KPIs) and the definition of comprehensive management concepts, the company will create a basis to make the sus- tainability performance of the business segments measur- able. The identified KPIs are intended to facilitate target set- ting and measurement in the long term and a selection of these also to be incorporated into the variable compensation of the company\u2019s executives. From 2023, quantitative ESG KPIs will be included in the short-term incentive (STI) of the Management Board, covering the key sustainability topics of medical quality / patient satisfaction, and employees. For the long-term incentive (LTI), the integration of a reduc- tion target for CO2e emissions is planned.\nIn the reporting year, the members of the Executive Board achieved the ESG targets. A detailed presentation can be found in the Compensation Report starting on page 243 of the Annual Report 2022. The ESG methodology for deter- mining target achievement is available on the website of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA.\nFor Fresenius Medical Care, the success of global sustainability efforts depends on cooperation between all regions and global functions, and the exchange of best practices. The business segment strives to leverage scale\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities | Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n104\n  Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nand expertise and takes regional needs into account in its activities. In 2022, Fresenius Medical Care established 10 new global policies and other standards, for example in the areas of diversity, employee engagement, and data protec- tion. It also defined new global performance indicators\nfor various areas of the sustainability program, including a quality index for patient treatments. The success of the Global Sustainability Program was measured using a con- trol and calculation model that evaluates more than 50 aspects. Throughout the duration of the program, progress was linked with Fresenius Medical Care\u2019s Management Board compensation via a sustainability target.\nBased on the results of the Global Sustainability Pro- gram, in 2022, the business segment developed a new set of global targets for the coming years. The Supervisory Board also decided on new sustainability goals for Manage- ment Board compensation in 2023. They are linked to prog- ress of Fresenius Medical Care's sustainability targets in the areas of patient satisfaction, employee satisfaction,\nand sustainable products and services.\nThe image depicts the organizational structure of the Fresenius Group's sustainability organization, illustrating how various governance bodies within the company are structured and interact with each other regarding sustainability initiatives. The diagram is organized horizontally and includes three main levels of governance:\n\n1. **Group Sustainability Board (GSB)**:\n   - Chaired by the CEO, this board appears to play a central role in defining and overseeing the group's sustainability strategy. It is likely responsible for high-level decisions and policies regarding sustainability across the company.\n\n2. **Group Management Board**:\n   - Also led by the CEO, this board oversees the overall management and operational control of the group. It includes a specific function or sub-department titled \"Investor Relations & Sustainability,\" which coordinates and supports sustainability officers across the company. This suggests a focus on integrating sustainability with broader business objectives and communicating these efforts to investors and external stakeholders.\n\n3. **Supervisory Board**:\n   - Supported by an external audit firm, this board is likely responsible for the oversight and audit of sustainability practices, ensuring compliance and effectiveness of the sustainability strategy implemented by the management boards. It is responsible for the audit and reporting components, ensuring accountability and transparency in the company's sustainability endeavors.\n\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nCapex\nThe amounts used to calculate the Capex KPI (denominator) are based on the capital expenditures reported in the con- solidated financial statements resulting from additions in the fiscal year to property, plant and equipment (IAS 16) and other intangible assets (IAS 38) excluding goodwill. In addition, the EU Taxonomy KPI takes into account right-of- use assets (IFRS 16). That also includes the additions from business combinations. This information can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 332, 334 and 363.\nFor the identification of the EU Taxonomy-eligible share (numerator), the Capex projects of the business segments were examined in more detail on the basis of this definition. This was done by allocating the value-based components to the relevant economic activities from Annex I, essentially the construction of new buildings (7.1), the renovation of buildings (7.2) and, for leasing projects, the acquisition of buildings (7.7). After analyzing the Capex definitions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, we determined only the Capex associated with the purchase of products and services from\na Taxonomy-eligible economic activity as applicable.\nThe EU Taxonomy-eligible Capex share 2022 (36.7%) relates to investments of all business segments in new construction and renovation of buildings, such as clinics or production facilities. In 2021, the share was 49%. The decrease in the reporting year is mainly due to two acquisitions of Fresenius Kabi, which disproportionately increase the Capex KPI (denominator). Of the total amount \u20ac1,290 million in 2022, \u20ac202 million are related to the economic activity construc- tion of new buildings (7.1) and \u20ac265 million to renovation of buildings (7.2), consisting entirely of additions to build- ings and additions to assets under construction, and \u20ac823 million to right-of-use assets (IFRS 16) and acquisition of buildings (7.7), of which \u20ac63 million resulted from business combinations. These EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activi- ties do not currently meet the substantial contribution criteria and are therefore not EU Taxonomy-aligned. For the report- ing year 2022, no further economic activities are applicable, that make a material contribution of at least 1% to the Capex KPI (denominator).\nOpex\nThe amounts used to calculate the Opex KPI (denominator) are based on the direct costs of research and development reported in the consolidated financial statements (Notes, page 325) and the costs of short-term leases (Notes, page 363). In addition, the cost of maintenance and repair including repair materials, were queried from the local Enterprise-Resource-Planning (ERP) systems for all business segments. For the identification of EU taxonomy-eligible shares (numerators), the above line items were matched with the descriptions of economic activities from Annex I. After analyzing the Opex definitions of the EU Taxonomy Regula- tion, we determined only the portion of operating expenses related to the purchase of products and services from a tax- onomy-eligible economic activity to be applicable. As part\nof the analysis, we have not identified any material EU Tax- onomy-eligible components that are directly attributable\nto relevant economic activities as defined by the EU Taxon- omy. The main expenditures for the maintenance of our building infrastructure are capitalized and are thus reflected in the EU Taxonomy-eligible Capex share.\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities | Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n\nStrategy and management Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities | Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\nWithin the Fresenius Group Management Board, the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of the business segments are responsible for operational management. The responsibility for quality management and quality assurance is regulated by the respective Management Board committees or man- agements, e. g. via a business allocation plan. The business allocation plan of the Fresenius Group Management Board does not provide for a separate department for this purpose. As part of risk reporting, the Fresenius Group Management Board is informed quarterly about the effectiveness of the quality management systems, i.e. about risks or incidents that could have a significant impact on the operating busi- ness, the reputation or the value chain of the Group and its business segments. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed of these developments on a quarterly basis, the Supervisory Board on an annual basis. For further information, please refer to page 86 in the Risk Report and page 180 f. in the Group Non-Financial Report, section Compliance.\n\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nIn the business segments, employees must ensure that the applicable quality and safety regulations are always applied in their areas of responsibility. The employees in the pro- duction facilities, outpatient centers, and hospitals have a special obligation to exercise due care. The organizational structures are adapted to the requirements of the individual business segments.\nIn the area of quality management, we monitor, manage, and improve processes with performance indicators. Our quality management systems meet and are based on various standards or are adapted to them, because the requirements differ for healthcare facilities and for the development, pro- duction and distribution of pharmaceuticals or even medi- cal-technical products.\nWe use different applications, such as externally provided IT systems or self-developed applications, to support our quality management systems. All locations are subject to regular, e. g. annual, external and internal audits. Addi- tionally, we carry out peer reviews in our hospitals, if the internal quality targets of a hospital are not met. This is done whenever the evaluation of the quality indicators reveals deviations from the internal targets. The results of these audits or peer reviews for each business segment are pre- sented in the evaluation sections of this chapter.\nTraining courses for our employees, which are an essential part of guaranteeing the safety of our patients and products, are an important component of our quality management systems.\nFurther information on employee training can be found in the Employee development section on pages 155 ff.\nPolicies and regulations\nThe business segments comply with the applicable laws within the framework of quality management. Internationally applicable frameworks are particularly important for product quality at our production sites and distribution centers and subsequently also for product safety. In our clinics and healthcare facilities, we apply internationally recognized standards from the hospital sector, local- regulatory requirements and laws for the outpatient and inpatient care of patients, e. g. the Fifth Book of the Social Code (SGB V) in Germany, which regulates basic require- ments for quality assurance. We measure the quality of patient care as well as the patient satisfaction with various indicators.\nDepending on the business area and market, we are subject to further specific regulatory requirements and stan- dards. This includes legislation on the Registration, Evalua- tion, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),\nthe Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), among other standards. In addition, we have to adhere to regulations that specify products used in patient treatments, e. g. product safety pro- visions with regard to hazardous materials in single-use products in hospitals.\nIn addition, the business segments apply their own comprehensive guidelines, which serve as internal orienta- tion, and which contain concrete instructions for specific processes.\nThe specific approaches and various measures imple- mented to meet the high requirements for patient and prod- uct safety are described on pages 113 ff.\nCertifications and commitment\nOur commitment to patients\u2019 health and well-being in the business segments is reviewed and certified by external partners or regulatory bodies. We are continuously expand- ing the number of sites certified to ISO 9001 standard, applicable international acknowledged care or hospital stan- dards, or quality standards provided for centers of exp- ertise for certain areas of treatment. Not all locations have the same scope of certifications 1. However, at the very least they adhere to internal quality standards, which consider the applicable regulatory provisions.\n1Coverage at business segment level depends on applicable standards or regulation..\n111\nStrategy and management Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities | Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nFresenius Medical Care\u2019s commitment to continuously improve the quality of care is included in their Code of Eth- ics and Business Conduct. The Global Patient Care Policy outlines the principles, responsibilities, and processes in connection with medical strategy and quality management, patient experience surveys and patient grievance mecha- nisms. Responsibility for integrating the policy into the business operations lies with senior medical leadership and the interdisciplinary patient care teams across the globe.\nWhen it comes to the safety and quality of products and services, the business segment is guided by its Global Quality Policy. This policy also covers the obligation to com- ply with relevant regulations and maintain environmentally sound and efficient operations. It is the basis for regional quality manuals and further policies covering respon- sibilities, training, risk assessments, and audits. Product safety and quality are overseen by the newly established Care Enablement segment, which was implemented on January 1, 2023. The Management Board is regularly infor- med about the global quality and safety performance.\nOver the past few years, Fresenius Medical Care has merged the quality management systems in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, as well as in Latin America, and Asia- Pacific.\nFresenius Medical Care continually measures and assesses the quality of the care provided in its dialysis clinics based on internationally recognized quality standards. These include those of the global nonprofit Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative, the U.S. National Kidney Foundation\u2019s Disease Outcomes Quality Ini- tiative (KDOQI), and the European Renal Best Practice guidelines. The business segment also considers indus- try-specific clinical benchmarks and its own quality targets.\n\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nSurveillance and reporting systems\nPost-market surveillance, or the act of monitoring the prod- ucts that have been released to the market, is an integral part of quality management. It is essential that products and services are effective and reliable, and that they pose as little a risk as possible to patients. Standards for planning, conducting, and monitoring clinical studies help enhance the product quality and safety of products. Should any issue arise concerning the safety of our products, Fresenius Medical Care takes corrective action. This could include pub- lishing further information and data on the product after market introduction, or recalling the product.Fresenius Medical Care strives to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in monitoring the adverse effects of drugs \u2013 also called pharmacovigilance \u2013 and medical devices. The business segment collects and reviews information relating to adverse events and product complaints.\nIn addition to experience surveys, Fresenius Medical Care offers further feedback channels. Patients and their representatives can report grievances, make suggestions, or raise concerns anonymously if they wish. Feedback chan- nels include hotlines and email addresses, complaint and suggestion boxes, and a feedback form on the company website. The company\u2019s policies allow patients to file reports without fear of reprisal. Fresenius Medical Care also provides training at the local level to support staff\nin following patient grievance guidelines.\nOur ambitions\nAs part of the global patient experience program, Fresenius Medical Care aims to conduct patient experience surveys at least every two years. Fresenius Medical Care aims to achieve an NPS score of at least 70 each year.\nProgress and measures in 2022\nIn the reporting year, Fresenius Medical Care implemented a new global measurement to track quality of care: the quality index. This index reflects the combined results of three equally weighted quality indicators:\n\u25b6 Dialysis effectiveness, which measures how sufficiently the body is cleansed of waste substances,\n\u25b6 vascular access, which measures the share of patients who do not receive dialysis via a dialysis catheter but rather via safer vascular access alternatives that reduce risk of infection and improve outcomes,\n\u25b6 anemia management, which measures hemoglobin levels and specific medications given during dialysis to achieve optimum clinical outcomes, such as overall health and well-being.\nThe company plans to use the indicator to continuously measure and improve quality of care on a global level. By the end of 2024, the business segment aims to develop and pilot a new global training program to further educate the medical community on quality improvement.\nEvaluation\nFresenius Medical Care evaluates medical indicators on an ongoing basis to measure the quality of care provided in its dialysis clinics. The global hospitalization rate measures the length of time a patient spends in hospital. This is an imp- ortant indicator, given that hospitalization has a significant impact on a patient\u2019s clinical outcomes and quality of life. In 2022, the global hospitalization rate was 10.6 days per patient (2021: 10.7).\nFresenius Medical Care measures patient experience in its dialysis clinics using the NPS. The NPS reflects patients\u2019 overall satisfaction with the services and to what extent they feel well cared for and supported. In 2022, the business segment attained an NPS score of 71, the same value as in 2021. The NPS threshold target of at least 70 reflects the com- pany\u2019s aim to continuously obtain excellent scores, and improve patient experience despite challenges such as staff- ing shortages and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the NPS calculations, the share of pat- ients is measured that would recommend Fresenius Medical Care. In the reporting year, 78% of the patients answered in the survey that they would highly recommend the ser- vices.\nIn addition to the NPS, Fresenius Medical Care also tracks survey coverage and response rates. In 2022, a global coverage rate of 92% was achieved in line with the target of 75% or above. The business segment attained a response rate of 69%.\nStrategy and management Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\n\n\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\n\u25b6 Compliance Committees which support the Heads of Compliance of the business segments in developing and monitoring the respective compliance management sys- tem. These functions report to the respective business segment management and functionally to the Group Chief Compliance Officer of the Fresenius Group, and\n\u25b6 Compliance responsibles in charge of organizational units of the respective segment.\nIn total, more than 400 employees throughout the Group are responsible for compliance tasks and support Fresenius managers and employees in all compliance-related matters.\nThe Group function Risk & Integrity of Fresenius\nSE & Co. KGaA advises the corporate functions of Fresenius\nSE & Co. KGaA, sets minimum standards for the compliance management systems Group-wide, and maintains the Group-wide compliance reporting. Within this Group func- tion, the Group Risk Management department supports the operation of compliance tools and systems as well as the development of training courses.\nRisk Steering Committee\nThe Risk Steering Committee (RSC) is chaired by the Manage- ment Board member responsible for Human Resources (Labor Relations Director), Risk Management and Legal. The RSC is further composed of the Group Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the heads of the Legal and Internal Audit departments. If necessary, representatives of other governance departments attend the\nmeetings of the RSC. The RSC is the advisory body that dis- cusses internal and external developments regarding the risk management and internal control system. This includes dev- elopments relevant for the Compliance Management Sys- tem, as well as important compliance initiatives such as the implementation of the German Act on Corporate Due Dili- gence Obligations in Supply Chains and the revision of the Group\u2019s case management policy in accordance with Euro- pean regulatory requirements. In addition, the RSC advises on significant risks and prepares decision proposals for the Fresenius Management Board. The meetings of the RSC are scheduled every six to eight weeks.\nReporting structure\nThe business segments have established individual reporting lines to their respective management. The management teams of the business segments receive regular reports on compliance by their Compliance Officers.\nCompliance cases are evaluated based on the Group- wide policies. The Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA informs the board member respon- sible for Human Resources (Labor Relations Director), Risk Management and Legal of FMSE about compliance cases of high severity immediately. Both decide whether the respec- tive case needs to be presented to the Management Board of FMSE. The Management Board of FMSE also receives from the Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius\nSE & Co. KGaA an annual overview of reported cases by cat- egory and business segment.\nIn addition to the regular updates in the Risk Steering Committee, the Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA provides the Management Board of FMSE\nwith a regular comprehensive update of all group-wide Com- pliance initiatives and policies. The Supervisory Boards of both Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA and FMSE are regularly informed about progress of compliance measures, at least once a year, most recently in October 2022.\nBest practice exchanges and compliance expert panels\nTo ensure ethical conduct, we continually review our busi- ness practices and exchange on best practices with our compliance colleagues worldwide. Regular exchanges in cross-divisional expert panels continued to take place in the reporting year. Areas of collaboration included foreign trade law, as well as anti-money laundering, whistleblower protection, and cross-border investigations.\nGuidelines and regulations\nThe Fresenius Code of Conduct forms the framework for all rules applicable in the Fresenius Group. The Code of Con- duct lays out the principles of conduct for all employees, including managers at all levels and members of the Man- agement Board. The Code is aligned with international reg- ulations, as explained below, and was adopted by the Man- agement Board of FMSE. In addition, the four business segments have implemented their own Codes of Conduct, which reflect the Fresenius Code of Conduct principles and are adapted to the individual characteristics of each business segment. The applicable Code of Conduct is part of the employment contracts in almost all business segments and\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n181\n\nRisk assessment and internal controls\nThe Management Board of FMSE is responsible for the qual- ity and effectiveness of our risk management and internal control system. It is regularly monitored by the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee as well as audited by the Internal Audit department. The findings from these audits are used to continuously advance our risk management and internal con- trol system.\nBy using standardized methods, we regularly record, ana- lyze, and evaluate compliance risks in each business seg- ment and at Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA. As part of an integrated risk reporting, eleven core Compliance risk subgroups are regularly reported and assessed: Bribery and corruption, fraud and asset misappropriation, antitrust violations, money laundering / terrorism financing, data protection viola- tions, trade restrictions, insider trading /market manipula- tion, compliance culture, retaliation, corporate governance, and human rights violations. In addition to these core compliance risks, the risk assessment also covers other sig- nificant business risks such as information security, environ- mental and occupational safety, quality assurance, and the protection of intellectual property, where the responsibility lies with other functions. The compliance responsibles exch- ange information on key findings from the respective risk assessments, which may result in additional Compliance Risk Subgroups to reflect new risk areas or risk clusters.\nThe internal control system is an important part of Fresenius\u2019 risk management. In addition to internal controls regarding the financial reporting, it includes control objec- tives for further critical processes, such as quality manage-\nment and patient safety, cybersecurity and data protection, and sustainability. Fresenius has documented relevant criti- cal control objectives in a Group-wide framework, inte- grating the various management systems into the internal control system in a holistic manner.\nDealing with third parties\nOur Code of Conduct and the related guidelines for Fresenius Group employees also regulate our relations with business partners and suppliers. We expect them to comply with appli- cable laws and standards as well as ethical standards of conduct in daily business and have specified this in our Fresenius Code of Conduct for Business Partners. Our ambi- tions to avoid corruption and bribery are laid down in our Codes of Conduct. Among other topics, the Codes explicitly prohibit corruption and bribery and oblige our partners to comply with relevant national and international anti-corrup- tion laws. Business segments with significant exposure to the interaction with healthcare professionals have specific rules for these interactions, as explained in the section Transparency in the healthcare sector in this chapter on page 185. In addition to risk-based business partner due dili- gence, we inform our business partners about these require- ments before entering a business relationship. The Codes of Conduct of the Fresenius Group are publicly accessible, for more information see Supply Chain section on pages 196 f.\nThe design and implementation of our compliance manage- ment systems are based on international regulations and guidelines, such as the ISO standards on the set-up of com- pliance management systems and applicable audit stan- dards of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany, Incor- porated Association IDW (PS 980). When implementing measures, we take into account the respective national or international legal frameworks.\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nMoney laundering\nBusiness segments within the scope of the Money Launder- ing Act for traders in goods have established appropriate measures to address money laundering risks. These mea- sures include internal controls, such as the prohibition of certain cash payments, as well as risk analysis and review processes for relevant transactions. The controls imple- mented are embedded in policies and appropriate training is provided.\nTrade restrictions\nTo provide people worldwide with access to lifesaving med- icine and medical equipment, Fresenius also supplies prod- ucts to countries that are subject to trade restrictions. How- ever, such deliveries have been exempted from the relevant sanctions and Fresenius expects the scope of the exemption to remain unchanged. It is particularly important to us to comply with all currently applicable legal provisions, e. g., with regard to sanctions or export controls. To this end, we have introduced various measures in the business segments concerned, such as special IT system checks for deliveries that are subject to import or export restrictions. In our cor- porate and business segments we have dedicated experts for trade compliance and a trade compliance program in pla- ce. Regular exchange calls among experts and with the management are held to ensure up-to-date knowledge on trade and economic sanctions. There are also centralized monitoring programs at Fresenius for certain countries sub- ject to applicable sanction programs. The trade compliance program will be continuously updated to reflect the latest\nsanctions regulations. We aim to ensure that we can comply with all applicable sanctions and requirements for export controls, even in the event of short-term changes in legisla- tion, such as experienced in 2022. We have no evidence that Fresenius has not complied with applicable sanctions and export control requirements.\nCompliance training\nCompliance training is a high priority for Fresenius. Our employees are offered training on compliance issues, cover- ing basic topics such as our Code of Conduct and corporate guidelines. Depending on the employee group, more specific topics such as anti-corruption, antitrust law, anti-money- laundering, data protection, and information security are also included \u2013 especially for particularly high-risk areas.\nTo convey the content in a targeted manner, we rely on individual concepts tailored to the respective department and employees. We use various formats such as in-house trai- ning, live webinars, on-demand video training, and tradi- tional online training. Participation in essential basic training, such as on the Code of Conduct, is mandatory. Mandatory e-learnings will be distributed to all employees of the defined target group.\nEmployees are prompted and reminded to participate in mandatory training courses, for example with automatic registration, or manual registration by compliance depart- ments, human resources, or managers. To promote a risk-conscious and value-oriented corporate culture, we train executives using a dialog-based approach.\nReporting channels and dealing\nwith potential compliance violations\nIf Fresenius employees suspect misconduct, e. g., violations of laws, regulations or internal guidelines, they can contact their supervisors or the responsible compliance officers and report the potential compliance incident. They can also report potential compliance incidents anonymously, where legally permitted, e. g., by telephone or online via whis- tleblower systems and e-mail addresses set up specifically for this purpose. All business segments have established appro- priate mechanisms based on the requirements of the UN Gui- ding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains. Further, all segments have prepared to comply with the laws implementing the new EU regulation regarding the protection of whistleblowers. The whis- tleblower systems are available via the Fresenius Group web- site and the websites of the business segments not only to employees, but also to third parties, e. g., customers, suppli- ers, and other partners, in a total of more than 30 languages.\nWe strive to continuously improve our processes and fur- ther optimize the complaint mechanisms. Based on the requirements of the UNGP, the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains, and the European Union Directive on the protection of whistleblowers and their implementation in national law, we have reviewed our sys- tems and processes and adjusted them accordingly. We are therefore convinced that the complaint mechanism of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA in its current form meets the cur- rently applicable requirements. Thus, the business segments\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n184\n Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nobserve the developments in this area and adapt their pro- cesses as needed, based on the mentioned legal require- ments and international applicable frameworks. This encom- passes measures to support a culture in which legal and ethical concerns may be communicated without fear of retal- iation. Fresenius Medical Care has an anti-retaliation policy in place to protect employees against any reprisal. Fresenius Kabi has put in place an updated case manage- ment Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which also inclu- des a strict non-retaliation policy.\nIncoming reports are treated confidentially as described in the respective guidelines to protect persons reporting. Depending on the severity of the case, the business segments adhere to the reporting structure as outlined on page 181. We take all potential compliance violations seriously. An ini- tial assessment focuses on the plausibility and possible severity level of the potential violation. For this purpose, also ombudsperson panels are set up at Fresenius SE & Co.\nKGaA, Fresenius Kabi, Fresenius Helios, and Fresenius Vam- ed. These carry out preliminary assessments of reports received and initiate risk-appropriate investigations of reports on a case-by-case basis. The severity of the compliance violation determines who is responsible for further investiga- tion. If necessary, a dedicated team takes over the investi- gation, which may include internal professionals or external support. Measures are implemented in a timely manner by the responsible management in close cooperation with the\ncompliance officers. Depending on the type and severity of the misconduct, disciplinary sanctions or remedies under civil or criminal law may be imposed. We take every case of potential misconduct as an opportunity to review our cor- porate processes for improvements. After completion of the investigation, we use the results of internal reviews and reports to review our business processes. We implement cor- rective or improvement measures where necessary to pre- vent similar misconduct in the future. Fresenius Medical Care as well has a defined procedure in which all reported cases of potential misconduct are investigated, individual measures are taken to remedy them, and implementation is tracked. We report the compliance reports received in 2022 in the Evaluation section on page 188.\nTransparency in the healthcare sector\nIn the healthcare sector, transparency is of major importance with regard to business conduct, patient information and quality of care. More information can be found in the Patient and product safety chapter on pages 110 ff.\nFresenius Group companies adhere to laws and our ethical principles that\n\u25b6 require us to track and report publicly payments made to healthcare professionals and organizations;\n\u25b6 require us to issue written notification or approval and to disclose the purpose and scope of the interaction between a Fresenius Group company and healthcare professionals, such as in healthcare facilities;\n\u25b6 require us to publicly disclose data pursued in clinical trials as well as disclose to patients the information\ngathered in patient studies. This is linked to the public right to transparency regarding data used to approve new medicines, as well as provisions to adhere to relevant data protection standards; for more information see Data Protection section on pages 189f.;\n\u25b6 require transparency in pricing and reimbursement pro- cedures for pharmaceutical products.\nWe are committed to respecting the codes and principles associated with membership of various associations. In addition, Fresenius Group companies disclose all donations to healthcare professionals in accordance with the publica- tion requirements applicable to them.\nPROGRESS AND MEASURES IN 2022\nReporting structure\nIn order to further foster a functional Group-wide compliance organization, the Management Board of FMSE decided that the compliance professionals will functionally report to the Heads of Compliance of each business segment, effective in 2023. Where such reporting structures have not been estab- lished, they will be initiated. The Heads of Compliance of each segment and the Head of Group Compliance Reporting and Monitoring form the Group Compliance Management Team (GCMT). This expert group sets governance standards for Compliance across Fresenius and supports the effective implementation of the Compliance management system.\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n185\n Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nContinual improvement of the Fresenius compliance program\nIn 2022, the business segments planned and implemented various compliance initiatives to drive further improvement or to respond to new regulatory requirements. For Fresenius as a Group, a dedicated Human Rights Office has been tasked with coordinating the preparation for the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains. For more information, please refer to the Supply chain section starting on page 196. A revised Group-wide Case Manage- ment SOP will reflect the requirements under the applicable whistleblower protection laws in Europe.\nFresenius Kabi conducted a compliance culture survey and thereby opened another channel for its employees to voice views about the company\u2019s compliance culture, particu- larly in relation to speak up culture, case reporting and case management. The business segment also updated its report- ing categories for its complaint management, offering simpler clusters of violations to potential whistleblowers, that include categories relevant for reporting human rights violations.\nFurther, new guidelines and regulations within the busi- ness segments were addressed as follows: Fresenius Kabi updated its Code of Conduct in the reporting year, taking into account more recent developments such as anti-money\nlaundering, sustainability, cybersecurity, social media, envi- ronment, and human rights. The business segment also updated its case management SOP and collateral documen- tation, such as templates for investigation plans and investi- gation reports, to take into account the requirements of the recent legislation updates and to further increase the quality and consistency of case management work across the globe. Fresenius Helios also revised its case management guide- line. All business segments also decided to continue the fur- ther implementation of the Internal Controls Framework.\nTo support this development of the Fresenius compliance program, focus training topics were set in 2022:\n\u25b6 The Group function Risk & Integrity developed and pro- vided various training materials regarding the Code of Conduct, anti-money-laundering, anti-corruption, anti- trust, trade compliance, fraud and internal control sys- tems for all business segments.\n\u25b6 Fresenius Kabi continued its intensive efforts to train its personnel on antitrust risks and created a new com- prehensive antitrust training course that has been made available internally on the intranet and was also rolled out as an eLearning to sensitive functions in various lan- guages. Selected groups were additionally trained in web- inar sessions on particular antitrust topics for their area of responsibility. Fresenius Kabi rolled out its global anti- bribery and anti-corruption eLearning again, as a refresher training.\n\u25b6 Fresenius Helios offered training courses on fraud and rolled out dedicated trainings on specific aspects of anti-corruption, such as accepting benefits as business employees, donations, granting benefits to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, and conflicts of interest.\n\u25b6 In the reporting year, Helios Spain began preparing additional training courses for the risks identified in the compliance risk assessment in addition to the existing training courses on the Code of Conduct.\n\u25b6 Fresenius Vamed focused on data protection, anti-money laundering and trade compliance trainings.\n\u25b6 Fresenius Medical Care has its own compliance management system and a correspondingly coordinated training program.\nRisk assessment and internal controls\nIn 2022, the business segments expanded their risk assess- ment processes, which they continued to carry out to include bottom-up information.\nWe made further improvements within our Group-wide integrated risk management tool to implement applicable regulatory requirements. Risk entries are validated by subject matter experts, i. e. the Compliance function, in order to ensure the consistency and quality of these entries. Risk mitigation plans will be tracked and monitored to ensure\na steady mitigation effect.\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n186\n Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents\nDue to the constantly changing external and internal require- ments and environment, our risk management and internal control system is being continuously developed. Currently 25 out of 139 control objectives are related to compliance processes, in particular in the areas anti-corruption, trade compliance, anti-money laundering, antitrust/competition compliance. In 2022, the internal control system has been further expanded by the business segments, including structured scoping and performance of control testing.\nDedicated monitoring programs\nfor trade compliance\nSince sanctions have been imposed against certain countries because of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Man- agement Board of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA has implemented a monitoring mechanism to ensure that trade compliance approvals and the review of business partners are mandatory for each delivery into a country subject to a sanction pro- gram. In addition, automated IT-based checks for each trans- action at Fresenius Kabi are an integral part of the trade compliance program.\nDevelopments in the business partner\ndue diligence\nThe business partner due diligence process is being enhanced to achieve more accuracy and efficiency in add- ressing risks with its third parties and integrated the requirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence\nObligations in Supply Chains. Human rights due diligence as one aspect of our overall business partner due diligence enables us to better understand our suppliers and their modus operandi. This way, we monitor potential risks occur- ring from the supply chain while adhering to our commit- ments to conducting business in a responsible manner, to human rights, and to our commitment to compliance and integrity. Further information on human rights due diligence and our 2022 progress can be found in the Supply chain chapter on page 198.\nFresenius Medical Care sharpened its focus on several ongoing compliance initiatives. Prior to entering new busi- ness relationships, and as part of its continuous monitoring of existing business relationships, the company assesses third parties for compliance risks. In 2022, the business seg- ment assessed and approved around 21,000 third parties. In addition, Fresenius Medical Care continued to implement its third-party training approach at global level. Target groups are sales partners, such as distributors, re-sellers, wholesal- ers, commercial or sales agents, and any other third parties involved in the sales of the products that potentially interact with government officials or healthcare professionals. The business segment also conducted 15 anti-corruption-related audits of third-party business partners. 80% of internal audits included a compliance focus.\nFresenius Kabi published its updated SOP and collateral guidelines on Business Partner Due Diligence to enhance and refine its processes and conducted related training for key stakeholders, as well as updated its contractual com- pliance clauses for business partners and suppliers. Further- more, Fresenius Kabi has combined the previously separate\ncodes for suppliers (Suppliers Code of Conduct) and for business partners (Business Partner Code of Conduct) into a Third-Party Code of Conduct and published it at the end of the year. This also includes the expectations of suppliers and business partners with regards to human rights and environmental standards/duties of care in the supply chain.\nEVALUATION\nDespite the differences in business and risk profile in each business segment, we strive to uniformly evaluate the design of the compliance management systems on a Group level. In 2022, aspects of the effectiveness of compliance mea- sures were surveyed after the Group function Risk & Integrity department of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA reviewed the matu- rity of the compliance measures of the business segments and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA for all compliance risk areas by using a harmonized Compliance Management System Reporting methodology. The results were presented to\nthe Management Board and Supervisory Board.\nAudits and inspections\nThe Internal Audit departments conduct independent audits to improve the effectiveness of the risk management, control and governance processes at Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA and in the business segments.

Fresenius Kabi reviews these key parameters annually and defines monitoring mea- sures for those subsidiaries with an increased risk profile. Fresenius Kabi also conducts regular reviews of compliance initiatives in the form of workshops. Fresenius Kabi\u2019s com- pliance organization organized various international work- shops again in 2022. The workshops not only served as intensive training for local employees, but also enabled com- pliance officers to review and, if necessary, improve their understanding of compliance, the effectiveness of local imple- mentation of internal guidelines, and the development and improvement of central compliance initiatives.\nReports in 2022\nIn 2022, a total of 375 compliance reports1 were received via the incident databases at Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, and the business segments Fresenius Kabi, Fresenius Helios, and Fresenius Vamed. They were collected via different input channels as shown in the graph. The compliance reports were principally assigned to the following topic groups: Busi- ness Integrity (88 reports, incl. Anti-Corruption, Antitrust, Anti-Money-Laundering etc.), Data Protection (26 reports), HR / Workplace (155 reports), Misappropriation of Corpo- rate Assets (35 reports, incl. Conflicts of Interest), Account- ing, Auditing and Financial Reporting (8 reports), Environ- ment, Health and Safety (23 reports), and other (40 reports).\nWe received the most complaints in the area of Business Integrity and workplace-related, in particular, in clinics. Each complaint is reviewed under our case management pro- cesses and, if substantiated, appropriate remedial measures will be taken.\nDATA PROTECTION\nOUR APPROACH\nWe bear responsibility in a sensitive environment on which the lives and health of many people depend. Accordingly, we know how to reconcile high quality standards with eco- nomical, IT-supported processes in our regulated markets. In doing so, we are always aware of the increasing sensitiv- ity and need for protection of the data and information we process. In this way, we design efficient processes and create scope for what is really important: the protection and safety of patients.\nThe Fresenius Group and its operating entities process, e. g. personal and other data of\n\u25b6 our patients,\n\u25b6 our employees,\n\u25b6 customers,\n\u25b6 suppliers, and other business partners.\ncorruption are also taken into account on a risk basis. If weaknesses are identified, Internal Audit monitors the imple- mentation of remediation actions taken by the respective management. In 2022, 21 internal audits with a focus on cor- ruption were conducted at operating sites of the business segments Fresenius Helios, Fresenius Kabi, Fresenius Vamed and Fresenius Corporate. The audit engagement results were analyzed by the compliance organizations and incorpo- rated into the continuous improvement of existing measures. Structural changes of the processes related to the compliance organizations were not required.\nAt Helios Germany, adherence to the business segment\u2019s transparency regulations is monitored on a random basis\nin regular transparency reviews.\nWith the Compliance Cockpit, Fresenius Kabi has a tool that provides managers of each subsidiary with an annual overview of compliance-relevant key parameters based on\nStrategy and management | Well-being of the patient | Digital transformation and innovation | Cybersecurity | Employees | Occupational health and safety\nDiversity and equal opportunities Compliance and integrity | Environment | Further key figures | Report profile | Limited assurance report of the independent auditor\n1 For Fresenius Medical Care in North America, the hotline system was used for multiple reporting purposes: In addition to the reporting of compliance concerns, reports can also be made on patient care and safety. Therefore, cases from Fresenius Medical Care are not consolidated on a Group level. This leads to a corre- sponding reduction of compliance reports in comparison to the previous year.\n188\n       Fresenius | Annual Report 2022\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents Corporate Governance Declaration | Further information on Corporate Governance\nRELEVANT DISCLOSURES ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES\nThe general partner, represented by its Management Board, manages the Company\u2019s business with the due care and diligence of a prudent and conscientious company director in compliance with the provisions of the law, the articles\nof association, the rules of procedure for the Management Board, the resolutions passed by the full Management Board, and the Supervisory Board of the general partner. The basic rules of corporate conduct, partly extending beyond the requirements of law, are defined in the Fresenius Code of Conduct. It defines the framework of our rules and specifies the key principles for our conduct within the Company and in our relations with external partners and\nthe public. We have published the Fresenius Code of Con- duct on our website at www.fresenius.com/compliance. In addition, all Fresenius business segments have implemented their own Codes of Conduct. They cover the specifics of their businesses and reflect the values of the Fresenius Code of Conduct.\nCOMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\nFor Fresenius, compliance means doing the right thing. Because our core ethical values go beyond regulatory requirements, it means acting not only in accordance with the law, but also with applicable industry codes, internal policies, and our values. Compliance is part of our corpo- rate culture and, consequently, our daily work.\nEach of our business segments has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer, or a dedicated Compliance function, responsible for overseeing the development, implementation,\nand monitoring of the Compliance Management System (CMS) of the business segment. Furthermore, in line with the business structure and organization, the business seg- ments have established compliance responsibilities at the respective organizational levels. The respective compli- ance organization supports management and employees in all compliance-related principles.\nOur Compliance Management Systems are designed to achieve the implementation of and adherence to our rules within the Company. We have implemented risk-based Compliance Management Systems in all our business seg- ments and at Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA\u2019s corporate level. They comprise three pillars: Prevent, Detect, and Respond. Emphasis is placed on actively preventing any acts of non- compliance before they occur. Such systems consider the markets Fresenius is operating in. They are tailored to the specific requirements of each business segment.\nEssential measures for prevention include comprehen- sive risk recording and risk assessment, effective policies\nas well as adequate and effective procedures, regular train- ing, and continuous advice. Through objective indicators, we try to detect potential compliance risks early on. To this end, we have implemented tools for early risk detection and internal control structures, e.g., for cash and bank transac- tions, and monitor these measures regularly in workshops and internal audits.\nWe take even potential misconduct seriously. This is why Fresenius employees who are aware of potential misconduct, can contact their superior or the responsible compliance function or report a potential compliance case anonymously through whistleblowing systems or dedicated e-mail addresses. Most whistleblowing systems are open\nnot only to employees, but also to third parties, such as cus- tomers, suppliers, and other partners, via the corporate website in many languages.\nAny illegal actions or violations of the rules may harm the individual and Fresenius. We do not tolerate non-com- pliance. If a violation of applicable regulations is detected, we will take the necessary actions to remediate the viola- tion and prevent any recurrence.

Fresenius has a systematic risk management and control system that allows the Manage- ment Board to identify risks and market trends at an early stage and to react promptly to relevant changes in our risk profile. It consists of the following elements:\n\nTo our shareholders Group Management Report Group Non-Financial Report Corporate Governance Consolidated financial statements Further information Table of contents Corporate Governance Declaration | Further information on Corporate Governance\nThe well-being of our patients is important to us. Our risk management and control system, as well as efficiently designed processes, help to enhance the Company\u2019s perfor- mance. Our early risk detection system is reviewed as part\nof the annual audit of the financial statements. The auditor assesses whether the monitoring system set up by the Management Board is suitable for the early identification of risks that could jeopardize the Company\u2019s existence. The risk management and control systems are regularly reviewed by the Management Board and the Internal Audit department. The quality and effectiveness of our risk management and control system is the responsibility of the Management Board and is regularly monitored by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and audited by Internal Audit. Findings from these audits are incorporated into the ongoing development of the risk management and control system.\nFurther information is available on page 19 of the Report of the Supervisory Board.\nIn line with the German Corporate Governance Code, our risk management and control system also covers the sustainability-related objectives anchored in our corporate strategy to the extent that this is not already required by law. This includes the processes and systems for record- ing and processing sustainability-related data. Further information (including the description of the main features of the overall internal control system and risk management system recommended by the Code and the statement on the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems also recommended by the Code) can be found in the Group Management Report on pages 85 ff.\nThe Internal Audit department supports the Manage- ment Board as an independent function outside the Com- pany\u2019s day-to-day operations. The department assesses internal processes from an objective viewpoint and with the necessary distance. Their goal is to create added value for Fresenius, and thus to help achieve organizational goals through improved internal controls, optimized business processes, and efficiency increases. Results from internal audits are analyzed both by the business segments and by the compliance organization to continuously improve pre- ventive measures, for example to prevent corruption.\nFresenius Medical Care AG & Co.

In order to prevent compliance issues and make sure they follow the rules, they also implement internal controls. Fresenius has well-established internal controls in the compliance management procedures in this regard as well. The Fresenius Group's management board, which is headed by the labour relations director, risk management, and legal departments of Fresenius Management SE (FMSE), has been tasked with overseeing compliance. \n- The Member of the Management Board in charge of Human Resources (Labour Relations Director), Risk Management, and Legal is directly subordinate to the Fresenius Group's Group Chief Compliance Officer. \n- The business segments have set up separate channels of communication with their respective managers. When allowed by law, they can also report possible compliance incidents anonymously, for example, over the phone or online using whistleblower services and email accounts created especially for this purpose. The Compliance Officers of each business sector provide frequent compliance reports to the management teams. The investment committee is therefore not independent.  \n- Cases of compliance are assessed in accordance with the group-wide policies. When a compliance situation of high severity arises, the Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA promptly notifies the board member in charge of Human Resources (Labour Relations Director), Risk Management, and Legal of FMSE. Both determine whether the relevant case needs to be brought before the FMSE Management Board. The Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co.

The combined non-financial information statement presented here has , however , been reviewed with limited assurance by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers in accordance with the audit standard ISAE 3000 ( Revised ) ( see here the Independent Auditor \u2019 s Report on page 270 et seq . ) .IntroductionThe present combined non-financial information statement was drawn up in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e German Commercial Code ( HGB ) as well as Ar-ticle 8 of Regulation ( EU ) 2020/852 of the European Parlia-ment and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment , and amending Regulation ( EU ) 2019/2088 ( hereinafter EU Taxon-omy Regulation ) . The identification of material contents re-flected the materiality definitions of the Global Reporting Ini-tiative ( GRI ) and the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) . The description of concepts is guided by the structure of the GRI Standards.The combined non-financial information statement encom-passes \u2013 unless presented separately \u2013 the disclosures for the Group and the parent company Hannover R\u00fcck SE . It con-tains the legally required information relating to material en-vironmental matters , employee matters , social matters , re-spect for human rights and fighting corruption and bribery . Within the individual aspects , the underlying concepts and internal due diligence processes are discussed and available findings are reported . The identified material issues were allocated to the aspects ( see section \u201c Materiality analysis \u201d ) . In addition , the combined non-financial information state-ment is to be used to report on material risks pursuant to \u00a7 289c Para . 3 No . 3 and 4 German Commercial Code ( HGB ) to the extent necessary for an understanding of the business development , business result , position of Hannover R\u00fcck SE and the Group as well as of the implications for non-financial matters.Information is also included pursuant to the requirements of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.Pursuant to \u00a7 315b Para . 1 Sentence 3 German Commercial Code ( HGB ) , reference is also made to non-financial disclo-sures provided elsewhere in the combined management re-port with respect to certain aspects . References to informa-tion outside the combined management report and the consolidated and annual financial statement do not form part of the combined non-financial information statement.For a description of the business model the reader is referred to the subsection \u201c Business model \u201d under \u201c Foundations of the Group \u201d .Strategic orientationThe Group strategy of Hannover Re was revised most recent-ly in 2020 and is valid for the 2021 \u2013 2023 strategy cycle.In our \u201c Striving for sustainable outperformance \u201d strong gov-ernance , risk management , integrated compliance and corpo-rate social responsibility constitute the foundations for our growth as a reliable global reinsurance partner . Three perfor-mance drivers \u2013 preferred business partner , innovation cata-lyst , earnings growth \u2013 are based on proven strengths and address the global trends affecting the insurance and reinsur-ance industry . Three performance enablers \u2013 empowered people , a lean operating model and effective capital manage-ment \u2013 have proven essential over the last decade for , among other things , outperforming the industry average in terms of the return on equity.We have launched four strategic initiatives \u2013 Client Excel-lence , Innovation and Digitalisation , the Asia-Pacific Growth Initiative and Talent Management \u2013 that we consider espe-cially crucial . We have worked on them since the launch of the strategy cycle in 2021 and will continue to do so . These Hannover Re | Annual Report 202260four strategic initiatives are at the heart of the strategic pro-gramme , which encompasses altogether 25 programme items and directly supports the Group strategy . Major Group projects ( known as value streams ) and joint strategy contri-butions spanning multiple departments are also integral com-ponents of this programme . \u201c Corporate Social Responsibili-ty \u201d is one of these joint strategy contributions that we are refining in the strategy cycle 2021 \u2013 2023 and in which we pursue non-financial goals , among others . Associated topics are specified more closely in our Sustainability Strategy 2021 \u2013 2023 . This is comprised of the four action fields Trans-parency , Employees , Core Business and Commitment as well as underlying measures and goals . The sustainability strategy is publicly available on our website . The strategic programme is supported and monitored by the Group Strategy & Sustain-ability department and progress reports are provided to the Executive Board quarterly ( reporting on strategic initiatives ) and half-yearly ( management reporting ) .In the 2022 reporting year work commenced on the Group strategy for the new strategy cycle 2024 \u2013 2026.Materiality analysis and material topicsHannover Re regularly conducts materiality analyses in order to identify material ESG ( environmental , social and govern-ance ) issues , most recently in the spring of 2020 in the form of interviews / workshops with internal and external experts . The basis consisted of a list of possible topics derived from the materiality analysis conducted in 2018 , dialogues with stakeholders and non-governmental organisations , media re-ports and the GRI Framework . All experts were encouraged to indicate other topics.The analysis looked at two dimensions ( so-called double ma-teriality ) : positive/negative impacts of Hannover Re \u2019 s opera-tions on the respective topic ( inside-out perspective ) and pos-itive/negative impacts of the respective topic on Hannover Re \u2019 s operations ( outside-in perspective ) . Each topic was scored on a scale of 1 to 5 in this regard . Extensive interviews were conducted with the external experts ( stakeholder group : asset managers , ESG analysts , representatives of non-govern-mental organisations , representatives of the trade press as well as representatives of foundations and associations ) . All topics that received an average score of at least 3.75 were marked as material . Four workshops were held with the inter-nal experts ( stakeholder group : employees ) from various market and service units to score the topics on the list . In this case , too , the materiality threshold was set at 3.75 . Some top-ics were clustered at the workshops . As a result , 13 material topics were identified.The materiality analysis was compiled most recently in 2020 and validated by the Executive Board in 2021 as well as the 2022 reporting year . The topic of Covid-19 , which had been included in the previous year , was removed again on grounds of diminishing materiality . The materiality analysis was guid-ed by the GRI Standards ( 2016 ) , with no framework used for the 2022 validation . In 2023 it is envisaged that a materiality analysis will be conducted according to the parameters of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards ( ESRS ) as well as the GRI Standards 2021 . 61Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022 Combined management report Allocation of the non-fiancial aspects to the material topicsM 40 Non-financial aspectMaterial topicEnvironmental mattersClimate changeSustainable protectionESG in insurance businessESG in asset management Risk managementEmployee mattersAttractiveness as an employer Learning and developmentHealth and wellness of employeesDiversity and equal opportunitiesSocial mattersDialogueSustainable protectionESG in asset managementRespect for human rightsHuman rightsESG in insurance businessESG in asset managementFighting corruption and briberyComplianceGood governanceRisk Management SystemIn the course of its operations as a reinsurance company Han-nover Re knowingly enters into many different risks . It is equipped with an adequate and effective risk management system for ongoing monitoring of these and other risks.In the context of its risk management system Hannover Re also considers risks that arise in connection with environ-mental concerns , social issues or corporate governance \u2013 so-called sustainability or ESG risks . These may be associated with negative implications for the net assets , financial posi-tion and results of operations ( outside-in ) as well as negative implications for the ESG landscape ( inside-out ) . Both risk perspectives can affect , among other things , the company \u2019 s reputation . Sustainability risks do not constitute a risk cate-gory of their own , but can instead have implications for all risk categories and are included in the risk register under \u201c Other risks \u201d as the meta-risk \u201c Sustainability and reputation-al risks \u201d .Back in 2021 the Executive Board had already approved a framework valid throughout the Group for the management of sustainability and reputational risks.For further information we would refer to the \u201c Opportunity and risk report \u201d in the combined Group management report . Hannover Re | Annual Report 202262Compliance Management SystemCompliance encompasses not only compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements ( legal compliance ) but also ful-filment of external standards , such as those from the German Corporate Governance Code , as well as internal guidelines . At Hannover Re , compliance topics are addressed in a compli-ance management system . This is geared to international standards and ensures that the core tasks of a compliance function are performed : \u2022 Examining and evaluating changes in the legal / regulatory environment and determining measures ( monitoring function ) \u2022 Advising the Executive Board and the employees on compliance with laws ( advisory function ) \u2022 Identifying and evaluating specific current and emerging compliance risks ( identification function ) \u2022 Identifying and assessing material compliance risks ( risk function ) The Executive Board is responsible for and tasked with ensur-ing adequate and effective compliance structures . Execution falls to the Chief Compliance Officer ( CCO ) , who reports in a direct line to the Executive Board on material compliance is-sues and developments . The annual compliance report is also submitted to the Supervisory Board and its Finance and Audit Committee . The CCO is supported in his work by the Compli-ance department , specially designated officers and a world-wide network of local compliance officers . Monitoring proce-dures are conducted for the management of compliance risks . Checks can also take place on an ad hoc basis where there are grounds for suspicion . The underlying compliance risk analy-sis is updated annually.The CCO works closely with Risk Management to ensure a consistent approach to operational risks , which include com-pliance risks . Several compliance committees also exist , com-prised of members from the operational business groups as well as from the areas of Group Legal , Finance , Accounting and Investments . Among other things , the compliance com-mittees examine reinsurance treaties with a special eye to compliance with supervisory requirements and accounting standards and they take fundamental decisions on dealing with sanctions.Attentive and trained employees constitute a crucial compo-nent of a functioning compliance management system \u2013 both to avoid unconscious violations and to recognise and prevent deliberate violations and associated risks . Hannover Re uses various training activities to raise employee awareness of compliance-related issues . On joining the Group and through-out the entire duration of their employment , all members of staff receive compliance training . In addition , focused train-ing activities are held on various compliance topics through-out the year for specific target groups . This is supplemented by dedicated compliance pages in the intranet containing more extensive information.Should members of staff or indeed persons outside the com-pany become aware of compliance violations , harmful behav-iour or risks , such suspicions can be reported to the CCO or the Compliance department or , if so desired , anonymously through an online speak-up system.For further information , we would refer to the \u201c Opportunity and risk report \u201d in the combined Group management report.Environmental mattersIn connection with environmental matters , special impor-tance attaches to the active exploration of the causes and consequences of progressive climate change . Extreme weath-er events and natural disasters such as heatwaves and droughts , severe precipitation events and storms , as well as continuous processes such as glacier melting and rising sea levels , have far-reaching implications for society and the economy and lead to considerable economic and insured losses . What is more , further environmental concerns , such as the proper functioning of ecosystems or the water resourc-es of ground and surface waters , are directly affected by cli-mate change . If the earth \u2019 s temperature were to continue ris-ing unchecked , this would increase the scale of such phenomena and risks . Yet the sought-after transition to a cli-mate-friendly , resource-saving economy is also associated with a number of social and economic impacts.In view of these comprehensive environmental , economic and social impacts , climate change is at the heart of numerous national and international regulatory initiatives and meas-ures . The goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change , under which the international community committed in 2015 to limit the rise in the global average temperature to well be-low 2 \u00b0C , preferably to 1.5 \u00b0C , compared to pre-industrial lev-els , are considered a key driving force here . Overall , far-reach-ing implications for the real economy and for the financial sector are to be anticipated in this connection . 63Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022 Combined management reportThe 1.5 \u00b0C goal was also maintained at the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh ( Egypt ) , known as COP27 . A non-binding work programme to close the emis-sions gap to the 1.5 \u00b0C target by 2030 is running until 2026 with the option to extend until 2030 . A final cover decision reiterated the decision already taken at the 2021 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow , COP26 , to phase out energy generation from coal and abolish inefficient subsidies for fos-sil fuels . At the same time , low-emission and renewable ener-gy sources are to be expanded.Impacts on operationsClimate change goes hand-in-hand with a range of impacts on Hannover Re \u2019 s operations , e. g. due to an increase in the frequency and / or severity of losses ( physical risks ) or chang-ing framework conditions with implications for reinsurance business and investments ( transition risks ) . Furthermore , on the societal level an increase in environment-related lawsuits against businesses and public institutions can be observed ( litigation risks ) that may adversely affect the insurance in-dustry.The risks posed by climate change can affect numerous risk categories of the risk register and are extensively monitored through the risk management system . ESG topics are also ad-dressed as part of the management of sustainability and rep-utational risks . For information on the corresponding con-cepts and implemented stress test mechanisms the reader is referred to the \u201c Opportunity and risk report \u201d .When it comes to evaluating impacts and risks , one advan-tage is that business in property and casualty reinsurance is normally renewed annually . This means that it is possible to adjust the premiums or risk appetite each year according to the conducted risk assessment and hence manage the expo-sure on a risk-oriented basis . For information on the indus-try-specific environment and the results of operations in property and casualty reinsurance , please see the section \u201c Report on economic position \u201d .Impacts of our operationsInsurance businessFossil fuels are considered to be one of the major drivers of climate change . With a view to countering this and facilitating the transformation to a lower-carbon economy , we support among other steps the expansion of renewable energy sourc-es . These range from wind energy ( both onshore and off-shore ) to photovoltaic and geothermal energy . Insurance pro-tection begins with installation of the equipment and accompanies customers through many years of operation . In addition , we support special coverages for the roll-out of new technologies , such as performance guarantees for fuel cells ( that convert hydrogen or natural gas into electricity ) . Fur-thermore , our products support the development of hydrogen infrastructure worldwide and we are participating in initial large-scale projects to advance the energy transition.At the same time , Hannover Re is consistently seeking to re-duce its exposure to fossil fuels . The goal is to no longer cov-er any risks connected with the mining of and energy gener-ation from power plant and thermal coal by the year 2038 in the entire portfolio of property and casualty reinsurance busi-ness . In the year under review we adopted our internal posi-tioning for the property and casualty reinsurance sector , which fleshes out this approach in greater detail and address-es further issues ( such as oil and gas ) . The position paper is applicable to both facultative and obligatory business.In facultative reinsurance business , covers are written for in-dividual risks , i. e. the treaties can be allocated to specific pro-jects or policyholders.Supplementary to the position paper for the property and casualty reinsurance sector , the facultative division has its own more specific ESG manual that deals with environmental concerns and specifies exclusions , among other things.Since as long ago as April 2019 the facultative division has no longer provided reinsurance for planned new coal-fired plants or thermal coal mines . Moreover , from February 2020 on-wards all new facultative business connected with thermal coal or the associated infrastructure has been excluded . Thermal coal infrastructure encompasses mines , coal-fired power plants and facilities as well as port and rail operations allocable exclusively to the coal industry . In the case of mixed groups , companies are excluded that generate more than 30 % of their revenues from activities in thermal coal . As an additional step , an exit plan for existing facultative business in thermal coal was adopted in 2021 . The phased plan pro-vides for exclusions based on thresholds . As a first step , the facultative division will scale back business with thermal coal producers whose annual production volume from all mines amounts to 100 million tonnes or more as well as business with the operators of coal-fired power plants whose installed total capacity from coal power stations amounts to 25 giga-watts or more ( reference date 31 December 2025 ) . It is envis-aged that these thresholds will be progressively reduced in the following years until complete exclusion of such risks . Hannover Re | Annual Report 202264Any expansion of existing capacities in the context of treaty renewals is already ruled out.Complementing the measures described in relation to ther-mal coal , the exclusions for oil and gas were also expanded in the year under review . Since mid-2022 the facultative division is no longer taking on any new covers for project policies as-sociated with the exploration and / or development of new ( greenfield ) oil and gas reserves ( upstream ) or for project pol-icies that exclusively support the transportation and storage ( midstream ) of new ( greenfield ) oil and gas reserves . Since as long ago as 2020 the facultative division has no longer ac-cepted any new individual risks for companies that hold 20 % or more of their oil reserves in oil sands and it excludes oil sands extraction and processing operations . Oil sands extrac-tion and processing encompass the extraction of bitumen from bituminous sand , refinement into synthetic crude oil , further processing of this synthetic crude into petroleum products and the associated transportation by pipeline or rail.Furthermore , since 2021 the facultative division has no longer accepted any new risks connected with projects for the ex-traction of oil and gas in Arctic regions \u2013 this policy applies to both greenfield and brownfield projects . We define \u201c Arctic regions \u201d as the zone around the Arctic Circle which runs in a circle of latitude 66.34\u00b0 north of the Equator . This includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) in the United States . In addition , no risks are written that are connected with the development of new oil and gas deposits in deep waters below 5,000 feet or deep sea mining.The facultative division similarly declines transactions if they may entail damage to wetlands protected under the Ramsar Convention or UNESCO world cultural heritage sites.In obligatory reinsurance , large-volume portfolios with some-times heterogenous contents are accepted . We are engaged in talks with our customers to obtain an overview of the CO2 intensity of the business ceded to us . We are already refrain-ing from writing new treaties in obligatory reinsurance that are to be used exclusively for coverage of thermal coal risks . The same is true of new treaties exclusively associated with the exploration and / or development of new ( greenfield ) oil and gas reserves ( upstream ) or for project policies that exclu-sively support the transportation and storage ( midstream ) of new ( greenfield ) oil and gas reserves.All underwriters on both the property and casualty and the life and health reinsurance side have taken a mandatory train-ing programme in ESG issues in the form of Web-based train-ing . All property and casualty underwriters additionally com-pleted supplementary focus training covering topics such as ESG opportunities and risks , regulatory fundamentals , cli-mate change and biodiversity and attended subsequent , specifically designed workshops.Hannover Re joined the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance ( NZIA ) in 2021.Hannover Re became a signatory to the UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance ( UN PSI ) in 2021.InvestmentsESG criteria are similarly applied to the assets under our own management . These are defined in writing in an internal Responsible Investment Policy , application of which is ensured by an ESG officer on the investment team.In its investing activities Hannover Re similarly works to con-sistently reduce its carbon footprint . The focus here is on pro-gressive decarbonisation of the asset portfolio . We are doing this , in the first place , by reducing the carbon footprint ( Scope 1 and 2 ) of the investments under own management from the areas of corporate bonds , covered bonds and equities by 30 % by the year 2025 compared to the base year of 2019 . Our decarbonisation efforts are guided by an external \u201c car-bon risk rating \u201d that gives us , among other things , an exten-sive overview of our investment portfolio \u2019 s carbon footprint.As a further step , since as far back as 2012 , fixed-income se-curities ( government and semi-government bonds , corporate bonds and covered bonds ( with the exception of collateral-ised debt obligations ( CDO ) ) ) and listed equities within the portfolio of assets under own management have been subject to half-yearly negative screening , which now takes place on an ongoing and even ad hoc basis . Only a few niche funds or asset classes , such as real estate , private equity or structured investments , can not be analysed using this system . Similarly , before any new investments are made corresponding screen-ing is carried out with an eye to existing ESG criteria . Issuers who do not satisfy our criteria are actively scaled back.With an eye to environmental concerns , Hannover Re applies specific exclusion criteria to issuers that generate 25 % or more of their revenues from the mining of or power genera-tion from thermal coal or from oil sands extraction . We simi-larly exclude companies that generate 10 % or more of their revenues from offshore extraction of oil and gas in the polar region within the Arctic Circle ( 66\u00b0 34 \u2019 N ) .In addition to application of the aforementioned exclusion criteria , the focus has increasingly turned to the best-in-class approach in place since 2019 . This facilitates ongoing monitoring of the existing portfolio \u2019 s sustainability quality and is used in the implementation of specific ESG portfolio measures . Hannover Re | Annual Report 202266sustainable development in the core business , a company \u2019 s reputation , culture and work atmosphere , compatibility of work and family life , the availability of development and ca-reer opportunities and other additional benefits \u2013 summed up as the \u201c total rewards \u201d . At the same time , existing trends such as mobile working and virtual / hybrid meetings gained added impetus.Employees are part of a company and part of social structures outside that company . All measures taken strengthen Han-nover Re \u2019 s position on the labour market while at the same time having external implications . For this reason , we have chosen not to consider the impacts separately below.Impacts on our operations and impacts of our operationsAs a service provider in the insurance industry , Hannover Re operates in a highly specialised environment and at the same time finds itself faced with the framework conditions de-scribed above . A risk exists , for example , if vacancies can not be filled quickly enough or candidates of the necessary qual-ity can not be appointed . At the same time , companies benefit directly from motivated , dedicated and high-performing employees.A Talent Management initiative sponsored by the Chief Exec-utive Officer was launched in 2020 . The goal is to attract tal-ented new people to the company and retain them along with talent already existing in our ranks , to optimally deploy , foster and develop them at all locations and to create a work envi-ronment that makes Hannover Re the employer of choice . In addition , the initiative envisages measures to promote global mobility , the optimisation of relevant processes and systems as well as a greater interlinking of worldwide human resourc-es activities . The initiative covers the following aspects : \u2022 building a Group-wide , supportive human resources IT system , \u2022 promoting a global network within the human resourc-es community , \u2022 improved succession planning , \u2022 expanding measures relating to \u201c Learning & Develop-ment \u201d , especially leadership development , and\u2022 realising a Diversity , Equity & Inclusion ( DE & I ) strategy and implementing a roadmap with corresponding measures.For information on operational risks that can arise in connec-tion with or independently of the activities of the workforce , the reader is referred to the \u201c Opportunity and risk report \u201d .For information about the requirements placed on the spe-cialist qualifications and personal reliability ( fit & proper crite-ria ) of persons in key positions , we would refer to the Solven-cy and Financial Condition Report of Hannover R\u00fcck SE 2021 from page 31 onwards.Hannover Re employed 3,519 members of staff ( previous year : 3,346 ) Group-wide at the reference date of 31 Decem-ber 2022.Development opportunitiesHannover Re operates in a knowledge-intensive industry with a high level of specialisation . Continuous and appropriate ( further ) training of employees serves to assure the high qual-ity standard of services and a positive perception of the com-pany . At the same time , the programme of further training enables employees to continue their personal growth and it promotes life-long learning . In support of our approach to tal-ent management , our goal is to align ongoing training activi-ties more closely with the values , competencies and leader-ship fundamentals and to extend reporting to additional locations . The global leadership development programme \u201c LEAD \u201d launched in 2021 was expanded to the team leader-ship level in the year under review . A global assignment poli-cy was also approved back in 2021 and the internal job mar-ket was expanded to all locations around the world . Both took effect in the year under review and created transparency around the internal filling of positions on the global level.Health and wellnessThe performance capability and health of our employees are essential prerequisites for sustainable development of our business . Given that they work for a service provider , our staff members do not engage in activities that expose them to par-ticularly high risk . Nevertheless , the transformation in the world of work , the need for efficiently structured work pro-cesses and a constant pressure for change can lead to re-duced productivity and physical and / or psychological disor-ders \u2013 and hence to direct economic impacts on the company as well as social implications for the employees concerned , their private sphere , their colleagues and the social welfare systems.With a view to protecting the health of the workforce , the applicable employment protection legislation as well as re-quirements relating to ergonomic workplace design are sys-tematically observed and reviewed worldwide . Particularly close attention was paid to this issue in connection with the redesign of workplaces as part of \u201c New Ways of Working \u201d . Instruction in health and safety at the workplace is provided regularly . In addition , wellness among staff is actively encour-aged through health promotion measures ; these are in place worldwide , but are tailored to local needs in each case . 67Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022 Combined management reportDiversity and equal opportunitiesSupporting fair working conditions as well as a healthy and non-discriminatory working environment is part of Hannover Re \u2019 s corporate culture . The Executive Board recognised the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organi-zation ( ILO ) for 100 % of the workforce in the year under review . Hannover Re does not tolerate discrimination or bullying in any form whatsoever and has enshrined this in a company-wide Code of Conduct . Furthermore , the right to form employee representative bodies and to engage in collec-tive bargaining negotiations over working conditions is recognised ; employees are neither advantaged not disadvan-taged on account of their membership of a trade union or employee representative body.Hannover Re and its Executive Board are committed to equal opportunities in relation to diversity criteria and on all hierar-chical levels . A current focus of the measures is on support-ing women in leadership positions . Of the 163 senior execu-tives around the world , 36 are women ; this is equivalent to a proportion of 22.1 % . Our goal is to increase diversity on all levels of management worldwide . For the two levels of man-agement below the Executive Board explicit targets have also been defined for this purpose , details of which can be found in the Declaration on Corporate Governance.As part of the Talent Management initiative , a DE & I strategy was developed in 2021 that builds on our self-image and our values . We aim to \u201c create opportunities together \u201d while also being \u201c somewhat different \u201d . Along with the DE & I strategy , we have drawn up an action plan with nine new focus areas for 2022 . In the year under review , for example , we expanded the women \u2019 s network \u2018 Women @ Hannover Re \u2019 , made further progress in closing the gender pay gap and modified recruit-ment processes with an eye towards diversity . With a view to counteracting issues of \u201c unconscious bias \u201d , in other words unconscious prejudices or thought patterns that influence everyday behaviour and can have potentially negative effects in daily working life , awareness-raising workshops were con-ducted in the year under review , especially in the context of the LEAD leadership programme . Techniques for more objec-tive decision-making are also integrated.Compatibility of the professional and private sphere is closely correlated with issues of diversity and equal opportunities . The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated certain develop-ments in the world of work that had already begun in prior years . These include , for example , greater combination of an office workspace with remote working as well as flexible working time models tailored to the employee \u2019 s situation . These changes are increasingly becoming an integral compo-nent of a state-of-the-art , agile working environment and en-hance the company \u2019 s attractiveness on the labour market as well as the satisfaction , loyalty and performance readiness of the workforce.OpportunitiesWe link all measures to the possibility of recruiting , retaining and optimally fostering the best employees on the market.Employee matters : Selected goalsM 42 GoalTarget indicator by 2023Status 31.12.2022Recruiting , identifying , developing and retaining performance-driven employees according to requirements Conceptual design and further refinement of powerful branding and recruitment systemsOn targetCultivating and developing global mobility Adoption of a Global Assignment Policy ( GAP ) AchievedSupporting the lifelong learning of employees around the worldAlignment of our ( ongoing ) training activities with the values and core competencies of Hannover Re and expanded reporting on the worldwide pro-gramme of continuing training On targetIdentifying and fostering high-potentials and assuring successors for key positionsOptimisation of Group-wide talent reviews with a focus on development planning AchievedPromoting the health and performance of employees around the world Expansion of programmes to promote health and wellness by at least 10 % Under observationIncreasing diversity on all managerial levels , especially in relation to womenGender-neutral new appointments / replacements ( 50 / 50 ) for all vacant leadership positions on all managerial levels worldwideAchievedEnhancing equal opportunities through measures to support the compatibility of career and familyWorldwide programme of mobile workingAchieved Hannover Re | Annual Report 202270EmployeesIn view of the fact that our employees are highly skilled work-ers and we attach the utmost priority to compliance with ap-plicable national , collective bargaining and company regula-tions , we do not see any risk of serious violations of human rights . That said , issues such as discrimination , equal oppor-tunities and oppression require constant attention and moni-toring . We manage these issues in the context of our human resources management structure . For further information the reader is referred to the remarks in connection with the as-pect \u201c Employee matters \u201d . We protect employee data through rigorous compliance with statutory data protection require-ments.SuppliersHannover Re does not have a traditional upstream or down-stream supply chain of raw and auxiliary materials or pro-duced goods as is the case with , for example , manufacturing companies . Nevertheless , we too source a broad range of goods and services . Hannover Re has adopted its own Code of Conduct for Suppliers . This encompasses compliance with legal and ethical provisions , respect for human rights includ-ing observance of the core labour standards of the Interna-tional Labour Organization ( ILO ) and adherence to all appli-cable requirements in the areas of health , safety and environmental protection.As far as human rights due diligence is concerned , we see the greatest risk in connection with the procurement of IT hard-ware . For this reason , we have adopted an IT Procurement Guideline that is valid Group-wide and contains consistent rules governing the purchasing of IT products throughout the organisation . All bottleneck , leverage and strategic suppliers are subject to monitoring . Recognition of the Code of Con-duct for Suppliers or submission of the supplier \u2019 s own more extensive code of conduct is mandatory . As of 31 December 2022 100 % of core IT suppliers have committed to comply with the Code of Conduct for Suppliers or equivalent rules.Insurance businessWith regard to our activities in insurance business , we would refer the reader to the remarks made in connection with the aspect \u201c Environmental matters \u201d . Based on our risk analysis , we identified the greatest risk of potentially detrimental im-pacts on human rights in the following , particularly exposed areas : large construction projects ( including dams , oil and gas projects , mines and pipelines ) , mining operations as well as companies connected with internationally banned weap-ons . The facultative division \u2019 s ESG manual provides for a screening process to identify and decline transactions that entail an inherent risk of severe breaches of fundamental hu-man rights.All underwriters on both the property and casualty and the life and health reinsurance side have taken a mandatory train-ing programme in ESG issues in the form of Web-based train-ing . All property and casualty underwriters additionally com-pleted supplementary focus training covering topics such as human rights and attended subsequent , specifically designed workshops.InvestmentsAs far as our activities relating to assets under own manage-ment are concerned , we would refer the reader to the remarks made in connection with the aspect \u201c Environmental matters \u201d and the negative screening process described there . This is based inter alia on the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact ( UNGC ) ; six of these Principles explicitly ad-dress the issues of human rights and labour standards . Our investment guidelines also exclude issuers involved in the development and proliferation of internationally banned weapons.OpportunitiesWe do not see any particular opportunities in connection with this non-financial aspect.Respect for human rights : Selected goalsM 44 GoalTarget indicator by 2023Status 31.12.2022Living up to duties of care in matters of human rightsDefinition of measures in conformity with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Cross-cutting goal , ongoing 71Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022 Combined management reportFighting corruption and briberyCorruption , as the abuse of entrusted power for personal gain , has numerous negative repercussions . On the political and administrative level , corruption influences decision-mak-ing and the execution of approved measures in favour of indi-viduals or parts of the population . This erodes trust in the state and can become a threat to state legitimacy as well as to democratic institutions . On the economic level , corruption distorts competition and causes business transactions to be-come more expensive while preventing the efficient use of resources . The fight against corruption and bribery forms part of our compliance management system.Impacts on our operationsCompliance risks may become relevant in connection with the non-financial aspect \u201c Fighting corruption and bribery \u201d . At the same time , integrity and lawful conduct are directly correlated with a company \u2019 s reputation and establish the ba-sis for the trust placed in such company by business partners , investors , shareholders and the broader public and hence also the foundation for its success and competitiveness over the long term . In view of the business operations and imple-mented structures , no direct and / or severe risks were identi-fied . For further information the reader is referred to the \u201c Op-portunity and risk report \u201d in the combined Group management report.Impacts of our operationsGovernance and complianceAny form of unlawful or corrupt behaviour inflicts considera-ble harm on society and impedes free and fair competition . Companies in the financial sector have an important role to play when it comes to prevention and execution . Hannover Re has a sophisticated governance and compliance manage-ment system and adopts the \u201c three lines of defence \u201d ap-proach . For details of the implemented structures please see the \u201c Opportunity and risk report \u201d in the combined Group management report.Code of ConductHannover Re has adopted a company-wide Code of Conduct that is publicly accessible on the website . This was complete-ly revised in the year under review and approved by the Exec-utive Board and Supervisory Board.The Code of Conduct contains directions for our employees on appropriate behaviour with respect to all topics covered by our compliance management system . Hannover Re does not tolerate active or passive bribery or corruption and we do not participate in transactions with a criminal background . We act with caution in relation to gifts and invitations and make business decisions solely on the basis of solid , objective crite-ria . Our Code of Conduct further addresses issues around conflicts of interest.As a listed company , we make our employees aware at the start of their employment and subsequently at regular inter-vals of the need to observe rules on insider trading and , as warranted , to respect blocking periods for share trading.OpportunitiesNo particular opportunities are identified in connection with this non-financial aspect.Fighting corruption and bribary : Selected goalsM 45 GoalTarget indicator by 2023Status 31.12.2022Ensuring that the organisation is compliantAverage compliance score corresponding at a minimum to the targeted maturity level Ongoing Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022102Other risksUnder other risks we include emerging risks , strategic risks , sustainability and reputational risks as well as liquidity risks.Management of other risksOther risks are managed primarily using qualitative methods and on the basis of risk indicators . Risk management moni-tors and reduces the other risks through mitigation measures such as company-wide working groups and guidelines . Regu-lar quarterly risk reporting to the Risk Committee and the Ex-ecutive Board takes place with regard to the other risks . Risks are also evaluated as part of the reporting.Within the risk management processes we also take into ac-count the impacts on operational and reputational risks of aspects of environmental management , employee matters , social concerns , respect for human rights and the combating of corruption and bribery , as required by the CSR Directive Implementation Act in accordance with \u00a7 289b and c German Commercial Code ( HGB ) and \u00a7 315c German Commercial Code ( HGB ) .Emerging risksEmerging risks are risks that are in the process of forming or may shortly become relevant due to current developments . Emerging risks evolve gradually from weak signals to unmis-takable tendencies . They can directly impact our treaty port-folio in both property & casualty and life & health reinsurance and influence our investments . A further hallmark is that their risk content can not be reliably assessed , especially with re-spect to our treaty portfolio.Early detection and subsequent evaluation of risks are cru-cially important when it comes to emerging risks . For this reason , we deploy Hannover Re \u2019 s internal , interdepartmental and multi-line expert working group on \u201c Emerging Risks & Scientific Affairs \u201d and we ensure its linkage to risk manage-ment . The analyses performed by this working group are used Group-wide in order to initiate any necessary measures . The working group is currently exploring around 20 meg-atrends so as facilitate the identification and adequate evalu-ation of not only existing but also emerging risks . Megatrends are defined as developments with a trend cycle of at least 30 years . They are not presently associated with direct im-pacts on operations , but may potentially evolve in this direc-tion . Megatrends are considered in connection with emerg-ing risks and resulting opportunities . Thus , for example , the megatrend towards a decline in biodiversity can be viewed in conjunction with emerging risks associated with scarcity of resources , air pollution , genetically modified organisms or food security and availability \u2013 but also goes hand-in-hand with a need for innovative ( insurance ) solutions and services . Action on climate change means new or refined technologies , such as renewable energies or hydrogen concepts and their various possible applications , for which insurance coverages are needed.Another observed trend is urbanisation . The steady increase in urbanisation means the growth and change of cities . Those leaving the countryside and moving to the city are mostly young , hence altering both rural and urban age distributions . Correlated trends such as the ageing society and new types of mobility , increasingly against a backdrop of sustainability , are throwing up major questions . The significance of these trends and the speed of change are compelling the insurance indus-try to plan which role it wants to play in helping to shape the future . In this context it is important to consider both busi-ness opportunities and risks . Given that all this is affected by climate change , people \u2019 s property \u2013 especially when value concentrations form in future megacities \u2013 will have to be in-sured against natural perils . In a worst-case scenario , this could mean that certain regions and risks become uninsura-ble if adequate urban planning \u2013 taking account of natural hazards \u2013 is neglected in the spread of large cities around the world . Urbanisation not only means new buildings , technolo-gies and lifestyles that have to be insured ; rather , living close together also has implications for people \u2019 s physical and men-tal well-being , which is relevant to our portfolio of life and health insurance.Hannover Re publishes summary position papers on various emerging risks which can be accessed on our website . In the year under review the papers on supply chain risks , techno-logical risks , fracking , pollution and the risk posed by terror-ism , among others , were updated.Hannover Re , represented by members of staff from Risk Management and other units , is a member of the Chief Risk Officer ( CRO ) Forum and a constant participant in the CRO Forum \u2019 s Emerging Risk Initiative , which continuously tracks and analyses various emerging risks , publishes information on megatrends and associated risks and conducts corre-sponding impact analyses . The megatrends considered in-clude \u201c Ageing and health \u201d , \u201c Economic instability \u201d , \u201c Environ-ment and climate \u201d . \u201c ESG issues \u201d , \u201c Changes in the geopolitical landscape \u201d , \u201c Technological developments and their influence on society \u201d as well as \u201c Demographic and social change \u201d . New topics added in the year under review were \u201c Climate engineering \u201d and \u201c Space risk associated with a low earth or-bit \u201d . Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022274At its meeting on 8 March 2022 the Supervisory Board dis-cussed in detail the audited annual and consolidated financial statements as well as the Executive Board \u2019 s proposal for the appropriation of the disposable profit for the 2021 financial year . In this regard , as in the previous year , the Executive Board described all material indicators from the technical and non-technical accounts as well as key data on the investment side . The independent auditors presented the results of the audit and elaborated on the audit procedure . The assurance report on the non-financial information statement was also discussed . The Executive Board outlined the prospects for the current 2022 financial year , with particular attention fo-cused on the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the initial as-sessment of the resulting impacts . The insights gained from the important renewals in property and casualty reinsurance as at 1 January 2022 were also described , providing us with a good impression of the development of market conditions and Hannover Re \u2019 s positioning . We also exchanged views with the Executive Board on the current strategy cycle 2021\u20132023 and the status of target achievement . We discussed the major findings from the compliance , audit and risk reports . The respective function holders of the key functions were available to answer questions for this purpose . We adopted a resolution on the annual revision of the investment guide-lines , in which regard no significant change to the general investment strategy was proposed . Additionally , the variable remuneration of the members of the Executive Board was de-fined on the basis of the findings with respect to attainment of the respective individual targets for the 2021 financial year . In this context , as usual , we factored the findings of external remuneration surveys into our deliberations for the purpose of making a market comparison . In preparation for the Annu-al General Meeting on 4 May 2022 the agenda was discussed and approved , and in view of the protracted uncertainties connected with the pandemic we opted to hold the General Meeting virtually with no in-person attendance . In terms of content , the remuneration report for the Executive Board was to be submitted to the General Meeting for approval pursuant to \u00a7 120 a Para . 4 Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) . Details of the remuneration systems can be found in the Declaration on Corporate Governance on pages 107 et seq . and the remuner-ation report for 2022 on pages 114 et seq . At the recommen-dation of the Finance and Audit Committee , we proposed to the General Meeting that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft should again be commis-sioned and mandated to conduct the audit of the annual fi-nancial statements . After extensive deliberations we also de-cided that with effect from 1 April 2022 Dr. Lipowsky should take over the chair of the existing Finance and Audit Commit-tee after some years under the leadership of Mr. Haas . Given that , with Dr. Lipowsky , the chair of the committee is now held by a member of the Supervisory Board deemed inde-pendent under the German Corporate Governance Code from 1 April 2022 onwards , we updated the Declaration of Con-formity with the Code at this date.At the meeting held on 3 May 2022 the Executive Board re-ported on the first quarter of 2022 . We explored the overall results of the previous year in greater depth , with the quality and adequacy of the loss reserves in property and casualty reinsurance considered in detail . Both internal and external experts were available to answer our questions in this regard . In addition to the outlook for the current financial year , which continued to be shaped by the war in Ukraine and resulting economic effects , the examination of the Own Risk and Sol-vency Assessment ( ORSA ) report on the previous year and the capitalisation under Solvency II constituted further key points of deliberation . Following up on this , the structure of the Reg-ular Supervisory Report ( RSR ) and its differences and over-laps relative to the ORSA report were explained . We also re-ceived the audit report on the Solvency II balance sheet . A capital measure to be adopted within the Group was another focus of discussions . In conformity with \u00a7 111 Para . 5 Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) , the targets for women on the Execu-tive Board and Supervisory Board were explored and defined . The current values can be found in the Declaration on Corpo-rate Governance on page 107 et seq . Furthermore , we used the meeting as an opportunity to have the updated Code of Conduct presented to us . The Code of Conduct has now been published on the company \u2019 s website ( https : //www.han-nover-re.com/50943/code-of-conduct.pdf ) . With regard to the annually conducted self-assessment of the Supervisory Board \u2019 s areas of expertise , the Supervisory Board decided that in 2023 the current list of topics \u2013 which already goes beyond the regulatory requirements \u2013 will be expanded to in-clude the important areas of \u201c ESG ( Environmental , Social , Governance ) \u201d , \u201c auditing of financial statements \u201d and \u201c digi-talisation \u201d .On 3 August 2022 , in a meeting that lasted the entire day , the Executive Board reported on the first half of 2022 , describing as usual key performance indicators from the underwriting and non-underwriting side and outlining the progress made in attaining the strategic targets . The potential repercussions of the war in Ukraine remained a primary focus . We discussed the major insights from the risk report and the Chief Risk Of-ficer presented at our request the internal cyber exposure management , including the report on Realistic Disaster Sce-narios . Another key topic at the meeting was the discussion of and reporting on the status of implementation of the current IT strategy . Based on a separate item of the reporting , we also looked at the strategy of the property and casualty reinsur-ance segment in the United States . Furthermore , an account of related party transactions was routinely provided . It was concluded that there were no transactions in the reporting period that fall under the legal requirements governing man-datory approval ( \u00a7 111b Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) ) or compulsory disclosure ( \u00a7 111c Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) ) . Within the subject area of corporate governance we explored the recommendations set out in the German Corporate Gov-ernance Code , which was revised in the year under review . 275Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022 Supervisory BoardWe were again provided with reports on the latest develop-ments in sustainability and the company \u2019 s measures and ac-tion fields . We shall engage in a regular dialogue about ESG topics , especially those of a strategic nature , in the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and have therefore nominated Dr. Andrea Pollak from among our own ranks as an expert in matters of ESG and sustainability.On 30 August 2022 all the members of the Supervisory Board came together for a special meeting dedicated exclusively to the functioning and internal implementation of the new ac-counting regime ( IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 ) . Extensive training ma-terials with illustrative examples had been prepared for the Supervisory Board for this purpose.At the last meeting of the year held on 2 November 2022 , we deliberated at length on the key preliminary results in the business performance and the outlook for the current finan-cial year . The above-average large loss expenditure in 2022 , which again confronted the entire industry with exceptional challenges in the year under review , was our primary focus . In addition , we discussed with the Executive Board the im-pacts of inflation and the protracted war in Ukraine . The Ex-ecutive Board also presented to us the operational planning for 2023 , which we considered in detail and subsequently approved . We discussed the latest insights from the risk re-port , including a special report on climate risks , and were informed of the status of major pending legal proceedings . The Executive Board provided routine reporting on employee capacities and the elaboration of the remuneration system for senior executives pursuant to \u00a7 3 Para . 5 of the Regulation on the Supervisory Law Requirements for Remuneration Schemes in the Insurance Sector ( VersVergV ) . At this meet-ing we also adopted the resolution on issuance of subordinat-ed debt . The bond was successfully issued on 14 November 2022 in the planned volume and with a coupon of 5.875 % p. a . ( https : //www.hannover-re.com/1914419/bonds ) . Fur-thermore , the Supervisory Board explored the possible con-tribution of part of the company \u2019 s private equity portfolio to a joint venture.A significant part of the meeting was also devoted to corpo-rate governance matters . Based on the findings of the \u201c Fit and Proper \u201d self-assessment that had been conducted among the Supervisory Board members , the Supervisory Board en-gaged in an extensive exchange of views on a development plan for the entire Supervisory Board . It was again the case this year that the individual members of the Supervisory Board attended advanced training measures in relation to various core topics ; the costs incurred in this connection were paid by the company . Topics covered in 2022 included IFRS and ESG . We also approved the Supervisory Board \u2019 s current competency profile in the form of a skills matrix . This is published as part of the Declaration on Corporate Govern-ance ( page 113 ) . In addition , we nominated Dr. Lipowsky and Mr. Haas as \u201c financial experts \u201d in accordance with \u00a7100 Para . 5 Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) , with Dr. Lipowsky hav-ing the necessary expertise particularly in accounting mat-ters and Mr. Haas in particular when it comes to the auditing of financial statements . With these further advances in corpo-rate governance , we were then able to join the Executive Board in issuing an unqualified Declaration of Conformity pursuant to \u00a7 161 Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) regarding compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code . We also discussed and approved as the full Supervisory Board the individual targets for the members of the Executive Board for 2023 . The focus here was on the findings of the Organisa-tional Health Check , sustainability and the strategic objec-tives.As in every year , we were regularly briefed on the work of the Supervisory Board committees.Committees of the Supervisory BoardOf the committees formed by the Supervisory Board within the meaning of \u00a7 107 Para . 3 Stock Corporation Act ( AktG ) , the Finance and Audit Committee met on four occasions and the Standing Committee met three times in 2022 . The com-mittee chairs updated the full Supervisory Board on the major deliberations of the committee meetings at its next meeting and provided an opportunity for further questions . In the case of activities conducted by the committees preparatory to adoption of a resolution , we have consistently taken care to ensure that the full Supervisory Board remains extensively informed in order to fulfil its duties of due diligence.The Finance and Audit Committee considered inter alia the consolidated financial statement and the quarterly reports drawn up in accordance with IFRS and the annual financial statement of Hannover R\u00fcck SE drawn up in accordance with the German Commercial Code ( HGB ) , and it discussed with the independent auditors their reports on these financial statements . As in the previous years , an expert opinion on the adequacy of the loss reserves in property and casualty rein-surance was noted , the retrocession structure of the Han-nover Re Group as well as reports of the key functions were received and considered . In addition , the Committee exam-ined the investment structure and investment income \u2013 in-cluding the stress tests with regard to the investments and their implications for net income and the equity base . The review of the quality of the auditing was carried out using the system put in place in previous years . In one meeting the Committee focused on the development of the company \u2019 s ma-jor equity participations . The important topic of ESG/sustain-ability was also discussed by the Committee on multiple occa-sions , including in connection with the current reporting framework . The Committee again opted for an external audit of the non-financial information statement 2022 and commis-sioned PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs-gesellschaft to conduct this . The implementation of the new Hannover Re | Annual Report 2022276financial reporting standard ( IFRS 17 ) was another point of emphasis in the Committee \u2019 s deliberations in the financial year . On 31 August 2022 the Committee came together for additional , more in-depth training following the meeting of the full Supervisory Board . At each meeting the Chief Risk Officer gave an account of the latest developments in risk management and answered questions about the risk report . We were able to discuss special topics , such as climate change , with him . The Committee also explored further mat-ters relating to the internal control system . In addition , the Committee regularly engaged with the latest developments in the run-off of losses and exchanged views on this with the Executive Board . The Committee defined the audit concentra-tions for the auditing of the annual accounts for the financial year and considered at length the audit plan and the audit approach for the auditing of the annual financial statements . It explored the evaluation of the audit risk and the resulting audit scope with the auditors of the annual financial state-ments . The Finance and Audit Committee also maintained a dialogue with the auditors independently of the Executive Board.As in the previous years , the Standing Committee reviewed the adequacy of the remuneration system for the members of the Executive Board , determined the variable remuneration of the members of the Executive Board for the 2021 financial year based on the findings pertaining to attainment of their respective targets and examined the remuneration for the Board members who were due for review , among other things . With regard to all these matters the Committee drew up corresponding recommendations for the full Supervisory Board . In the context of the extensions of the terms of office for individual members of the Executive Board that were up for discussion in 2022 , we engaged in an ongoing dialogue on medium- and long-term succession arrangements . The Committee further addressed the enlargement of the Execu-tive Board from seven to eight members and the preparations for appointment of the new member of the Executive Board . Furthermore , the individual targets of the members of the Ex-ecutive Board for 2023 were defined on the basis of the up-dated remuneration system and prepared for adoption of a resolution by the full Supervisory Board.The Nomination Committee was not convened in 2022.Audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statementsThe accounting , annual financial statements , consolidated fi-nancial statements and the combined management report were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschafts- pr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft . The auditor was chosen by the General Meeting following the recommendation of the Supervisory Board ; the Chairman of the Supervisory Board awarded the audit mandate . The auditor \u2019 s independence declaration was received . Along with the audit concentrations defined by the European Securities and Markets Authority and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority , auditing activities relating to the implementation of IFRS 17 were also included in the scope of the audit . The mandate for the review report by the independent auditors on the Half-yearly Financial Report and the audit of the Solvency II balance sheet was also awarded again . The special challenges associated with the internation-al aspects of the audits were met without reservation . Since the audits did not give rise to any objections , Pricewater-houseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft issued unqualified audit certificates . It was also determined that the annual financial statement contains the information pursuant to \u00a7 289f German Commercial Code ( HGB ) . The Finance and Audit Committee discussed the financial statements and the combined management report with the participation of the auditors and in light of the audit reports , and it informed the Supervisory Board of the outcome of its reviews .

HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 18THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR As Chair of the Supervisory Board , I also held several talks with investors on issues relating specifically to the Supervisory Board and on questions of corporate governance . I reported on these talks in summary form to the Supervisory Board . There were no indications of conflicts of interest involving Management Board or Supervisory Board members that might have required immediate disclosure to the Supervisory Board and reporting to the Annual General Meeting . Members of the Supervisory Board take it upon themselves to seek the training needed to perform their duties ; these efforts are appropriately supported by the corporation . The corporation again offered information and training events focusing on specific topics in the year under review . They included , for example , a presentation of the regulatory framework for managing and reporting on ESG issues and their significance for the capital market . Supervisory Board meetings The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee held four regular meetings in the reporting year . Some members attended the meetings in person ; others took part by video conference . A further extraordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board was held by video conference . The members of the Management Board participated in the meetings of the Supervisory Board unless it was deemed expedient for the Supervisory Board to discuss individual agenda items without the Management Board being present . Discussions were also possible without the Management Board . In each of our meetings , we discussed the reports submitted by the Management Board , conferring with it on the development of the corporation and on strategic issues . We also discussed the overall economic situation and Henkel \u2019 s business performance . After the start of war in Ukraine , we regularly discussed both the associated actions taken to protect our employees and the impacts of the war on Henkel .

Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke , who chaired the Audit Committee in the year under review , and Simone Menne both comply with the statutory requirements for Audit Committee membership of impartiality and expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing . For more details on the responsibilities and composition of the committees , please refer to the corporate governance statement ( on pages 51 to 85 ) and the membership lists on page 345 of this Annual Report . Committee activities Following the appointment of the external auditor by the 2022 Annual General Meeting , it was mandated by the Audit Committee to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements , including the combined management report for Henkel AG & Co. KGaA and the Group , and to review the half-year financial report for fiscal 2022 . The audit fee was also established and the key audit matters were discussed . It was agreed that the auditor will notify the Supervisory Board immediately of any findings or incidents discovered or occurring during the audit that are material to the performance of the Supervisory Board \u2019 s duties . Appropriate procedures for the provision of non-audit-related services as permitted in the relevant EU regulations were specified . The Audit Committee also obtained the necessary validation of auditor independence for the performance of these tasks . The Audit Committee likewise commissioned the external auditor to review the content both of the separate , combined non-financial statement for Henkel AG & Co. KGaA and the Group , which is compiled as a separate non-financial report , and of the remuneration report compiled in accordance with Section 162 of the stock corporation act [ AktG ] . Both reports will be made available in the public domain through publication on our website . The four meetings held by the Audit Committee in the year under review were a mixture of personal attendance and video conferences . In the run-up to each meeting , the Chair of the Audit Committee held confidential talks with the auditors regarding the audit findings and any other aspects of audit relevance . The meetings and resolutions were prepared through the provision of reports and other information by the Management Board . The heads of the relevant Group functions \u2013 particularly Corporate Accounting , Legal & Compliance , Treasury and Internal Auditing \u2013 also reported on individual agenda items and were available to answer questions .

There were no objections raised in response to these reports . The Audit Committee likewise focused in great detail on the accounting process and the efficacy and further development of the Group-wide internal control and risk management systems . The efficiency of the risk management system was reviewed on the basis of the risk reports of previous years . The report given by the General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer on material legal disputes and issues relating to compliance within the Group was also discussed , as was the status report submitted by Internal Audit .

Some improve-ment opportunities were discussed and are in the process of being implemented . The next efficiency audit is scheduled to take place in 2023/2024 . Corporate governance and declaration of compliance The Supervisory Board again dealt with questions of corporate governance in the reporting year . In our meet-ing on December 9 , 2022 , we examined the amendments to the German Corporate Governance Code ( GCGC ) . In particular , we discussed and revised the objectives governing supervisory board composition and approved the supervisory board qualifications matrix proposed by the GCGC . The rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee were revised and edited to reflect gender neutrality . Details of Henkel \u2019 s corporate governance can be found in the corporate governance statement ( pages 51 to 85 of this Annual Report ) , with which we fully acquiesce . At our meeting on February 28 , 2023 , we discussed and approved the joint declaration of compliance for 2023 to be submitted by the Management Board , Shareholders \u2019 Committee and Supervisory Board , as specified in the GCGC . The full wording of the current and previous declarations of compliance can be accessed through the company website . The current declaration of compliance is also reflected in the corporate governance statement . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 52THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR The rights and duties of the supervisory board of a KGaA are more limited compared to those of the super-visory board of an AG . Specifically , the supervisory board of a KGaA is not authorized to appoint personally liable partners , preside over the partners \u2019 contractual arrangements , impose procedural rules on the manage-ment board , or rule on business transactions . These duties are performed for the corporation by the Shareholders \u2019 Committee and by the Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG respectively . A KGaA is not required to appoint a director of labor affairs , even if , like Henkel , the company is bound to abide by Germany \u2019 s Codetermination Act of 1976 . The general meeting of a KGaA essentially has the same rights as the shareholders \u2019 meeting of an AG . For example , it votes on the appropriation of profit , elects members of the supervisory board ( shareholder representatives ) and formally approves the supervisory board \u2019 s actions . It appoints the auditor and also votes on amendments to the articles of association and measures that change the company \u2019 s capital , which are implemented by the management board . Additionally , as stipulated by the legal form , it also votes on the adoption of the annual financial statements of the company , formally approves the actions of the personally liable partner ( general partner ) , and elects and approves the actions of the members of the shareholders \u2019 committee as established under the articles of association . Resolutions passed in general meeting require the approval of the personally liable partner where they involve matters which , in the case of a limited partnership , require the authorization of the general partners and that of the limited partners ( Section 285 ( 2 ) AktG ) or relate to the adoption of annual financial statements ( Section 286 ( 1 ) AktG ) . According to our Articles of Association , in addition to the Supervisory Board , Henkel also has a standing Shareholders \u2019 Committee comprising a minimum of five and a maximum of ten members , all of whom are elected by the Annual General Meeting ( Art . 27 of the Articles of Association ) . The Shareholders \u2019 Committee is required in particular to perform the following functions ( Section 278 ( 2 ) AktG in conjunction with Sections 114 and 161 HGB , and Art . 8 , 9 and 26 of the Articles of Association ) : \u0083In particular , the Shareholders \u2019 Committee acts in place of the Annual General Meeting in guiding thebusiness activities of the corporation.\u0083It decides on the appointment and dismissal of the Personally Liable Partners.\u0083It holds both the power of representation and executive powers over the legal relationships prevailingbetween the corporation and Henkel Management AG , the Personally Liable Partner.\u0083It exercises the voting rights of the corporation in the Annual General Meeting of Henkel ManagementAG , thereby choosing its three-member Supervisory Board which , in turn , appoints and dismisses themembers of the Management Board.\u0083It determines the rules of procedure for Henkel Management AG , as the Personally Liable Partner , andspecifies which transactions it must submit to the Shareholders \u2019 Committee for approval . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 55THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Recommendations of the Code that refer to the duties and responsibilities of a supervisory board that are performed by the Shareholders \u2019 Committee in accordance with the Corporation \u2019 s bylaws are analogously applied to the Shareholders \u2019 Committee . \u0083The rights and duties of the supervisory board of a KGaA are more limited compared to those of thesupervisory board of an AG . In particular , the Supervisory Board of the Corporation has no authority toappoint personally liable partners or to preside over the associated contractual arrangements ; it may notissue rules of procedure governing the actions of the Management Board , and it is not permitted todesignate business transactions requiring oversight consent . These duties are performed by the Shareholders \u2019 Committee or the supervisory board of Henkel Management AG . A KGaA is not required to appoint adirector of labor affairs , even if , like Henkel , the company is bound to abide by Germany \u2019 s CodeterminationAct of 1976.\u0083The general meeting of a KGaA essentially has the same rights as the shareholders \u2019 meeting of an AG.In addition , it resolves on the adoption of the annual financial statements of the Corporation and formallyapproves the actions of the personally liable partner ( s ) . At Henkel , the General Meeting also elects theShareholders \u2019 Committee and formally approves its actions . Numerous resolutions passed in the GeneralMeeting require the consent of the personally liable partner , including approval of the annual financialstatements of the Corporation.Recommendations of the Code Where the Code offers recommendations concerning the duties and responsibilities of a supervisory board that are performed by the Corporation \u2019 s Shareholders \u2019 Committee or the supervisory board of Henkel Management AG due to legal form or in compliance with the Articles of Association , those recommendations have been adopted accordingly for the Shareholders \u2019 Committee and the supervisory board of Henkel Management AG respectively . Such recommendations contained in the GCGC relate to the composition of the Management Board , succession planning , the length of first terms in office , reappointments and specification of an age limit , definition of a remuneration system and of total remuneration , and specification of the amount of variable remuneration to be paid to the Management Board and of the monetary arrange-ments upon termination of a contract ( Recommendations B.1 to B.5 and G.1 to G.16 ) . Taking into account the special features arising from its legal form and bylaws , the Corporation complies with all recommendations ( \u201c shall \u201d provisions ) of the GCGC , with the following exceptions : \u0083According to Recommendation C.5 GCGC , management board members of listed companies should notaccept more than two supervisory board appointments or comparable offices in non-Group listed com-panies . Nor should they chair a supervisory board of a non-Group listed company . Whether the number of HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 56THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR mandates held by members of the management board remains appropriate is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis as a more reasonable approach , rather than by means of a rigid upper limit . \u0083According to Recommendation G.10 GCGC , the amounts corresponding to the variable components ofremuneration awarded to the members of the Management Board should be predominantly investedby them in Corporation shares , or be awarded in appropriately share-based form . Long-term variableremuneration awards to Management Board members should be subject to a four-year lock-up period.In derogation from this recommendation , the portion of the personal investment in Henkel preferred shares ( share deferral ) to be made under the Short Term Incentive scheme ( STI ) in relation to the at-targetremuneration ( target achievement , functional factor 1 ) amounts to around 25 percent of the total variableremuneration ( comprising the STI and the Long Term Incentive ( LTI ) ) and around 47 percent of the totallong-term remuneration ( comprising the share deferral and the LTI ) .The lock-up period for the Henkel preferred shares expires in each case on December 31 of the fourthcalendar year following the remuneration year . This share deferral ensures that the members of the Manage-ment Board accumulate and hold a significant share portfolio during the rolling lock-up period , and thatthey participate in the long-term performance of the Corporation , whether this be positive or negative.This share portfolio continues to grow due to the fact that shares are sold , if at all , only in exceptionalinstances once the respective lock-up period has expired.The performance measurement period for the LTI is three years . The LTI is paid in cash once the Corpora-tion \u2019 s annual financial statements for the final year in the performance measurement period have beenapproved by the General Meeting.In keeping with the objectives of the Management Board remuneration policy , this structure of the STIand LTI rewards sustainably profitable growth and thus supports the long-term development of Henkel ; and Management Board remuneration is aligned to the interests of the Corporation \u2019 s shareholders.\u0083The Corporation derogates from Recommendation G.12 GCGC \u2013 according to which , in the event oftermination of a Management Board contract , the payment of any outstanding variable remunerationcomponents attributable to the period up to termination of the contract should be in accordance with theoriginally agreed targets and comparison parameters and in accordance with the due dates or holdingperiods specified in the contract to the extent that , in the event of premature departure , the STI is calculatedon the basis of the budget figures and paid out in the last month . Upon termination and in the event ofdeath , all vesting periods arising from the personal investment in Henkel preferred shares ( share deferral ) cease to apply . Similarly , in the event of death , claims under the LTI in respect of tranches not yet disbursedare settled on the basis of the budget figures and paid to the heirs . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 59THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Our vision : \u0083 Win the 20s by outperforming the markets through innovative and sustainable solutions . Our values : \u0083 We put our customers and consumers at the center of what we do . \u0083 We value , challenge and reward our people . \u0083 We drive excellent sustainable financial performance . \u0083 We are committed to leadership in sustainability . \u0083 We shape our future with a strong entrepreneurial spirit based on our family business tradition . The corporate bodies of Henkel and our employees worldwide are guided by this purpose , this vision , and these values . They reaffirm our ambition to meet the highest ethical standards in everything we do . And they guide our employees in all the day-to-day decisions they make , providing a compass for their conduct and actions . Henkel is committed to ensuring that all business transactions are conducted in an ethically irreproachable , legal fashion . Consequently , Henkel expects all our employees not only to respect the corporation \u2019 s internal rules and all relevant laws , but also to avoid conflicts of interest , to protect Henkel \u2019 s assets and to respect the social values of the countries and cultural environments in which Henkel does business . The Manage-ment Board has therefore issued a series of Group-wide codes and standards with precepts that are binding worldwide . These regulatory instruments are not static , but are periodically reviewed and amended as appro-priate , evolving in step with the changing legal and commercial conditions that affect Henkel as a globally active corporation . The Code of Conduct supports our employees in ethical and legal issues . The Leadership Commitments define the principles of management conduct . The Code of Corporate Sustainability describes the principles that drive our sustainable , socially responsible approach to business . This code also enables Henkel to meet the commitments derived from the United Nations Global Compact . Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations is an integral component of our operating models and business processes . Henkel has established a Group-wide compliance organization with locally and regionally responsible compliance officers led by a globally responsible General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer ( CCO ) . The General Counsel & CCO , supported by the Corporate Compliance Office and the interdisciplinary Compliance & Risk Committee , manages and controls compliance-related activities undertaken at the corporate level , coordinates training courses , oversees fulfillment of both internal and external regulations , and takes appropriate action in the event of compliance violations . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 60THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR The local and regional compliance officers are responsible for organizing and overseeing the training activities and implementation measures tailored to the specific local and regional requirements . They report to the Corporate Compliance Office . The General Counsel & CCO reports regularly to the Management Board and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on identified compliance violations . The issue of compliance is also a permanent item in the target agreements signed by all managerial staff of Henkel . Due to their position , it is particularly incumbent on them to set the right example for their sub-ordinates , to effectively communicate the compliance rules and to ensure through the implementation of suitable organizational measures that these are obeyed . The procedures to be followed in the event of complaints or suspicion of malpractice also constitute an important element of the compliance policy . Since we place great importance on identifying potential mis-conduct and taking suitable action to prevent violations , all Henkel employees and stakeholders are required to report possible misconduct . In addition to our internal reporting system and complaint registration channels , a compliance hotline operated by an external service provider is available for the purpose of reporting sus-picions of violations \u2013 anonymously , if preferred \u2013 to the Corporate Compliance Office . The Head of the Corporate Compliance Office is mandated to initiate the necessary follow-up procedures . Our corporate compliance activities are focused on antitrust law and the fight against corruption . In our Code of Conduct , the corporate guidelines based upon it , and in other publications , the Management Board clearly expresses its rejection of all infringements of the principles of compliance , particularly antitrust violations and corruption . We do not tolerate such violations in any way . For Henkel , bribery , anticompetitive agree-ments , or any other violations of laws are no way to initiate or conduct business . A further compliance-relevant area relates to capital market law . Supplementing the legal provisions , internal codes of conduct have been put in place to regulate the treatment of issues and information that have the potential to materially affect share prices . The corporation has an Ad Hoc Committee comprised of represent-atives from various departments . In order to ensure that potential insider information is handled as required by law , this Committee reviews occurrences for their possible effect on share prices , determining the need to issue reports to the capital markets on an ad hoc basis . The ultimate authority to decide how to handle potential insider information lies with the Management Board . There are also rules that go beyond the legal requirements , governing the behavior of the members of the Management Board , the Supervisory Board and the Shareholders \u2019 Committee , and also employees of the corporation who , due to their function or involve-ment in projects , have access to potential insider information .

As of December 31 , 2022 , the Management Board had five members . The members of the Management Board are segregated from both the Supervisory Board and the Share-holders \u2019 Committee of Henkel AG & Co.

The Chair of the Management Board is responsible for coordinating all areas of Management Board responsibility . Further details relating to cooperation and the division of operational responsibilities within the Management Board are regulated by the rules of procedure issued by the Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 62THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR It is the duty of the Management Board to prepare the annual financial statements of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA , the consolidated financial statements and combined management reports for Henkel AG & Co. KGaA and the Group , the non-financial statements and the half-year financial reports and quarterly statements . Together with the Supervisory Board of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA , it compiles the annual remuneration report per Section 162 AktG . The Management Board is responsible for management of the overall business including planning , coor-dination , allocation of resources , and control/risk management . It must also ensure compliance with legal provisions , regulatory requirements and internal company guidelines , and take steps to ensure that Group companies also observe them . To this end , the Management Board has put a comprehensive compliance management system in place that also offers employees and third parties the option of reporting suspicions of relevant violations in the corporation without fear of retribution . From its examination of the internal control and risk management system and the reporting of the Internal Audit department , the Management Board is not aware of any circumstances that undermine the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems . The Management Board adopts its resolutions in meetings held at regular intervals or by written procedure . Decisions by the Management Board are taken on the basis of detailed information and analysis submitted by the business units and central functions and \u2013 to the extent deemed necessary \u2013 by external consultants . Wherever possible , Management Board resolutions are adopted unanimously . In the absence of a unanimous vote , the majority decides ; in the event of a tie , the Chair of the Management Board has the casting vote . If outvoted , the Chair has a veto right . Exercising the veto right prompts renewed debate of the resolution by the Management Board . If the veto right is exercised again in response to the proposed adoption of a reso-lution , the matter is forwarded to the Shareholders \u2019 Committee for a final decision . Any member of the Manage-ment Board can appeal to the Shareholders \u2019 Committee in respect of a matter affecting the corporation in which they were outvoted . Supervisory Board Composition , duties The corporation \u2019 s Supervisory Board is composed of equal numbers of shareholder and employee repre-sentatives as specified in the 1976 Codetermination Act [ MitbestG ] , and is made up of 16 members ( Section 7 ( 1 ) sentence 2 MitbestG in conjunction with Art . 12 ( 1 ) of the Articles of Association ) . The eight shareholder representatives are elected by the Annual General Meeting and the eight employee representatives by the workforce in keeping with the 1976 Codetermination Act and the relevant voting procedures . All members of the Supervisory Board are bound in equal measure to protect the interests of the corporation . Members HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 63THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR are appointed for five-year terms unless otherwise specified at election . At the last election of the share-holder representatives by the Annual General Meeting 2020 , their term of office was set at four years . It is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board to advise and supervise the Management Board in the per-formance of its business management duties . At regular intervals , the Supervisory Board discusses with the Management Board business policy , business performance and planning , the risk situation , risk management and the internal control system , as well as issues relating to compliance . It reviews the annual financial statements of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA and the Group \u2019 s consolidated financial statements together with the associated combined management reports and the non-financial statement , taking into account the reviews and audit reports submitted by the auditor . It also votes on the proposal of the Management Board regarding the appropriation of profit and submits to the Annual General Meeting a proposal for the appointment of the external auditor , based on the recommendation submitted by the Audit Committee . The Supervisory Board also compiles jointly with the Management Board the annual remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 AktG . Approving the annual financial statements is not the Supervisory Board \u2019 s duty , but rather the responsibility of the Annual General Meeting . As a general rule , the Supervisory Board meets four times per year . If deemed necessary , the Management Board does not participate in such meetings . The Supervisory Board reaches its decisions by a simple majority of the votes cast . In the event of a tie , the Chair has the casting vote . The Supervisory Board has established an Audit Committee and a Nominations Committee . The Audit Committee shall comprise three Supervisory Board members elected on the basis of names proposed by the Supervisory Board \u2019 s shareholder representatives , and three Supervisory Board members elected on the basis of names proposed by the Supervisory Board \u2019 s employee representatives . The Chair of the Audit Committee is elected based on a proposal of the shareholder representative members . As of December 31 , 2022 , the following were members of the Audit Committee : Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke ( Chair ) , Simone Menne ( Vice Chair ) and Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah as shareholder representatives , and Birgit Helten-Kindlein , Edgar Topsch and Michael Vassiliadis as employee representatives . It is a statutory requirement that the Audit Committee includes at least one member with expertise in the field of accounting and at least one further member with expertise in the field of auditing ; all members must be familiar with the sector in which the corporation operates ( Section 100 ( 5 ) and Section 107 ( 4 ) AktG ) . According to D.3 GCGC , the Chair of the Audit Committee should be knowledgeable in at least one of the two fields . Henkel \u2019 s Audit Committee meets these requirements . Among the shareholder representatives , Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke , current Chair of the Audit Committee , and Simone Menne have both spent many years working on management boards , as chief HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 67THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Onboarding In an onboarding procedure , newly elected members of the Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Committee are familiarized with our corporate values , applicable codes and standards , the basic organizational structure and strategy of the corporation together with the main corresponding initiatives , the corporation \u2019 s operational performance and other current issues of relevance , and members \u2019 rights and obligations , taking into account the special features arising from our legal form and Articles of Association . Further , members take it upon themselves to seek the training needed to perform their duties \u2013 for example in the event of changes in legal frameworks . These efforts are appropriately supported by the corporation . If the need arises , in-house information events provide specific upskilling . Interaction between Management Board , Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Committee The Management Board , Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Committee work in close cooperation for the benefit of the corporation . The Management Board agrees the strategic direction of the corporation with the Shareholders \u2019 Committee and discusses with it the status of strategy implementation at regular intervals . In keeping with the precepts of good corporate governance , the Management Board informs the Supervisory Board and the Shareholders \u2019 Committee regularly , and in a timely and comprehensive fashion , of all relevant issues concerning business policy , corporate planning , profitability , the business development of the corpo-ration and major affiliated companies , and also matters relating to risk exposure , risk management , and compliance . It also discusses the status of strategy implementation . During their tenure , members of the Management Board are subject to a comprehensive ban on competition . They are obligated to act in the interests of the corporation and must not be guided by personal interest when making decisions . In particular , they must not make personal use of business opportunities owing to the corporation . Any ancillary professional activities \u2013 particularly supervisory board mandates outside the Henkel Group \u2013 may only be accepted with the prior approval of the Supervisory Board of Henkel Manage-ment AG . The Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG decides whether and to what extent any compensation for ancillary activities is to be offset . All members of the Management Board must immediately notify the Chair of the Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG and their Management Board colleagues of any conflicts of interest . For transactions of fundamental significance , the Shareholders \u2019 Committee has established a right of veto in the procedural rules governing the actions of Henkel Management AG in its function as sole Personally Liable Partner ( Art . 26 of the Articles of Association ) . This covers , in particular , decisions or measures that materially HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 68THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR change the net assets , financial position or results of operations of the corporation . The Management Board complies with these rights of consent of the Shareholders \u2019 Committee and also duly submits to the decision authority of the corporation \u2019 s Annual General Meeting . Our vision and values , Code of Conduct , Code of Corporate Sustainability and other codes and policies governing our stewardship of the corporation are publicly accessible on our website www.henkel.com . Activities of the Supervisory Board and Shareholders \u2019 Committee in the year under review The activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees are described in the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting . The Shareholders \u2019 Committee continued to discharge its duties diligently in fiscal 2022 in accordance with the legal statutes and Articles of Association . In compliance with the Articles of Association , the Shareholders \u2019 Committee engaged in the management of the corporation and carefully and regularly monitored the work of the Management Board , advising and supporting it in its stewardship and in the strategic development of the corporation . It also discussed and ruled on those transactions that required its approval . Six scheduled meetings took place in the year under review , together with a conference with the Manage-ment Board of several days \u2019 duration . Likewise , the Personnel and Finance Committees each met six times . Some members attended the meetings ; others took part by video conference . In addition , five extraordinary meetings were held , three of which as a mixture of personal attendance and video conferences , and two as video conferences . The election of a new Vice Chair necessitated by changes in the Shareholders \u2019 Committee and the appointment of members to the Committees following the Annual General Meeting 2022 were implemented by written procedure . Participation in the meetings of the Shareholders \u2019 Committee and its subcommittees was 95.9 percent . For details of individual members \u2019 attendance at meetings , please refer to the remuneration report . At all ordinary meetings , the reports submitted by the Management Board were discussed , and the general development of the corporation , the status of acquisitions and divestments , and other matters of strategic importance were analyzed together with the Management Board . The overall economic situation and Henkel \u2019 s business performance were also discussed . Since the war in Ukraine started , a situational report in each case detailed the measures implemented to protect our employees in Ukraine and the impacts of the war on Henkel . Areas of particular focus included the new strategic alignment of the corporation and its imple-mentation status \u2013 particularly the merger of the business units Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care into the new business unit , Consumer Brands , and the respective progress updates \u2013 together with the strategic directions of the business units , financial reporting , overall performance by the business units and in the HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 78THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Implementation progress In addition to the statutory minimum quota specified in Section 96 ( 2 ) AktG , the Supervisory Board believes that the aforementioned requirements were met in full in the reporting period . Overall , the Supervisory Board believes it has the knowledge and skills needed to properly and effectively perform its duties . Several of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are or were members of management boards in relevant corporations and are experienced and skilled in managing globally operating corporations and in leading employees . Equally , several shareholder representatives have in-depth knowledge in the fields of research and development , production , marketing , selling and distribution , digi-talization/e-commerce and sustainable management . The same applies for the fields of finance/accounting , financial control/risk management and governance/compliance . In addition , several shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board offer international business experience or other international expertise . No shareholder representative exceeded the specified maximum age at the time of their election . The GCGC recommendations on impartiality have been adopted . None of the shareholder representatives nor close family members of a shareholder representative is a former Management Board member , or performs board or committee functions or acts as a consultant for major competitors , and none are persons whose business or personal relationship with the corporation or members of the Management Board could create a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest . Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah , Supervisory Board Chair , and Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke , Audit Committee Chair , have both been members of the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years . According to the GCGC , this could indicate a lack of impartiality . After exercising their due discretion , the shareholder representatives judged that \u2013 despite this indication \u2013 Dr. Bagel-Trah and Prof. Dr. Kaschke may be regarded as independent from the corporation and its Management Board as seen from an overall perspective . Dr. Bagel-Trah and Prof. Dr. Kaschke maintain the necessary impartiality toward the corporation and the Management Board in the performance of their office and their respective functions . Their conduct of office demonstrates a critical approach to the issues and questions to be assessed , while safeguarding the interests of the corporation . The other shareholder representatives had been members of the Supervisory Board for less than twelve years in the year under review and had not been in any other personal or business relationship with the corporation or its Management Board that could create a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest . According to the precepts of Recommendation C.7 GCGC , these shareholder representatives are HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 79THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR therefore independent from the corporation and the Management Board . The shareholder side therefore believes that all shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are independent from the corporation and the Management Board . Four of the eight shareholder representatives \u2013 Barbara Kux , Simone Menne , Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke and Poul Weihrauch \u2013 are not party to the Henkel family share-pooling agreement ; under GCGC Recommendation C.9 , they are therefore independent from the controlling shareholder . Apart from Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah , none of the shareholder representatives in office is a member of the Shareholders \u2019 Committee or the Super-visory Board of Henkel Management AG.As such , the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board include what they believe to be a reason-able number of independent members as recommended by the GCGC . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 99THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR In addition , we have effectively strengthened our portfolio by acquiring the hair salon business of Shiseido in Asia-Pacific and with that significantly expanded our position in this attractive market . The complementary portfolio featuring premium hair care , hair coloration and hair styling products includes leading hair salon brands such as Sublimic or Primience , which are marketed under the umbrella brand Shiseido Professional exclusively to salons.Selected acquisitions in fiscal 2022 BusinessKey countries C o n t r a c t signed on C o m p l e t i o n o n P u r c h a s e p r i c e in million euros F o r f u r t h e r information , see pages Acquisition of Shiseido \u2018 s Hair Professional business in Asia-Pacific Japan , China , South Korea 2/9/2022 7/1/2022 81 131\u2013132 , 215\u2013218 In addition , we expanded our expertise for innovative surface technologies and thermal management solutions in the Adhesive Technologies business unit . We also made advancements in the area of innovations . Our innovation and customer centers play a key role in this respect . With the new global innovation center of Adhesive Technologies \u2013 the Inspiration Center D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 we aim to boost our innovative strength . We have developed and launched numerous innovative products and solutions across all business units that address important trends and offer relevant added value to customers and consumers . In our Adhesive Technologies business unit , for example , we have developed high-performance sealants for battery housings in electric vehicles , which protect the battery against moisture , corrosion and dust , and enhance safety . Moreover , our innovative solvent-free adhesives enable more sustainability in the packaging industry and increase recyclability at the end of the value chain . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 100THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR In the Beauty Care business unit , we comprehensively relaunched our Schauma brand \u2013 with particular focus on sustainable product design . In our Professional business , we expanded the portfolio to include the hair colorant innovation The Unseen : Colour Alchemy . We also launched a hyper-personalized hair care solution under the new Schwarzkopf Professional brand SalonLab & Me , which offers hair stylists a new business model combining direct-to-consumer sales and in-salon experiences . In the Laundry & Home Care business unit , we strengthened our detergent brand Perwoll through a comprehensive relaunch , and we intro-duced a range of innovative dishwasher cleaning gels under our Somat brand . In 2022 again , we further anchored sustainability within our business operations . As part of our 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework , we worked on a more sustainable product portfolio , for example by increas-ing our use of renewable and recycled raw materials . We also made significant progress toward our goal of achieving a climate-positive carbon footprint for our production sites by 2030 by further expanding our use of renewable energy . We collaborated with partners to drive sustainable improvements along our value chain , with a focus placed on the area of supplier financing . In May 2022 , Henkel joined forces with Deutsche Bank to add sustainability metrics to an existing supplier financing program for the first time in Europe . The metrics are linked to the sustainability performance of Henkel \u2019 s suppliers . Sustainability criteria have therefore now been added to all Henkel supplier programs in the five regions . In addition , we expanded our sustainability training program for employees with the launch of our holistic sustainability engagement program \u201c Sustainability at Heart. \u201d We also made important progress in the area of digitalization in 2022 \u2013 including a further increase in digital sales across all business units . We have continued to drive the strategic alignment of our digital unit Henkel dx by steadily optimizing internal structures , strengthening the development of digital expertise and promoting a culture of innovation . The acceleration of digital innovations , our platform strategy and the close collaboration of all business units and functions have enabled us to further improve our efficiency in IT and to create new business opportunities for Henkel \u2013 in the area of business-to-business marketplaces , for example . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 101THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR To establish future-ready operating models , our focus in 2022 was on merging the Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care business units . Wolfgang K\u00f6nig , who has been responsible for the new Consumer Brands business unit since January 2023 , had already taken on responsibility in the Management Board for the Laundry & Home Care business unit back in October 2022 , in addition to his existing responsibility for the Beauty Care business unit . The new organizational structure of the integrated Consumer Brands business unit had been implemented in nearly all regions by the end of 2022 \u2013 ahead of the originally announced schedule . Related to this , the number of employees in our consumer businesses in fiscal 2022 decreased by around 1,000 year on year . Moreover , the structure of the Adhesive Technologies business unit with four business areas overseeing eleven strategic business units proved itself in a volatile environment . We have also further strengthened our corporate culture , building on our purpose \u2013 Pioneers at heart for the good of generations \u2013 and our Leadership Commitments . The creation of the integrated Consumer Brands business unit has also helped to strengthen our cultural transformation . In light of the associated changes to the organization , we focused on strengthening trust and responsibility in staying close to our Leadership Commitments . We also implemented new training and upskilling programs for employees , executives and teams . This included our comprehensive 360-degree feedback program for senior executives . Further areas of focus were the implementation of our holistic Smart Work concept \u2013 this provides the global framework for areas such as mobile working , digital workplace or employee health \u2013 and further global diversity , equity and inclusion ( DEI ) initiatives .

This is why we have been promoting flexible working models for years . Based on a culture of trust , part-time work , flexible working hours , new workplace concepts and mobile working are a natural part of our work . We are shaping the future of work with the holistic Smart Work concept that we developed in 2021 . The concept forms the global framework for mobile working , but also shows potential how our office landscapes might better support collaboration among our people , what improvements our health program can bring and which additional opportunities are offered by digitalization . Recruiting , developing and retaining talents As an employer , we want our employees as well as applicants and people interested in Henkel to be inspired and convinced by our culture and our career opportunities . As part of our global social media campaigns in 2022 , we provided more authentic insights into the day-to-day work of our employees around the world . The positive response to these formats and the high level of transparency are reflected by the growing numbers of followers on our social media channels and by our employer rankings and ratings .

( at December 31 ) HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 185THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Risks in connection with the company \u2019 s reputation and its brands Description of risk : As a globally active corporation , Henkel is exposed to potential damage to the reputation of its corporate brand \u2013 Henkel \u2013 or of our product brands , particularly in the consumer goods sector , in the event of negative reports in the media , including social media . These could lead to a negative impact on sales or the pace of growth . Measures : We minimize these risks through the measures described under legal and regulatory risks ( see pages 188 to 191 ) . On the one hand , this is to ensure that our production facilities and products are safe ; on the other , our active communications work strengthens the reputation of the corporate brand and our product brands . These measures are supported by a global communication network and international and local crisis management systems with regular training sessions . Technological risks ( IT and cyber risks ) Technological risks arise , in particular , from increasing digitalization . Description of risk : Information technology ( IT ) has strategic significance for Henkel . Our business processes rely to a great extent on internal and external IT services , applications , networks , and infrastructure systems . The failure or disruption of key IT services and the manipulation or loss of data \u2013 as a result of unauthorized access , for example \u2013 constitute material risks for Henkel . We analyze different potential in-house and external perpetrators and types of threat , such as intent , error or natural phenomena . The failure or disruption of important IT services can impair critical business processes . The loss of confidential data , for example formu-lations , customer information or price lists , could put us at a disadvantage with our competitors or give rise to legal consequences . Henkel \u2019 s reputation could also be damaged by such loss . Measures : The technical and organizational safeguards for assuring information and cyber security at Henkel are based on the international standards ISO 27001 and 27002 . Major components include the classification of information and IT applications with respect to confidentiality , availability , integrity and data protection requirements , as well as commensurate measures for mitigating risk . In addition , Henkel has put technical and organizational measures in place to prevent , discover and defeat cyber attacks . Henkel maintains regular contact with other major corporations , associations and specialized service providers in order to enable the early detection of threats and implementation of effective countermeasures . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 186THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Our critical business processes operate through redundantly configured systems designed for high availability . Our data backup procedures reflect best engineering practice . We regularly review our restore and disaster recovery processes . Access to buildings and areas containing IT systems , as well as user authorizations for our information systems , are limited to the minimum level necessary . For critical business processes , the required segregation of duties is enforced by technological means . Our IT services are protected against unauthorized external access and are consistently kept up to date . We develop our systems using proven project management and program modification procedures . We instruct and train our employees in the proper and secure use and operation of information systems as part of their regular duties . We require our IT service providers to maintain a comparable level of IT and cyber security . The implementation of our security measures is continually reviewed by our Internal Audit function , other internal departments , and independent third parties . Environmental risks ( environmental , safety and health risks ) Description of risk : Henkel is a global manufacturing corporation and , through its operating activities , is therefore exposed to risks pertaining to the environment , safety and health , manifesting in the form of personal injury , physical damage to goods , and reputational damage . For example , soil contamination and the associated remediation expense , as well as leakage or other technical failures , could give rise to direct costs for the corporation . Furthermore , indirect costs such as fines , claims for compensation or reputational damage may also be incurred . We assign the highest priority to the health and safety of our customers , consumers and employees . Despite global progress in vaccination , staff shortages may still occur due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Long-term risks arise in particular from accelerated climate change , water scarcity and restrictions on dispos-able and , in particular , non-recyclable plastic packaging and product ingredients . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 187THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Accelerating climate change could have negative impacts on a wide range of countries , particularly through increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events . In addition to physical risks , this develop-ment may also give rise to socioeconomic , so-called \u201c transition \u201d risks , for example as a result of political measures such as regulations and taxes . A more detailed discussion of relevant potential climate-related risks can be found in our Sustainability Report 2022 on pages 36 to 38 . The information is aligned to the recom-mendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ( TCFD ) . Population and economic growth , and also , potentially , climate change impacts , can exacerbate water scarcity in various regions . An acute , local water shortage or legal restrictions on the use of water can have a direct impact on the activities of our suppliers , our own operations , and our customers and consumers . Regulations to protect water resources , as well as changes in customer and consumer expectations , could have an impact on our raw material and product portfolio . Restrictions on disposable and , in particular , non-recyclable plastic packaging , as well as increasing requirements for distributors and manufacturers of plastic packaging , for example in the context of \u201c extended producer responsibility , \u201d and also those governing the use of recyclate and the recyclability of packaging , could have an impact on the marketability and profitability of the current product and packaging portfolio . Measures : We take specific measures to minimize these risks ( see the measures described under legal and regulatory risks on pages 188 to 191 ) , and organize appropriate auditing , advisory and training activities . We continually update these preventive measures in order to properly safeguard our facilities , assets and repu-tation . We ensure compliance with high technical standards , rules of conduct , and relevant statutory re-quirements as a further means of preserving our assets , and make sure that our corporate values \u2013 one of which is sustainability \u2013 are put into practice . We have established comprehensive monitoring systems and a global holistic crisis management system to manage extreme weather incidents , knock-on effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other crises , which defines protection strategies at all our sites and for all employees . Protecting the physical and mental health of our employees is integral to securing our workflows . We achieve high uptake through extensive communication , information and support programs . Targeted measures to protect and promote health are implemented on the basis of employee surveys . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 190THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR There is also a risk that our corporate values and our ethical , compliance and sustainability requirements are not adequately mirrored by our contractual partners . Even if corresponding requirements exist for our partners in the supply chain , violations that may lead to claims by third parties or damage our reputation can not be ruled out . Equally , as a globally active company , we maintain business relations with customers in countries that are subject to export control legislation , embargoes , economic sanctions , exclusion policies or other forms of trade restriction . Changes to these regulations , new or extended sanctions , or corresponding initiatives by institutional investors or non-governmental organizations may result in restrictions being imposed on our business activities in these countries or , indirectly , in other countries , or may prevent us from acquiring or keeping customers and suppliers . We see long-term risks , for example , in tax law developments and requirements arising from the increased focus on human rights . This is because national and international laws on human rights due diligence and the associated sanctions for potential violations could make international procurement and sales activities considerably more difficult and lead to significant cost increases due to the verification and documentation effort required , possible liability risks , and also contradictory requirements in different jurisdictions . Measures : Our internal standards , guidelines , codes of conduct , and training measures are geared to ensuring compliance with the aforementioned statutory requirements and , for example , safeguarding our manufac-turing facilities and products . These precepts have also been incorporated into our management systems and are regularly reviewed . This includes the early monitoring and evaluation of relevant statutory and regulatory requirements and changes . HENKEL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 191THE COMPANY SHARES AND BONDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION CREDITS CONTACTS FINANCIAL CALENDAR Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations is an integral component of our operating models and busi-ness processes . This includes the early monitoring and evaluation of relevant statutory and regulatory re-quirements and changes . Henkel has further established a Group-wide compliance organization with locally and regionally responsible compliance officers led by a globally responsible General Counsel & Chief Com-pliance Officer , which carries out appropriate risk analyses and risk-mitigating measures , such as training courses , or initiates internal audits ( details can be found in the corporate governance statement on pages 51 to 85 ) . In addition , our corporate legal department maintains constant contact with local counsel . Current proceedings and potential risks are recorded in a separate reporting system . For certain legal risks , we have concluded insurance policies with coverage that we consider to be appropriate and standard for the industry . However , the outcome of proceedings is inherently difficult to foresee , especially in cases in which the claimant is seeking substantial or unspecified damages . In view of this , we are unable to predict what obligations may arise from such litigations .

We live in a culture in which high levels of integrity, reliability and quality are vital to win the trust of customers, investors and employees. For us, this means that we make commitments that are achievable and promises we can keep. Infineon requires that its employees and business partners respect and observe all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Essential principles of ethical behavior are defined in the Business Conduct Guidelines1 and the CSR Policy. Some of these principles go beyond the legal requirements, in which case we are guided by inter- national standards and principles, such as the International Bill of Human Rights or the UN Global Compact Principles.\nIn order to implement these principles, Infineon has introduced a compliance management system for all Group companies. The compliance management system includes an annual formalized risk assessment, dealing in particular with corruption and antitrust law. The measures that need to be taken identified in the assessment are summarized in the compliance program and implemented during the fiscal year. The risk assessment entails both analyses at the Group level and structured inter- views at the site and central function levels. The assessment essentially confirmed\nthe known risk areas. The compliance program therefore includes detailed training and communication measures, business partner checks, processes and tools, the revision of regulations and general advice on compliance issues.\nThe Corporate Compliance Officer, heading a worldwide team, is responsible for coordinating the compliance management system. She reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer and on a quarterly basis to the Management Board, as well as to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Investment, Finance and Audit Committee. In addition to the development of our compliance program, the officer helps create guidelines, advises employees, receives complaints and information on relevant issues and heads the investigation of compliance cases.\nFollowing the successful Group-wide certification of the compliance management system in accordance with IDW2 Standard PS3 980 in the 2019 fiscal year, reviews of the compliance management system are conducted by Internal Audit. These reviews form a significant part of the audit planning. Employees and business partners took advantage of the opportunities available, both internally (Management, Human Resources and Compliance) and externally (Infineon Integrity Line), to report actual\n1 The Business Conduct Guidelines have been published in 17 languages.\n2 IDW: The Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (German: Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer) publishes Principles for the Proper\nPerformance of Reasonable Assurance Engagements Relating to Compliance Management Systems. 3 PS: Auditing Standard (German: Pr\u00fcfungsstandard).\nInfineon | Sustainability at Infineon 2022\n    \nNon-Financial Report\nBusiness ethics\nor suspected violations during the 2022 fiscal year. There was an increase in the 2022 fiscal year in the number of reports made and investigations conducted. We attribute this rise mainly to the resumption of business trips and to the resulting increase in personal contact with our business partners. CHART 03 When assessing possible breaches, Infineon distinguishes between various degrees of severity. A number of employees in the low double digits left Infineon as a result of a compliance case, either after the termination of their employment or voluntarily. Moreover, in other cases, sanctions in accordance with labor law were imposed, such as cautions and formal warnings.\nThe Business Conduct Guidelines form the central element of our compliance management system. As a code of conduct, the Guidelines are an essential basis for our daily actions and apply to all employees and members of corporate bodies worldwide when dealing with one another, our customers, investors, business partners or the public. All the company\u2019s employees and members of corporate bodies are trained on the content on a regular basis in web-based sessions or face-to-face. Since the 2021 fiscal year, all employees have been automatically enrolled in web-based Business Conduct Guidelines training (which forms part of\n15\n         CHART 03 Reports of possible compliance breaches 50,288\nthe learning management system) on an ongoing basis. This also applies to training for selected target groups on the topics of corruption prevention and antitrust law. All these training sessions are repeated every three years. Business partners are contractually obliged to comply with the legal regulations. Suppliers acknowledge our Supplier Code of Conduct when signing the contract. In addition, we conduct business partner checks to ensure that we work together with law-abiding business partners with integrity.\nTax management and governance\nOur business activities worldwide generate a variety of different taxes in the various countries, including corporate taxes, production taxes and other levies. Infineon also pays income taxes for its employees. The same applies to indirect taxes such as VAT (value added tax). The taxes paid are an important part of our economic contribution in the countries where we operate. With our Tax Compliance and Governance Report, we disclose tax management and related governance matters and create an important basis for dialog with our stakeholders. Here, we conduct a continuing assessment of legal and regulatory requirements and the interests of these stakeholders. The Tax Compliance and Governance Report can be downloaded from our website.\nwww.infineon.com/tax_report\nPersonal data and the protection of privacy\nData protection is a high priority for Infineon. Our clear objective is always to process the personal data of employees, customers, interested parties, suppliers, investors and other partners in accordance with globally applicable data protection laws.\nWith the data protection management system which we have been operating successfully for many years and are continuously improving, we have adopted a structured and systematic approach that ensures compliance with globally applicable data protection laws. Within our management system, continual assessments are performed of changes to the legal framework, and potential\nThe image is a bar chart titled \"Chart 03: Reports of possible compliance breaches\" that visualizes data from 2018 to 2022, detailing reports of possible compliance breaches within an organization. Here's a detailed breakdown of the elements:\n\n1. **Annual Reports Overview**:\n   - Each year from 2018 to 2022 is represented by a vertical bar, divided into three sections to denote different outcomes of reported compliance breaches:\n     - **Confirmed as Compliance Breach (after investigation)**: Represented in purple.\n     - **Confirmed as Non-Breach (after investigation)**: Represented in gray.\n     - **Still Under Investigation**: Represented in teal (only visible in 2022).\n\n2. **Annual Data Points**:\n   - **2018**: A total of 114 reports were made. Out of these, 66 were confirmed as non-breaches, and 48 were confirmed as breaches.\n   - **2019**: Out of 178 reports, 102 were confirmed as breaches, and 76 as non-breaches.\n   - **2020**: There were 134 reports with 73 confirmed as non-breaches and 61 as breaches.\n   - **2021**: This year saw 142 reports, with 72 confirmed as breaches, 70 as non-breaches.\n   - **2022**: A total of 161 reports were made, with 73 confirmed as breaches, 62 confirmed as non-breaches, and 26 still under investigation.\n\n3. **Trend Line**:\n   - A gray trend line overlays the bars, indicating the number of employees over the years, showing substantial growth from about 40,098 in 2018 to 55,502 in 2022. This provides context for the number of reports relative to the size of the organization.\n\nThe chart effectively illustrates both the number and outcomes of reported compliance breaches over five years, offering insight into the organizational response to compliance issues and the evolution of the workforce. It also shows an increase in compliance reports over time, which could correlate with the increasing number of employees.\n\n55\n    UN Global Compact Principles\nEnvironment\nPrinciple 7:\nBusinesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;\nPrinciple 8:\nundertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and\nPrinciple 9:\nencourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.\nAnti-Corruption\nPrinciple 10:\nBusinesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.\nMeasures implemented\n\u203a Our IMPRES (Infineon Integrated Management Program for Environment, Energy, Safety and Health) is globally certified in accordance with ISO 14001 and ISO 45001.

As part of these definitions, the management responsible sets appropriate targets at site level and ensures the achievement of the targets. Infineon has set itself the target of becoming carbon-neutral by the end of the 2030 fiscal year in terms of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. By the end of the 2025 fiscal year, it should have already reduced CO2 emissions by 70 percent compared with the 20191 calendar year.\n\u203a Internal environmental, energy, occupational safety and health audits and external certification audits take place at the sites in the context of our multi-site certification.\n\u203a In order to further increase awareness of the topic of preventing corruption in the company, this topic is included in the web-based Business Conduct Guidelines training. In addition, specific web-based training on the prevention of corruption is continuously and automatically rolled out for particular target groups. All new employees belonging to these target groups are automatically signed up for mandatory web-based training sessions. We also conduct business partner checks to ensure that we work together with law-abiding business partners with integrity.\n\u203a The rules that apply to the reporting of compliance violations are set out in our Business Conduct Guidelines.\n          Infineon | Sustainability at Infineon 2022\n1 In line with our carbon neutrality goal, with the 2019 calendar year as the base year, the relevant data of Cypress are included.\n\n    GRI Content Index\n61\n       Topic\n201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change\n201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans\n201-4 Financial assistance received from government\nIndirect economic impacts\nGRI 103: Management Approach 2016\n103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary\n103-2 The management approach and its components\n103-3 Evaluation of the management approach\nGRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016\n203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported\n203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts\nAnti-corruption\nGRI 103: Management Approach 2016\n103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary\n103-2 The management approach and its components\n103-3 Evaluation of the management approach\nGRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016\n205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures\nAnti-competitive Behavior\nGRI 103: Management Approach 2016\n103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary\n103-2 The management approach and its components\n103-3 Evaluation of the management approach\nGRI 206: Anti-competitive Behavior 2016\n206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices\nPage Report Sustainability Page\nat Infineon 2022 Annual Report 2022\nRemark\nrough the use of products in which our semiconductors are used, Infineon has indirect economic impacts, for example, in efficiency improvements.

This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in the German language, whereas the German text is authoritative.\nThis responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. Furthermore, this responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Report in a way that is free of \u2013 intended or unintended \u2013 material misstatements.\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing Delegated Acts contain wordings and terms that are still subject to substantial uncertainties regarding their interpretation and for which not all clarifications have been published yet. Therefore, the legal representatives have included a description of their interpretation in Section\n\u201cEU Taxonomy\u201d of the combined separate non-financial report. They are responsible for its tenability. Due to the innate risk of diverging interpretations of vague legal concepts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to uncertainty.\nPractitioner\u2019s Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the Report, including the selected qualifying sections in the Combined Management Report, and with reasonable assurance on the selected non-financial disclosures \u201cProportion of women in management positions\u201d and \u201cCO2 emissions and reduction\u201d based on our work performed.\nWe conducted our work on the Report, including the selected qualifying sections in the Combined Management Report, in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \u201cAssurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d, published by the Inter- national Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), as a limited assurance engagement.

We do not, however, provide a separate conclusion for each disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement, the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The choice of audit procedures is subject to the auditor\u2019s own judgement.\nWithin the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst others the following procedures:\n\u203a Understanding the design and implementation of systems and processes for the identification, processing and monitoring of turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure disclosures for taxonomy-eligible economic activities\n\u203a Interviewing employees at Group level in order to gain an understanding of the approach to identifying material issues and corresponding reporting boundaries of Infineon\nThe legal representatives have to interpret vague legal concepts in order to be able to compile the relevant disclosures according to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.

The compliance programme contains a summary of the actions that must be completed, which are then carried out throughout the fiscal year. In order to assess risk, formal interviews are conducted at the site and central function levels in addition to group-level analysis. \n- The compliance management system is coordinated by the Corporate Compliance Officer, who leads a global team. She answers directly to the Chief Financial Officer, the Management Board, and the Investment, Finance, and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on a quarterly basis.\n- The officer not only develops our compliance programme but also assists in creating guidelines, counsels staff, takes complaints and pertinent information, and oversees the investigation of compliance matters. Workers and business partners can report potential violations to our Infineon Integrity Line, which also accepts anonymous reports, or to the standard internal bodies (Management, HR, and Compliance). \n-Every three years, all of these training sessions are repeated. Contractually, business partners are required to abide with the law. When they sign the contract, suppliers agree to abide by our supplier code of conduct. In order to make sure that we collaborate with honest, law-abiding business partners, we also perform business partner checks.\n-Training on compliance is also conducted at the board and management levels. For Infineon, segmenting training attendance based on certain staff categories or geographies is not a global control parameter.\n-Every employee is enrolled automatically in continuous training on the Business Conduct Guidelines. This also holds true for training on antitrust law and corruption prevention for certain target groups. Employees of the company and members of corporate bodies receive frequent in-person or web-based training on the subject matter.\nIn summary the company does not meet the G1-3 regulations due to missing details about the coverage rate for instance."}]}

Compliance Values**:\n   - Positioned at the top, this is the foundational element of the CMS. It represents the core principles and ethical standards that guide the organization's compliance efforts.\n\n2. **II. Compliance Objectives**:\n   - Directly flows from the Compliance Values, indicating that the objectives of the CMS are derived from these foundational values.\n\n3. **III. Compliance Organization**:\n   - This component is about the structural setup of the compliance team or department within the organization, detailing how it is organized to meet compliance objectives.\n\n4. **IV. Compliance Risks**:\n   - Identifies potential compliance-related risks that the organization might face, suggesting a proactive approach to risk management.\n\n5. **V. Compliance Programme**:\n   - Details the specific programs and policies implemented to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and internal standards.\n\n6. **VI. Communication & Training**:\n   - Focuses on how the organization communicates its compliance policies internally and how it trains employees to adhere to these policies, ensuring they are well-informed and equipped to comply.\n\n7. **VII. Monitoring & Improvement**:\n   - The final component, indicating a continuous process where the CMS is regularly monitored for effectiveness and improved based on findings and evolving compliance needs.\n\n### Flow of Information\nThe arrows show a clear flow of information and dependency:\n- Starting from Compliance Values, branching out to Objectives and Organization, and flowing into Risk identification.\n- From Risk identification, the flow moves into specific Compliance Programs, which are supported through Communication and Training.\n- Finally, all efforts are under constant Monitoring and Improvement to close the loop, ensuring ongoing refinement and responsiveness of the CMS.\n\nThis structure underscores a comprehensive and systematic approach to compliance, highlighting the organization's commitment to maintaining high ethical and legal standards across its operations.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

In the field of sales activities in high-risk nations, the Group observes heightened corruption concerns. The measures must be implemented and overseen by the management of each Group entity. The management team works closely with the Integrity and Legal Affairs division's specialised sections on this assignment. The management teams at each of the Group entities are under observation by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. \n- An impartial Local Compliance Officer supports businesses that are more likely to experience corruption, helping the corresponding management carry out the Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme.Mercedes-Benz Group AG hired KPMG AG to audit its Compliance Management System for corruption prevention in order to guarantee an impartial, external evaluation of the Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme. The Business Practices Office (BPO) whistleblower mechanism allows business partners, third parties, and all workers globally to report rule infractions. \n- Information can be given to the BPO via regular mail, email, or by completing a specific web form. The BPO is open for business around-the-clock. There are other external toll-free hotlines in the US, Brazil, Japan, and South Africa. If local regulations allow it, reports can also be submitted anonymously. In addition to the BPO, whistleblower complaints in Germany may also be sent to an outside, impartial middleman.  Within 24 hours of receiving a new report, the BPO typically notifies the whistleblower that it has been received. Following a preliminary risk assessment grounded in the four eyes principle, the BPO refers the case to the relevant department or an appropriate investigative unit.\n- The Mercedes-Benz Group uses a range of communication strategies to make the BPO whistleblower system even more widely known to employees and to continuously build employee trust in it. In this case, the organisation additionally considers the insights gleaned from the most current employee survey.\n- The Group offers educational resources like information cards tailored to each countries, pocket manuals, and a ten-language training DVD. The Mercedes-Benz Group provides each of its suppliers and sales partners with access to a Compliance Awareness Module, which is based on these principles and the Integrity Code. \n- To successfully complete each module, one must correctly answer test and control questions in the web-based training courses as a review of the knowledge you have received. \n- Administrative staff members have access to a web-based training programme designed for particular target audiences. This programme comprises not only a basic module that is required, but also manager-specific modules and expert modules covering a range of compliance problems. Mercedes-Benz Group AG automatically designates the appropriate modules to staff members upon hiring, promotion, or transitioning to a role with a higher level of risk. Every three years, employees are required to finish the training programme. It is not stated exactly what the scope and coverage rate of the training programme are.It seems that Mercedes Benz almost fulfillers the G1-3 regulations except the secure independence investigation committee."}]}

Importantly, we\nseek to emphasize compliance by acting in line with our company values and believe that profitable business\noperations should go hand in hand with the highest ethical standards.\nRoles and responsibilities\nOur Group Compliance function is responsible for the framework of the following core topics: the Merck Code of\nConduct, anti-corruption and anti-bribery (including healthcare compliance, third-party due diligence,\ntransparency reporting), anti-money laundering, antitrust, and conflicts of interest.\nTo cover these topics, we have Group-wide policies, standards and procedures in place that ensure our business\nactivities comply with the relevant laws, regulations and international ethical standards. Other compliance-\nrelated issues, including the respective internal regulations and guidelines, such as Pharmacovigilance, Export\nand Import Controls, and Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Quality, are managed by the responsible\nfunctions.\nOur Group Compliance function is responsible for our compliance portfolio, which consists of the following\nelements:\n\u2022 Risk Assessment: Identifying internal and external critical risks in regular business operations\n\u2022 Policies & Procedures: Global policies, procedures and standards to mitigate identified risks\n\u2022 Compliance Committee/Forums: Platform for compliance-related discussion and decision-making, including\nrelevant key functions\n\u2022 Training & Awareness: Appropriate training and additional measures to educate and keep awareness high\n\u2022 Programs & Tools: Comprehensive compliance programs and supporting tools contributing to internal\ncontrols and overall governance\n\u2022 Monitoring & Reporting: Tracking of compliance-related data; perform internal and external reporting\n\u2022 Case Management: Timely response to reports of misconduct and implementation of corrective actions\n\u2022 Continuous Improvement: Based on and applying to all compliance program elements\nOur Chief Compliance Officer reports on the status of our compliance activities, potential risks and serious\ncompliance violations to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board twice a year at a minimum. As part of our\nregular reporting processes, we compile a comprehensive compliance and data privacy report annually for the\nExecutive Board. This includes the status of our compliance program, continuous improvement initiatives and\nkey figures on compliance and data privacy cases. Additionally, we prepare a mid-year update to highlight\nongoing developments and the status of relevant projects and initiatives.\nOur Chief Compliance Officer oversees all Compliance departments and the underlying Compliance Officers and\nCompliance experts around the world. The Compliance Officers implement our compliance program within their\nrespective areas of responsibility (adapting to local regulations) and receive guidance from our Group\nCompliance Center of Expertise. This is a centralized body that drives the design and evolution of our\ncompliance program across all business sectors and Group functions. 145\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\nOur commitment: Guidelines and standards\nOur compliance program builds on our company values and integrates these into our compliance framework,\nwhich consists of Group-wide policies, standards and procedures for entrepreneurial conduct. The following are\nmandatory for all our employees:\n\u2022 Merck Code of Conduct\n\u2022 Human Rights Charter\n\u2022 Anti-Corruption Standard\n\u2022 Anti-Money Laundering Group Standard\n\u2022 Conflict of Interest Policy\n\u2022 Antitrust and Competition Law Policy\n\u2022 Compliance Reporting and Investigation Policy\n\u2022 Dawn Raid Policy\n\u2022 Standard on Local Compliance Standards\n\u2022 Supplier Code of Conduct (formerly Responsible Sourcing Principles)\nRisk assessment\nProper compliance risk management is crucial to identify undetected risks and ensure our company remains\nprotected. For this purpose, we are implementing a compliance risk identification process. We started this\ninitiative by launching a global compliance risk process for all our business sectors to improve objectivity and\nenable a more data-driven risk approach. In addition, we established a comprehensive risk matrix that focuses\non bribery and corruption risks, illustrated through in-depth risk categorization and risk scenarios. As a next\nstep, in 2022, we started conducting country-based risk assessments. This approach considers gross and net\nrisks while looking at tangible risk scenarios for the respective business. During this process, Group Compliance\nworks closely with the businesses to enhance their risk awareness and create a better understanding of\ncompliance risks. The first round of this process includes high-risk countries. By 2022, we rolled out a risk\nidentification process to get a better risk overview on bribery and corruption related risks.\nConflicts of interest\nWe take all potential conflicts of interest seriously. Employees must avoid situations where their professional\njudgment may come into conflict with their personal interests. They must also disclose every potential conflict\nof interest to their supervisor and document the disclosure. Such issues are typically resolved directly between\nthe employee and the supervisor but can also be routed to Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, or other\nrelevant functions.\nManagement and requirements of third parties\nFor compliance management to be effective, it must not be restricted to the boundaries of our own company.\nWhile our supplier management processes focus on vendor compliance with our standards, our global Third\nParty Risk Management process governs interactions with sales parties, such as commercial agents, distributors\nand dealers. We expect our third parties worldwide to adhere to our compliance principles. We collaborate only\nwith parties who pledge to comply with relevant laws, reject all forms of bribery, and adhere to environmental,\nhealth and safety guidelines. 146\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\nWe apply a risk-based approach to select the third parties with whom we do business. The greater the\nestimated risk regarding a particular country, region, or type of service, the more in-depth we examine the\nthird party before entering into a business relationship. We also explore background information from various\ndatabases and information reported by third parties.\nIf we encounter compliance concerns, we further analyze and verify the relevant information. Based on the\noutcome, we decide whether to reject the potential third party, impose conditions to mitigate identified risks or\nterminate the existing relationship. By end of 2023, we plan that all subsidiaries of our company will have a\nnew Third Party Risk Management process and tool, for due diligence of all high risk third parties \u2013 to conduct\nbusiness only with those that are legally compliant.\nCompliance training\nWe provide regular compliance classroom and online training courses on our Code of Conduct, anti-corruption,\nantitrust, data privacy, anti-money laundering, and healthcare compliance standards. We require employees to\ntake these courses based on their exposure to risk. Some courses also apply to independent contractors and\nsupervised workers, such as temporary employees.\nWe introduced a new Conflicts of Interest e-learning module that explains what conflicts of interests are and\nhow these should be managed within our company. The course is available in nine languages. Furthermore, we\nlaunched a new e-learning course to provide an overview of our Third-Party Risk Management and to\nemphasize the importance of Third-Party Risk Assessments.\nAnti-money laundering\nWe have implemented a global anti-money laundering (AML) program consisting of a global Anti-Money\nLaundering Group Standard, training and a dedicated process to report and investigate red flags as well as any\nhigh-risk transactions. Suspicious transactions are reported to the German Financial Intelligence Unit or other\nauthorities as required.\nWe aim to continuously improve our AML program. Following a worldwide risk assessment in 2021 to identify\njurisdictions imposing the strictest legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses, we initiated\nin-depth AML risk assessments for higher-risk jurisdictions. Based on these assessments and constant review of\nchanges in the legal environment, we are implementing stricter local AML programs where required.\nReporting potential compliance violations\nWe encourage all employees worldwide to report potential compliance violations to their supervisors, Legal, HR\nor other relevant departments. Globally, they can also use our central whistleblowing compliance hotline free of\ncharge and anonymously to report violations in their local language by telephone or via a web-based\napplication. Reports of potential compliance violations that we receive via our compliance hotline are reviewed\nby the Compliance Investigations and Case Management team.\nCases with a certain risk profile are presented to the Compliance Case Committee, which comprises senior\nrepresentatives from our Compliance, Corporate Security, Data Privacy, Human Resources, Internal Auditing,\nand Legal departments. The Committee\u2019s duties include assessing and classifying certain compliance issues,\ninvestigating their background, and addressing these issues using appropriate measures.\nBased on the investigation outcome and recommendations from the compliance investigation team or the\nCompliance Case Committee, appropriate disciplinary action may be taken against employees who have\ncommitted a compliance violation. If, during the investigation, a root cause is identified that could lead to the\nrisk of further compliance violations, we take preventive and corrective actions.\nThe compliance hotline is also available to external stakeholders. The relevant information can be found in the\nCompliance and Ethics section of our website. 147\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\nThe number of suspected compliance violations reported remained stable compared with the previous year,\nwhile the number of confirmed compliance violations decreased. In 2022, we received 79 compliance-related\nreports via the compliance hotline and other channels that were processed as cases. 28 violations of the Code\nof Conduct or other internal and external rules were confirmed.\nReported compliance violations\n2022 2022\n2019 2020 2021 Merck Group thereof: Merck KGaA\nTotal number of reported compliance\nviolations\nNumber of reported compliance incidents 75 81 79 79 3\nNumber of confirmed cases 30 41 42 28 0\nConfirmed cases by category\nBribery and corruption 9 6 1 2 0\nViolation of cartel laws and fair competition\nrules 0 0 0 1 0\nFraudulent actions against Merck 8 11 6 11 0\nOther violations of the Merck Compliance\nPrinciples for the relations with business\npartners 4 0 0 2 0\nOther violations of Merck values, internal\nguidelines or legal requirements 9 24 35 12 0\nCompliance audits\nCompliance is ensured by Group Compliance and Group Internal Auditing as the second and third lines of\ndefense. As part of the audits, Group Internal Auditing regularly reviews functions, processes and legal entities\nworldwide. These reviews include an assessment of the effectiveness of the respective compliance guidelines,\nprocesses and structures in place. The units also check for violations of our Code of Conduct and our Anti-\nCorruption Standard.\nOur audit planning aims to provide comprehensive risk assurance through the best possible audit coverage of\nour processes. We take a risk-based approach to our annual audit planning process, considering factors such as\nsales, employee headcount, systematic stakeholder feedback and the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)\npublished by the non-governmental organization Transparency International. If an internal audit gives rise to\nrecommendations, Group Internal Auditing performs a systematic follow-up and monitors the implementation of\nthe recommended corrective actions. In 2022, Group Internal Auditing conducted 79 internal audits involving\nbribery and corruption-related risks, including 52 operational and 24 IT audits and 3 special audits which may,\nfor example, be initiated as part of incident-specific internal investigations.\nInteractions with health systems\nWe support health systems by providing information to our healthcare stakeholders, such as professional\nmedical associations, patient advocacy groups, university clinics and other institutions that provide healthcare.\nWe follow clearly defined internal approval requirements and procedures for each type of interaction, in line\nwith applicable laws and codes. In countries with statutory or industry obligations on the disclosure of transfers\nof value to healthcare stakeholders, we aim to comply with these obligations.\nDirect-to-consumer advertising only in certain countries\nDirect-to-consumer (DTC) advertising for prescription medicines is permitted in some countries, such as the\nUnited States. In line with applicable local laws, we use DTC advertising in these countries to help increase\npeople\u2019s awareness of certain diseases and the available therapies. 148\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\nRoles and responsibilities\nFor all interactions with healthcare stakeholders, we have established internal policies and review processes and\ntools, such as record-keeping systems, to ensure adherence to statutory requirements and transparency\nobligations.\nOur Global Regulatory Affairs unit has established a dedicated standard and corresponding process document\non the review and approval of our promotional materials for our Healthcare business sector. At the operational\nlevel, the relevant business and all employees involved in our sales and marketing activities must adhere to our\ninternal policies, standards and procedures.\nTo ensure that all promotional materials meet our standards as well as local regulations end-to-end, we apply a\nharmonized Group-wide review and approval system.\nOur commitment: Group-wide guidelines and industry standards\nIn addition to applicable laws and our own internal standards, we comply with the codes of conduct of various\ninternational and local industry organizations, such as the Code of Practice published by the International\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the Code of Practice of the European\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) or the regulations of the U.S. Pharmaceutical\nResearch and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).\nMoreover, we apply various specific internal rules and regulations:\n\u2022 Pharma Code for Conducting Pharmaceutical Business and Pharmaceutical Operations (Pharma Code)\n\u2022 Healthcare Ethical Guiding Principles\n\u2022 Standard on Medical Activities\n\u2022 Policy on Interactions with Patients, Patient Opinion Leaders, and Patient Organizations\n\u2022 Guideline Good Practice and Process Guidance: Engagement with Patients, Patient Opinion Leaders, and\nPatient Organizations.\nTransparent reporting\nWe publish the financial and non-financial contributions we make to healthcare stakeholders in the healthcare\nindustry, such as healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as appropriate and in accordance with\nlocal laws and codes. The published information includes the names of individual recipients, their addresses, the\npurpose, and the contributed amount or value as required by the applicable laws and codes. In addition, before\npublishing, we secure all necessary informed consent forms, as required by the applicable data privacy\nregulations.\nRegular employee training\nWe are continuing our Code of Conduct training curriculum on managing dilemmas in sector-specific situations.\nEmployees who are responsible for the promotion of our pharmaceutical products receive regular training on\ncurrent guidelines. Depending on their roles and responsibilities, new employees, participate in onboarding\ntraining dealing with the review and approval of promotional materials. Based on their roles and responsibilities\nand to remain up-to-date, employees participate in mandatory e-learning courses and classroom training on our\npolicies and guidelines, as well as important changes to the reporting requirements for transfers of value. 149\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics\nOther topics\nSustainable innovation and technology\nThe sustainable innovation that we envision or drive forward must align with and support the three goals of our\nsustainability strategy. We define sustainable innovation as new or improved products, services, technologies,\nor processes that generate economic benefits and have positive environmental and social impacts. Therefore,\nwe develop long-term solutions for our innovation and research activities that consider the entire value chain\nand evaluate each product\u2019s impact over its lifecycle.\nToday, our products already have a positive impact on human progress and global health, namely our\nmedicines and our biological and chemical innovations that utilize the latest technologies. We want to\ncontinuously improve the way we measure our progress by adapting and integrating sustainability criteria into\nour product development processes across the business sectors.\nIn 2022, we continued our partnership with the well-established patent information platform LexisNexis\u00ae\nPatentSight\u00ae. In this context, we created a framework to evaluate the sustainability impact of our intellectual\nproperty. For 2022, we evaluated the baseline for the first time and identified that 27% of our patent families\npublished that year have a positive sustainability impact based on LexisNexis\u00ae PatentSight\u00ae.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe organizational set-up of our R&D activities reflects the overall structure of our company. All three of our\nbusiness sectors operate independent R&D units that pursue their own innovation strategies. Group Corporate\nSustainability supports our business sectors and Group functions to advance and integrate sustainability within\nthe R&D and innovation processes in line with our shared goals. We developed a methodology for creating a\nGroup-wide overview of the potential contribution of our R&D portfolio towards sustainable solutions that went\nlive in December 2022.\nOur Group Science & Technology Office leads the implementation of our combined strategy for innovation, data\nand digital, enabling innovation across our business sectors while harnessing the power of advanced data and\ndigital capacities. It aims to identify and integrate transformative, strategically relevant technology trends into\nour business sectors while maintaining a Group-wide view of our tech roadmap and innovation portfolio.\nFostering data and digital capacities is key to accelerating sustainable innovation and enabling rapid action and\npersonalized offerings. Innovation projects are incubated either through our corporate innovation teams or in\nthe business sectors.\nOur venture capital fund, M Ventures, prioritizes sustainable innovations through equity investments. The\nfund\u2019s mandate is to invest in innovative technologies and products that have the potential to significantly\nimpact our core business areas. In addition, the fund focuses on investments in two areas of high strategic\nrelevance to our company: digital technology and sustainability.\nM Ventures\u2019 sustainability investment strategy follows two fundamental approaches. First, it invests in\nsustainable solutions relevant to our three business sectors, such as novel solutions for reducing emissions and\nwaste, green life science technologies and green electronics technologies. These solutions may be more energy-\nor resource-efficient or may create products designed for circularity or with a lower carbon footprint. The\nsecond approach involves making investments that leverage our core competencies to drive sustainability in\nother markets. These may include start-ups addressing sustainable foods, bio-manufacturing, or carbon capture\nand utilization. 150\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics\nOur commitment: Aiming for circularity\nWithin our R&D processes, we are committed to continuously improving and integrating sustainability and\ncircular economy criteria to assess the sustainability performance of our products and portfolio. For example,\nour Life Science business sector developed Design for Sustainability (DfS) and the DOZN\u2122 tool to create more\nsustainable products for our customers. In 2022, we tailored and rolled out the DfS concept to our two other\nbusiness sectors and integrated an overarching company dashboard. In 2023, we aim to generate an\nunderstanding of our R&D portfolio and use the insights to steer future R&D activities. Therefore, we have\ndeveloped an indicator to track our progress. In addition, we have dedicated corporate resources for our\ncircular economy strategy and we are driving several circular economy pilots and initiatives throughout the\norganization.\nReporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nFundamentals\nThe EU taxonomy for sustainable activities (hereinafter \u201cEU Taxonomy\u201d) is a classification system that\ntranslates the climate and environmental objectives of the European Union (EU) into criteria for sustainable\neconomic activities. For this purpose, the EU Taxonomy defines various key performance indicators and\nqualitative information that Merck must disclose. The disclosure obligation under Article 8 of Regulation (EU)\n2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council dated June 18, 2020 on establishing a\nframework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter \u201cEU\nTaxonomy Regulation\u201d) and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard is being carried out in multiple phases:\n\u2022 For the 2021 reporting period, key performance indicators were stated only for so-called taxonomy-eligible\neconomic activities and were limited to those that make a substantial contribution to climate change\nmitigation or climate change adaptation as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation. An economic activity\nqualifies as taxonomy-eligible if it is within the scope of the EU Taxonomy.\n\u2022 For the 2022 reporting period, apart from the degree of taxonomy-eligible economic activities making a\nsubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation within the meaning of the\nEU Taxonomy Regulation, it is also necessary to report the taxonomy-aligned share of the identified\neconomic activities. According to the EU Taxonomy, an economic activity qualifies as taxonomy-aligned if it\nis taxonomy-eligible and makes a substantial contribution to one or more of the environmental objectives\nwithout doing significant harm to the other objectives or failing to fulfill minimum social standards.\n\u2022 As of the 2023 reporting period, four further environmental objectives of the EU are likely to be included in\nthe disclosure obligation: 1) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, 2) transition to a\ncircular economy, 3) pollution prevention and control, and 4) protection and restoration of biodiversity and\necosystems.\nApproach\nTo ensure the legally compliant fulfillment of its disclosure obligations, in 2020 Merck established an\ninterdisciplinary project team that is continuously analyzing the existence of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-\naligned activities in close coordination with the representatives of the business sectors and various Group\nfunctions.\nThe identification of the taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the environmental objectives \u201cclimate change\nmitigation\u201d and \u201cclimate change adaptation\u201d proceeded in line with a top-down approach using structured\ninquiries submitted to the relevant specialist departments. The results of this analysis were confirmed by\nsupplementary big data-supported analyses as part of a bottom-up approach. Among other things, information\nwas used that can also be found in connection with the requirements of the REACH regulation as well as in the\ncontext of customs declarations. 151\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics\nThe three key performance indicators (KPIs), namely net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure,\nwere mainly derived from existing financial reporting systems; for capital expenditure inquiries were made to\nthe Investment Controlling unit in some instances.\nMethodology for determining the taxonomy KPIs requiring publication\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the corresponding Delegated Acts contain wording and requirements which,\neven taking into account the supplementary publications of the EU Commission and the \u201cEU Platform on\nSustainable Finance\u201d, are subject to interpretation and for which clarifications have not yet been published in\nevery case. The most significant interpretive issues arising in this context are presented below.\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities of Merck\nTo check the taxonomy eligibility of an economic activity, Merck applies an end-product oriented approach for\nmanufacturing-related activities. This means that the end product must result from one of the economic\nactivities specified in the Delegated Act in order to qualify as being taxonomy-eligible. In the case of organic\nbasic chemicals, the corresponding economic activities only qualify as taxonomy-eligible in the interpretation of\nMerck if the manufacturing activities of the named chemical products involve a significant transformation\nprocess. In our interpretation, products that are merely passed on for sale, repackaged or mixed do not qualify\nas taxonomy-eligible within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn the course of implementing the EU Taxonomy requirements, the business model of Merck underwent a\ncomprehensive analysis. The core business activities of Merck are not mentioned in the economic activities set\nforth by the Delegated Act. Consequently, taxonomy-eligible activities were only identified to a very small\nextent in conjunction with the production of energy-efficient building equipment in the Electronics business\nsector. By contrast, neither the manufacture nor the distribution of pharmaceutical products or the distribution\nof specialty chemicals, which form the core of the business activities of the Life Science and Electronics\nbusiness sectors, qualify as application areas of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the first two environmental\nobjectives. Furthermore, ancillary activities that are operationally necessary for our core business also do not\nqualify as independent taxonomy-eligible economic activities. This applies, for example, to the acquisition or\nconstruction of production buildings, the transport of our products to our customers as well as to research and\ndevelopment activities that cannot be allocated to a taxonomy-eligible economic activity for the first two\nenvironmental objectives \u201cclimate change mitigation\u201d and \u201cclimate change adaptation\u201d.\nWith respect to capital expenditure, the EU Taxonomy Regulation differentiates between three categories of\ncapital expenditure:\n\u2022 Capital expenditure that relates to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n(Category A),\n\u2022 Capital expenditure that is part of a plan to expand taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to transform\ntaxonomy-eligible economic activities into taxonomy-aligned economic activities (Category B), and\n\u2022 Capital expenditure related to the acquisition of products from taxonomy-eligible economic activities and\nindividual measures that carry out the target activities in a low-carbon manner or reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions (Category C).\nBecause Merck only engages in taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the area of manufacturing energy-\nefficient building equipment to a very small extent owing to its business model, it has no significant capital\nexpenditure in category A. Furthermore, Merck has no capital expenditure in category B since it does not\nprepare any capital spending plans to transform the taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the first two\nenvironmental objectives \u201cclimate change mitigation\u201d and \u201cclimate change adaptation\u201d into taxonomy-aligned\neconomic activities. This is attributable to the fact that there are hardly any taxonomy-eligible activities due to\nthe business model of the Group. 152\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics\nConsequently, Merck only has capital expenditure for the first two environmental objectives resulting from the\nacquisition of products classified as taxonomy-eligible economic activities or are attributable to qualifying\nindividual measures (Category C). In order to be taxonomy-eligible, this capital expenditure must correspond to\none of the economic activities named in the Delegated Acts and be implemented and operational within 18\nmonths. At Merck, such capital expenditure exists especially in connection with\n\u2022 transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (activity 6.5)\n\u2022 construction and real estate (activities 7.2 to 7.7).\nIn order to exclude double counting, capital spending on products from taxonomy-aligned economic activities\nand individual measures that have already been checked under category A are only included under category A.\nAgainst this background, capital expenditure for production buildings, for example, is only subject to a\ntaxonomy-eligibility check under category A, while capital expenditure for administrative buildings is included\nunder category C.\nTaxonomy alignment of the economic activities of Merck\nIn order to check the taxonomy alignment of the taxonomy-eligible economic activities, the relevant regulations\nfor the technical screening criteria under which certain economic activities qualify as contributing substantially\nto the environmental objective as well as for determining whether the activity causes no significant harm to any\nof the other environmental objectives were systematically analyzed. The basis for this was the Delegated Acts\non the EU Taxonomy, which were used for the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities. In these,\ncorresponding requirements are defined for the respective economic activities, which must be fulfilled for a\nclassification as taxonomy-aligned. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with business and project\nmanagers and physical climate risk analyses were carried out at the sites. Furthermore, operating permits,\nproduct data sheets, environmental product declarations, energy performance certificates and internal training\ndocuments were inspected, among other things.\nMinimum safeguards\nThe minimum protection frameworks include the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United\nNations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the fundamental conventions of the International\nLabour Organization, and the International Bill of Human Rights. The requirements profile of the frameworks\nwas systematized and compared with internal documents. This included an analysis of the Code of Conduct,\nwork instructions, guidelines and training documents. Compliance with the due diligence process required by\nthe framework in the area of human rights is ensured with respect to the individual business activities. Risk\nanalyses are carried out with regard to the minimum protection requirements and appropriate measures are\nderived from these.\nTaxonomy KPIs\nNet sales\nThe KPI net sales represents the ratio of net sales from taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned economic\nactivities in a fiscal year to the total net sales of the same fiscal year. The definition of relevant net sales for the\npurposes of the EU Taxonomy Regulation corresponds to the definition of net sales in the consolidated financial\nstatements (see Note (9) \u201cNet sales\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nCapital expenditure\nThe share of capital expenditure on assets or processes associated with economic activities classified as\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned is determined as follows: Share of total capital expenditure that is\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned divided by total capital expenditure according to the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation. At Merck and within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, capital expenditure in the 153\nCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics\nreporting period comprises additions to property, plant and equipment (IAS 16), rights of use from leases\n(IFRS 16), and intangible assets (IAS 38) with the exception of goodwill. Apart from the additions, advance\npayments for the named assets are also included. The denominator also includes additions to property, plant\nand equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations. The additions can be seen in the\nchanges in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets disclosed in the consolidated financial\nstatements (see Note (20) \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d and Note (19) \u201cOther Intangible Assets\u201d in the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\nOperating expenditure\nThe share of operating expenditure for assets or processes associated with economic activities classified as\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned is determined as follows: Share of total operating expenditure that is\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned divided by total operating expenditure according to the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation. Operating expenditure relevant within the scope of reporting under the EU Taxonomy Regulation\nincludes direct, non-capitalized research and development costs, low-value leases, building renovations,\nmaintenance and repair, and all other direct internal and external expenses related to the day-to-day\nmaintenance of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continuous and effective\nfunctioning of these assets.\nFossil gas-related activities\nMerck operates a gas turbine and a co-generation unit to generate electricity and heat from fossil gaseous\nfuels. The unit serves to generate our own power and heat. The activities in the area of electricity generation\nfrom fossil gaseous fuels as well as the operation of co-generation units with fossil gaseous fuels are not\nsignificant at Merck. Additional activities in the field of nuclear energy and fossil gas are not performed. 196\nCombined Management Report ___ Capital Structure and Corporate Bodies of Merck KGaA\nCapital Structure and Corporate\nBodies of Merck KGaA\nFurther information can be found under \u201cMerck KGaA\u201d in the \u201cStatement on Corporate Governance\u201d. 197\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nStatement on Corporate\nGovernance\nThe Statement on Corporate Governance contains the Declaration of Conformity, relevant\ninformation on practices within the company, and a description of the procedures of the corporate\nbodies, as well as targets for the percentage of positions held by women and the diversity policy.\nJoint report of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board including\nDeclaration of Conformity\nThe German Corporate Governance Code is geared toward the conditions found in a German stock corporation\n(\u201cAktiengesellschaft\u201d or \u201cAG\u201d) and does not take into consideration the special characteristics of a corporation\nwith general partners (\u201cKommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien\u201d or \u201cKGaA\u201d) such as Merck KGaA. Given the\nstructural differences between an AG and a KGaA, several recommendations of the German Corporate\nGovernance Code are to be applied to a KGaA only in a modified form. Major differences between the two legal\nforms exist in terms of liability and management. In the case of an AG, only the AG is liable as a legal entity,\nwhereas the general partners of a KGaA also have unlimited personal liability for the company\u2019s obligations\n(section 278 (1) AktG). At Merck KGaA, this pertains to both E. Merck KG \u2013 which is excluded from\nmanagement and representation pursuant to article 8 (5) of the Articles of Association \u2013 as well as to the\nmanaging general partners who collectively make up the Executive Board of Merck KGaA. The members of the\nExecutive Board of Merck KGaA are therefore subject to unlimited personal liability. Unlike an AG, their\nexecutive authority is not conferred by the Supervisory Board, but rather by their status as general partners.\nConsequently, in addition to other responsibilities typical of the supervisory board of an AG (see description of\nthe procedures of the Supervisory Board), the supervisory board of a KGaA does not have the authority to\nappoint the management board, draw up management board contracts, or specify the compensation of the\nmanagement board. This legal form also involves special features with regard to the Annual General Meeting.\nFor example, in a KGaA, many of the resolutions made require the consent of the general partners (section 285\n(2) AktG), including in particular the adoption of the Annual Financial Statements (section 286 (1) AktG).\nMerck KGaA applies the German Corporate Governance Code analogously where these regulations are\ncompatible with the legal form of a KGaA. In order to enable shareholders to compare the situation at other\ncompanies more easily, we base corporate governance on the conduct recommendations made by the\nGovernment Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code to a broad extent and refrain from\nadopting our own, equally permissible, code. All recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code\nin the version dated December 16, 2019, the intent and meaning of which are applied, have been complied with\nsince the last Declaration of Conformity in February 2022. We will continue to comply with the\nrecommendations of the Code in the version dated April 28, 2022 in the future.\nFor a clearer understanding, the following gives a general explanation of the application of German company\nlaw at Merck KGaA with additional references to the Annual General Meeting and shareholder rights.\nMerck KGaA\nThe general partner E. Merck KG holds around 70% of the total capital of Merck KGaA (equity interest); the\nshareholders hold the remainder, which is divided into shares (share capital). E. Merck KG is excluded from the\nmanagement of business activities. The general partners with no equity interest (Executive Board) manage the\nbusiness activities. Nevertheless, due to its substantial capital investment and unlimited personal liability,\nE. Merck KG has a strong interest in ensuring that the businesses of Merck KGaA operate efficiently in\ncompliance with procedures. Merck KGaA\u2019s participation in the profit/loss of E. Merck KG in accordance with\narticles 26 et seq. of the Articles of Association further harmonizes the interests of the shareholders and of 198\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nE. Merck KG. E. Merck KG appoints and dismisses the Executive Board. In addition, E. Merck KG has created\nbodies \u2013 complementing the expertise and activities of the Supervisory Board \u2013 to monitor and advise the\nExecutive Board. This applies primarily to the Board of Partners of E. Merck KG.\nBased on the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Articles of Association of Merck KGaA, and\nthe rules of procedure of the various committees, Merck KGaA has adopted a set of rules for the Executive\nBoard and its supervision that meet the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code. The\ninvestors, who bear the entrepreneurial risk, are protected as provided for by the German Corporate\nGovernance Code. We take suggestions from the capital market on corporate governance seriously and hold\ndiscussions with investors and shareholder representatives.\nThe General Meeting of Merck KGaA\nThe 27th Annual General Meeting of Merck KGaA was held in Darmstadt, Germany, on April 22, 2022. In\nresponse to the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2022 the Executive Board again decided, with the approval of the\nSupervisory Board, to hold the 2022 Annual General Meeting in virtual form, i.e., without the shareholders and\ntheir proxies attending in person. In doing so, it exercised the option that the legislation again provided in 2022\nin the form of the act on mitigating the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic in civil, insolvency, and\ncriminal procedure law (Gesetz zur Abmilderung der Folgen der Covid-19-Pandemie im Zivil-, Insolvenz- und\nStrafverfahrensrecht). Shareholders and shareholder representatives participated in the Annual General\nMeeting virtually. The meeting was broadcast audiovisually on the Internet in full. At 70.34%, the proportion of\nshare capital represented at the meeting (including postal votes) was slightly higher than in the previous year.\nIn 2021, the proportion of share capital represented was 70.10%. The Annual General Meeting service provider\ndoes not forward voting instructions to Merck in advance of the Annual General Meeting but keeps them in the\nsystem until the count takes place.\nIn particular, the Annual General Meeting passes resolutions concerning the approval of the Annual Financial\nStatements, the appropriation of net retained profit, the approval of the actions of the Executive Board\nmembers and the Supervisory Board members, the election of the auditor, amendments to the Articles of\nAssociation, the compensation system for the Executive Board, and the control and profit and loss transfer\nagreements of Merck KGaA. The shareholders of Merck KGaA exercised their rights at the virtual Annual\nGeneral Meeting using the Internet-based Annual General Meeting system and via a prior question and answer\nprocess. Above and beyond the statutory requirements, this year shareholders were also given the opportunity\nto submit statements on the agenda to the company prior to the Annual General Meeting. These statements\nwere published ahead of the Annual General Meeting and were available for shareholders to view until the end\nof the Annual General Meeting. They were able to exercise their voting rights personally, through an authorized\nrepresentative, or through a proxy appointed by the company. The proxies were in attendance throughout the\nduration of the Annual General Meeting. All the documents and information concerning upcoming General\nMeetings (including a summary explanation of shareholder rights) are also posted on our website. The\nintroductory speech by the Chair of the Executive Board was published in advance on the Internet on April\n11, 2022, in order to make it available to interested shareholders and members of the public and thus satisfy\nthe high transparency requirements of the Merck Group. 199\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nDeclaration of Conformity\nIn accordance with section 161 AktG, applying the provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code\ncorrespondingly, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board issued the following Declaration of Conformity\nwith the recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code:\n\u201cDeclaration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA on the recommendations of the\nGovernment Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to section 161 of the German\nStock Corporation Act (AktG). Since the last Declaration of Conformity in February 2022, we have complied\nwith all recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code in the\nversion dated December 16, 2019 as published in the official section of the German Federal Gazette.\nWith regard to future compliance with the current recommendations of the Government Commission of the\nGerman Corporate Governance Code, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board declare the following: The\ncompany will comply with the recommendations of the Code in the version dated April 28, 2022.\u201d\n\nIt is Merck KGaA\u2019s objective to provide the latest information to all shareholders, media, financial analysts, and\ninterested members of the public, while creating the greatest possible transparency. For this reason, Merck\nuses a wide range of communication platforms to engage in a timely dialog with all interested parties about the\ncompany\u2019s situation and business changes. Merck\u2019s principles include providing factually correct,\ncomprehensive, and fair information.\nInformation subject to disclosure requirements, as well as information that is not, can be accessed worldwide\non the Merck KGaA website (www.merckgroup.com), which is the company\u2019s most important publication\nplatform. In addition to a comprehensive financial calendar, quarterly statements and/or quarterly and half-\nyear financial reports covering at least the past five years are available there in German and English. In line\nwith the legal requirements, ad hoc announcements are also published on the website. These contain\ninformation on circumstances and facts that could impact the Merck share price.\nRegular press conferences, investor meetings on the occasion of investor conferences, and roadshows offer\nanother platform for dialog. The company presentations prepared for this purpose are also available on the\nMerck KGaA website. In addition, the Investor Relations team is available to private and institutional investors\nwho wish to receive further information. To ensure the greatest possible transparency, all documents\nconcerning the General Meeting are available on the company website. Additionally, at least some parts of the\nGeneral Meeting are generally webcast live on the Internet. The Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2022, was\nagain held virtually and hence was webcast live on the Internet in full.\nDealing with insider information\nDealing properly with insider information is very important to us. Our Insider Committee examines the\nexistence of insider information, ensures compliance with legal obligations, and prepares any necessary\nmeasures. The members of the Insider Committee are appointed by the Executive Board; at least two members\nwork in Group Legal & Compliance. The Insider Committee meets at regular intervals or when circumstances\nrequire. The Chief Financial Officer is vested with the authority to make the final decision on handling potential\ninsider information.\nIn order to ensure a high level of protection for insider information, the Executive Board issued internal insider\nguidelines applicable throughout the Merck Group worldwide. The guidelines inform employees about their\nresponsibilities under insider trading laws and give clear instructions for compliant behavior. In addition, they\ndescribe the function of the Insider Committee in detail. Moreover, our Code of Conduct, which is binding for all\nemployees, also contains an explicit, detailed reference to the ban on using insider information. Within the\nscope of obligatory training courses on the Code of Conduct as well as specific training courses on insider law,\nall employees are instructed on the key stipulations of insider trading.\nAccounting and audits of financial statements\nMerck KGaA prepares its consolidated financial statements and Combined Management Report in accordance\nwith the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) effective at the end of the reporting period and\nadopted by the European Union and the additional provisions of section 315e of the German Commercial Code\n(HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report are prepared by the\nExecutive Board and examined by an auditor, taking into account the German generally accepted standards for\nthe audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer, IDW).\nThe Supervisory Board commissioned KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, to audit the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report for 2022. KPMG AG 201\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, is obliged to inform the Supervisory Board without delay of any grounds\nfor disqualification or bias occurring during the audit if these cannot be immediately rectified. Additionally, the\nauditor shall immediately report to the Supervisory Board any findings and issues that emerge during the audit\nthat have a direct bearing upon the tasks of the Supervisory Board. The auditor shall inform the Supervisory\nBoard or note in the audit report any circumstances determined during the audit that would render inaccurate\nthe Declaration of Conformity made by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. It has also been agreed\nwith the auditor that in order to assess whether the Executive Board has fulfilled its obligations in accordance\nwith section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the audit will also cover the company\u2019s early\nwarning risk identification system. Moreover, the auditor is required to examine and evaluate the accounting-\nrelevant internal control system insofar as this is necessary and appropriate for assessing the accuracy of\nfinancial reporting.\nSince 1995, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, has been the auditing firm responsible for the\nstatutory audit of the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA. The\nauditor responsible for auditing the Consolidated Financial Statements changes regularly. Dirk Janz is currently\nleading the audit engagement. Mr. Janz has been the auditor in charge of the engagement since fiscal 2020.\nKPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, has assured the company that it is independent of the group\nentities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law,\nand that it has fulfilled its other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nThe Supervisory Board has found no grounds to doubt the independence of KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs-\ngesellschaft, Berlin. Neither party identified any conflicts of interest. The Audit Committee reviews the quality of\nthe audit, including the performance of the auditor in charge of the engagement, annually on the basis of\nobjective indicators.\nDue to the requirement to change auditors at regular intervals, Merck KGaA must appoint a new auditor\n(different than the current one) no later than for fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2019, the Supervisory Board of\nMerck KGaA therefore decided to prepare a public request for tender for the audit of the Annual Financial\nStatements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA, and to voluntarily change auditors for the\nfiscal 2023 audit, earlier than required. The public request for tender was published in the German Federal\nGazette in February 2020. Based on this request for tender, the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA resolved at\nits meeting on July 30, 2021, to propose to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte GmbH\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Munich, be elected as the auditor of the Annual Financial Statements and\nConsolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA for fiscal 2023. The Annual General Meeting followed this\nproposal on April 22, 2022 and elected Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Munich, as the auditor\nof the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA for fiscal 2023.\nFurther reports\nThe combined management report of Merck KGaA and the Merck Group includes the compensation report and a\ncombined non-financial declaration. The latter incorporates the non-financial declaration of the Merck Group in\naccordance with section 315b HGB and the non-financial declaration of Merck KGaA in accordance with 289b\nHGB and section 315b (1) HGB in conjunction with section 298 (2) HGB. It is included as a separate chapter of\nthe management report. An overview of the information contained in the combined non-financial declaration\ncan be found at \u201cTopics for the non-financial statement\u201d. In addition, Merck publishes a sustainability report\nthat meets the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and contains reports in\naccordance with the standards published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This will be available from April 13, 2023, as an online\nversion on the company\u2019s website at https://www.merckgroup.com/en/sustainability-report/2022. The\nreport on equality and equal pay pursuant to sections 21, 22 of the German Act on the Promotion of Pay\nTransparency between Women and Men is attached to the combined management report and published in the\ncompanies register. It is available at https://www.merckgroup.com/en/investors/corporate-\ngovernance/reports.html. 202\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nValues and compliance\nFirst and foremost, responsible entrepreneurship means acting in accordance with the law \u2013 also known as\ncompliance. All our activities are required to adhere to the applicable laws, regulations, and international ethical\nstandards around the world. Compliance violations would result not only in possible legal action but also could\nseriously compromise our reputation as an employer and business partner.\nOur Group Compliance function is responsible for the core topics: Merck\u2019s Code of Conduct, anti-corruption and\nanti-bribery (including healthcare compliance, third-party due diligence, transparency reporting), anti-money\nlaundering, antitrust and conflict of interest. Group-wide and local policies, procedures, and processes are in\nplace for these important compliance topics in order to ensure that our business activities are consistent with\nthe relevant laws, regulations, and international ethical standards.\nOur compliance management system encompasses eight core elements and ongoing consultation with the\nbusiness fields that make up our compliance portfolio:\nElements of our compliance program\nLiving our values together is the underlying principle of our compliance management system. The Compliance\ndepartment adopts a specific brief in this respect.\nA global framework for ethical and legally compliant business processes serves to minimize risk. We achieve\nthis by identifying specific compliance risks and requirements. Suitable policies and effective controls are\nimplemented in order to reduce risk. Our goals also focus on our employees: It is up to us. This serves to\nstrengthen employees\u2019 sense of responsibility and accountability. We achieve this by informing employees\nabout the applicable compliance rules and ethical standards and by giving them the responsibility for complying\nwith these requirements. As compliance is the second line of defense against risks, it is important that we\nconsistently safeguard what really matters. This is why we regularly monitor key indicators that allow us to\nassess risks and the effectiveness of controls. Compliance not only contributes to company growth but also\ncreates targeted value added by allowing us to advise the business sectors and help them to navigate the\nrespective compliance requirements. Our advice takes into account and adapts to changing business\nrequirements. 203\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nBased on a corporate culture that places the fundamental company values \u2013 courage, achievement,\nresponsibility, respect, integrity, and transparency \u2013 at the center of our entrepreneurial actions, our Code of\nConduct (http://www.merckgroup.com/company/responsibility/en/regulations-and-guidelines/code-of-\nconduct.pdf) helps us implement these when dealing with one another daily.\nWith its Code of Conduct, Merck has established a set of rules intended to help our employees to act\nresponsibly and to make the right decisions in their daily work. The Code of Conduct applies to all Merck\nemployees in all countries and at all levels of our organization.\nIt explains the company principles for dealings with business associates, shareholders, colleagues, and\nemployees, and within the scope of our responsibility for society. Therefore, it supports all employees in acting\nethically \u2013 not only in their dealings with one another but also outside the company. Accordingly, the Code of\nConduct is also the main set of rules for our Compliance Program. Merck has aligned the content of its Code of\nConduct with the Merck values and integrated important topics such as data privacy, healthcare compliance,\nand bioethics. To Merck, compliance means observing legal and internal regulations and the basic ethical\nprinciples anchored in the company\u2019s values. With the Code of Conduct and the various unit-specific ethical\ncompliance rules, the values are integrated into daily work and business practice. We also expect our business\nassociates (e.g. customers, suppliers, distributors etc.) worldwide to accept these principles or to have their\nown comparable principles. While supplier management ensures compliant behavior of suppliers, global\nbusiness partner risk management encompasses the relations with sales-related business associates such as\ndistributors and wholesalers.\nThe Compliance department monitors observance of the Code of Conduct with support from corresponding\nmonitoring and training programs throughout the company. Suitable controls and tailored training programs\nacross the company ensure monitoring of the Code of Conduct. All employees are called upon to report\npotential compliance violations to their supervisor, Legal, HR, or other relevant departments or via the\nCompliance hotline. In cooperation with Group Internal Auditing, the Compliance Office regularly reviews the\nimplementation of Group-wide compliance measures at the subsidiaries. The audits regularly focus on the local\ncompliance structure, the compliance measures taken, and the existence of corresponding compliance\nguidelines and processes.\nThe Group Compliance Officer is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and further development of\nour global Compliance Management System. Among other things, the Group Compliance Officer and its team,\nconsisting of a global Compliance Center of Expertise and Compliance Officers, take appropriate measures to\nhelp lower the risk of serious compliance violations and implement the compliance program across Merck\nglobally. Our Compliance Center of Expertise is a central body responsible for designing and structuring our\ncompliance program in all business areas and Group functions.\nOur Group Compliance Officer reports on the status of our compliance activities, potential risks and serious\ncompliance violations to the Executive Board and Audit Committee twice a year at a minimum. As part of our\nregular reporting processes, we compile a comprehensive compliance and data privacy report annually for the\nExecutive Board. This includes the status of our compliance program, continuous improvement initiatives and\nkey figures on compliance and data privacy cases. Additionally, we prepare a mid-year update to highlight\nongoing developments and the status of relevant projects and initiatives.\nA further focus area of the Compliance Program is ensuring legally and ethically correct dealings with medical\nstakeholders and adhering to the transparency requirements. The Compliance organization has agreed on\nextensive measures with the affected areas of the company in order to establish an internal framework of rules\nas well as the corresponding processes for approving and documenting interactions with healthcare\nprofessionals that ensure Merck complies with reporting obligations. We, of course, also ensure compliance with\nthe respectively valid data protection regulations.\nThe importance of compliance is also reflected in the subsidiaries, which ensure via country representatives that\ncompliance measures are implemented in the countries. Compliance tasks in the countries and on a regional\nbasis are largely performed by full-time compliance officers. As a result, a higher level of compliance expertise 204\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nis based locally, and the growing number of tasks in all business sectors are taken into account. The compliance\nofficers in the countries and regions report to the dedicated compliance officers for the respective business\nsectors (Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics). A separate responsibility was also created for Group\nfunctions. Regular regional and global compliance meetings are held to promote the exchange of information\nwithin the Compliance organization. This is supplemented by a global concept for local compliance forums and\nglobal compliance committees, at which relevant compliance-related topics are discussed with senior\nmanagement. These constitute an important element of risk assessment and quality assurance.\nNewcomer trainings are run for newly appointed compliance officers. These seminars serve to build up\ncompliance expertise and strengthen cooperation within the Compliance organization. This Group-wide network\nis used to steer the global Compliance Program. The Compliance organization is also involved in the relevant\ndue diligence processes for the incorporation of new business units as well as possible divestments and\nacquisitions, and the subsequent integration of companies. Within the scope of the global compliance program,\na high degree of importance is given to regular compliance trainings of the Merck Compliance Training Plan,\nwhich are conducted as web-based training courses and classroom sessions. The various training topics\naddressed, particularly on the Code of Conduct, anti-corruption and bribery, conflicts of interest, anti-money\nlaundering, antitrust and competition law, and healthcare compliance, serve to sensitize employees and\nmanagement on the consequences of compliance violations. Since Merck set up a central Compliance hotline,\nour employees and individuals outside of our company have been able to report compliance violations by\ntelephone or via a web-based application in their respective language. The Compliance hotline is available 24\nhours a day, free of charge. Case numbers enable anonymous, two-way communication. The reports received\nare individually reviewed. If a compliance violation exists, corresponding corrective measures are taken based\non concrete action plans. If necessary, disciplinary measures are taken which can range from a simple verbal\nwarning up to the dismissal of the employee who violated a compliance rule. Merck has set up a Compliance\nCase Committee to guide these processes. The Compliance Case Committee consists of senior members from\nvarious Group governance functions; they are involved in reviewing compliance violations and introducing\ncountermeasures. The joint work in the Compliance Case Committee enables processes between the various\nGroup functions to be optimally coordinated and designed efficiently.\nData Privacy\nGroup Data Privacy at Merck is integrated into the Group\u2019s Compliance organization. As required by law, this\ndepartment operates independently and without being required to follow instructions. The department regularly\nprepares Data Privacy updates and produces a comprehensive Data Privacy report at regular intervals as part of\nour broader compliance reporting efforts. The Group Data Privacy Officer has a team currently comprising\naround 20 employees who work around the world as local Data Privacy Officers. Other individuals around the\nworld also perform as local Data Privacy Officers alongside their primary activity for Merck. A Center of\nExpertise also provides support in the form of structures and tools. 205\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nOur Data Privacy Management System encompasses various elements of our portfolio alongside the pillars of\npeople and communication. The portfolio is composed as follows:\nElements of our Data Privacy program\nThe Data Privacy organization has put specific guidelines in place in order to ensure that Data Privacy processes\ncomply with the relevant regulations. The \u201dGroup Data Privacy Policy\u201d defines the standards according to which\ndata is processed, stored, used, and transmitted at Merck. This enables us to provide a high level of privacy\nwhen it comes to processing the data of our employees, contract partners, customers, suppliers, patients,\nhealthcare practitioners, and participants in clinical trials. The statutory documentation requirements are\nrealized in a central IT tool that also serves as the basis for key Data Privacy processes: documenting\nprocessing activities, defining the Local Data Privacy Officers, documenting video recordings and surveillance,\nand processing potential data privacy violations. Our understanding of Data Privacy throughout the Group is\nbased on European legislation in particular, including the data privacy principles of the EU\u2019s General Data\nProtection Regulation (EU GDPR), which has been in force since May 2018. However, we also comply with and\nimplement local data privacy regulations.\nRisk and opportunity management\nSystematic and responsible risk and opportunities management is a key aspect of corporate governance for\nMerck. Merck\u2019s company-wide risk management, compliance and control system is based on the \u201cthree-lines of\ndefense\u201d model, which describes the interlinked risk structures and responsibilities at various levels.\nAt the first level (1st line), activities (including the management of financial and non-financial risks) and the use\nof resources are managed in line with external and internal regulations. Risks are to be prevented/recorded and\nreduced where they could arise, i.e. at operational level. Risk owners, i.e. the heads of the business fields, the\nmanaging directors of the Merck subsidiaries and the heads of the Group Functions, establish processes in\naccordance with the requirements of the second level (2nd line) to ensure that risk mitigation measures can be\nidentified, assessed, monitored and developed. Through the heads of the business fields and Group Functions,\nplanned, actual and expected results in connection with the organization\u2019s goals and risks are regularly\ndiscussed with the Executive Board.\nThe second level (2nd Line) sets the framework for the design of the internal control system, the risk\nmanagement system and the compliance management system by defining appropriate minimum requirements\nfor governance, systems and processes to be applied in the 1st line. The specific structure of this governance is\nrisk-based and at the discretion of the Executive Board. The Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the 206\nCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance\nSupervisory Board receive regular reports on risk management, the financial internal control system and\ncompliance. For further information on governance and the processes in place for risk management, compliance\nmanagement and the financial internal control system, please see the \u201cRisk and Opportunity Report\u201d and the\nsection \u201cValues and compliance\u201d in the Statement on Corporate Governance.\nAt the third level (3rd line), the Internal Auditing Group function monitors the accuracy, security,\nappropriateness and effectiveness of existing governance and processes, internal controls and risk management\nusing independent audits. These are covered by the risk-based annual audit plan or, in individual cases, ad-hoc\naudits during the year. It helps the Executive Board perform its monitoring function and reports directly and\nindependently to the Executive Board. The independence of Internal Auditing ensures that both the planning\nand execution of its work are not subject to obstacles or bias, as well as guaranteeing unrestricted access to\nthe persons, resources and information required. The head of Internal Auditing reports activities and results to\nthe Executive Board at least once a quarter or, where required, on an ad hoc basis, and also reports to the\nAudit Committee twice a year. Internal Auditing itself undergoes an external quality audit every five years. A\nquality audit was conducted in fiscal 2022.\nThe \u201cthree-lines-of-defense\u201d model is supplemented in terms of accounting by the activities of the external\nauditor. With the \u201cthree-lines-of-defense\u201d model described, the Executive Board has implemented a governance\nframework for Merck that aims to ensure appropriate, effective internal control and risk management. The\nmeasures put in place in this context are also designed to ensure that internal control, compliance and risk\nmanagement are effective and appropriate and are discussed, for example, in the Risk and Opportunity Report\nin the combined management report. Independent monitoring and audits are also carried out as part of\nimplementing the \u201cthree-lines-of-defense\u201d model and the statutory framework, in particular through the audits\nby Internal Auditing described and other external audits. In particular, the pace at which requirements for non-\nfinancial reporting and non-financial risks change makes it necessary to regularly review and, where necessary,\nadjust the monitoring systems for this area.\nRelevant Group functions and representatives from the business fields reported on the control systems in place\nto the Executive Board in 2022. In this context, areas where potential for improvement and optimization had\nbeen identified and relevant ongoing projects were also presented to the Executive Board. Finally, the individual\nfunctions and business fields issued an assessment to the Executive Board of the appropriateness and\neffectiveness of the control system, where applicable taking account of recommended improvement\nopportunities. Based on this, the review of the non-financial internal control system and reporting by Internal\nAuditing, as of December 31, 2022 the Executive Board was not aware of any indications with regard to\nmaterial issues that the system is not appropriate or effective. Given the multi-layered process landscape and\nthe high speed of change regarding the catalog of requirements for non-financial information, the maturity of\nthe non-financial internal control system does not yet match that of the (Group) accounting-related internal\ncontrol system. Based on regular reviews of the financial internal control system, compliance and risk\nmanagement and reporting by Internal Auditing, as of December 31, 2022 the Executive Board was not aware\nof any indications with regard to material issues that this system is not appropriate or effective.\n\n\nThe image provides an overview of the capital structure and corporate governance bodies of Merck KGaA.

This structure ensures proper oversight, management, and shareholder involvement in the company\u2019s governance.\nThe image illustrates a detailed structure of a compliance management system, organized in a circular infographic with eight interconnected segments, each representing a core component of the system. This model highlights how each aspect contributes to a holistic compliance strategy, emphasizing the program's comprehensive nature and its integral role within the organization. Here's a breakdown of each component as shown in the infographic:\n\n### Central Diagram\n- The central wheel is divided into eight numbered segments, each depicting a different element of the compliance program:\n  1. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies internal and external critical risks in regular business operations.\n  2. **Policies & Procedures**: Establishes global policies and procedures to mitigate identified risks.\n  3. **Compliance Committee / Forum**: Serves as a platform for compliance-related discussion and decision-making, including relevant key functions.\n  4. **Training & Awareness**: Focuses on training and additional measures to educate and keep awareness high.\n  5. **Business Counseling**: Described as a core activity, it provides daily cross- and sector-specific advice.\n  6. **Monitoring & Reporting**: Involves tracking compliance-related data and performing both internal and external reporting.\n  7. **Case Management**: Ensures timely responses to reports of misconduct and the implementation of corrective actions.\n  8. **Programs & Tools**: Details comprehensive compliance programs and supporting tools that contribute to internal controls and overall governance.\n\n### Additional Elements\n- **Continuous Improvement**: This is noted at the top of the diagram, stressing that all compliance program elements are based on and contribute to continuous improvement.\n- **Living our values together is the underlying principle of our compliance management system**: This statement underscores that the compliance department adopts a specific brief to embody and promote corporate values through the compliance management system.\n\n### Overall Design\n- The diagram uses a color gradient of teal and pink shades to differentiate between the various segments, making it visually appealing and easy to differentiate between the components.\n- The layout suggests a systematic and dynamic approach to compliance management, with all components being interconnected, signifying the interdependence and importance of each aspect in maintaining robust compliance standards.\n\nThis infographic is likely used internally for training or orientation purposes to help employees understand their roles within the compliance framework and how various components of the system work together to maintain corporate integrity and legal compliance.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

Merck maintains defined roles and duties, makes sure the right resources and skills are available, and sets goals that are in line with employee input. At least twice a year, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board receive reports from the Chief Compliance Officer regarding the state of compliance efforts, possible threats, and significant infractions of the law. Merck initiated this programme to enhance objectivity and provide a more data-driven risk strategy by introducing a worldwide compliance risk framework for all business sectors. \n- Furthermore, they developed a thorough risk matrix with an emphasis on bribery and corruption threats, which is demonstrated by elaborate risk classification and risk scenarios. \\n- Merck often offers online training programmes and compliance classrooms covering topics such as healthcare compliance requirements, data protection, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, antitrust, and the Code of Conduct. \n- Depending on their level of risk exposure, Merck needs its workers to complete these courses. Certain courses are also applicable to workers who are under supervision, like temporary employees, and independent contractors.\n- Two anti-corruption and anti-money laundering standards were distributed to senior management through internal communication channels in 2022 as part of our focused awareness programmes.  Additionally, they update and modify training curriculum frequently to reflect new information. \n- All workers at Merck are forced to report any possible infractions of compliance to their managers, legal counsel, human resources, or other pertinent departments. Globally, they can also report infractions in their local language via phone or through an online application by using our central whistleblowing compliance hotline, which is anonymous and free of charge. The Compliance Investigations and Case Management team reviews reports of possible compliance violations that they receive through the compliance hotline. Employees who have violated compliance policies may face appropriate disciplinary action based on the findings of the inquiry and recommendations made by the Compliance Case Committee or the Compliance inquiry Team. Merck takes preventive and corrective action if a root cause that may increase the likelihood of future compliance violations is found during the inquiry. This arrangement secures an independent examination.\nExternal stakeholders can also reach the compliance hotline. The Compliance and Ethics section of our website contains the pertinent information. \n-Employees take required online courses and in-person training on our policies and procedures, as well as significant modifications to the reporting requirements for transfers of value, in order to stay informed about their duties and responsibilities and to stay up to date.

Thanks to its technological edge, balanced portfolio and broad customer base, MTU is well-positioned for continues growth in the future. The following sections contain the Supervisory Board\u2019s report on its activities in fiscal year 2022. The Supervisory Board will continue its close and trustful collaboration with all stakeholders in 2023.\nActivities of the Supervisory Board\nIn this report, the Supervisory Board provides information in accordance with Section 171 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) on its activities in fiscal 2022 and the results of its review of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. In 2022, the Su- pervisory Board carried out, fully and with due care, the duties of oversight and advice entrusted to it by law, the articles of association, and its own rules of procedure.\nIt regularly advised the Executive Board on the running\nof the company, continually supported and monitored\nthe management of the business activities and assured itself that the Executive Board\u2019s dealings were proper\nand lawful. The Supervisory Board was informed and consulted in a direct and timely manner on all decisions\nof consequence for the company. The Executive Board pro- vided the members of the Supervisory Board with regular, prompt and comprehensive information on the company\u2019s situation. The Supervisory Board received written monthly reports on the company\u2019s net assets, financial position\nand results of operations. At its meetings, the Supervisory Board also discussed the business performance of all of MTU\u2019s affiliated companies.\nThe Supervisory Board discussed the strategy and all important projects with the Executive Board. After exam- ination and careful deliberation, the Supervisory Board endorsed the company\u2019s strategic orientation with its focus on sustainable and profitable organic and sustain- able growth. The Supervisory Board passed resolutions on all transactions for which its approval was required in accordance with the law, the company\u2019s articles of association or the Executive Board\u2019s rules of procedure after reviewing and discussing them with the Executive Board. Preparatory meetings can also take place without the Executive Board as necessary. Moreover, the Super- visory Board regularly schedules meetings without the Executive Board.\nIn 2022, as in previous years, the Supervisory Board examined and oversaw the internal control mechanisms at MTU, especially the risk management system, internal auditing and legally compliant corporate governance. It examined these systems with the support of the Audit\n  / Report of the Supervisory Board\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 10\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommittee and in dialogue with the Executive Board and reached the conclusion that the company has implement- ed them effectively; in particular there is an effective internal control and risk management system for the accounting process. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board looked extensively at the company\u2019s compliance. In addition, the change of auditor for the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2023 was the subject of intensive deliberation.\nIn view of the legal requirements for stock corporations, which impose an obligation to obtain the consent of the Supervisory Board for certain related party transactions, the Supervisory Board adopted an internal procedure to comply with these requirements in 2020. In the report- ing period, there were no transactions requiring consent or disclosure.\nMeetings of the Supervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board held five routine meetings and two extraordinary meetings in 2022. Two meetings were held in hybrid format: some members of the Supervisory Board attended in person while others participated by video con- ference. The members took part in all meetings, with the exception of one member, who was unable to participate in the two extraordinary meetings. Attendance was therefore 98.5%.\n[T2] Supervisory Board members\u2019 attendance at meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nAt its meeting on March 8, 2022 the Supervisory Board discussed MTU\u2019s Annual Report. The Supervisory Board adopted the annual financial statements and the consol- idated financial statements and approved the combined management report for the company and the Group for fiscal 2021. In addition, it looked in detail at the alloca- tion of the net profit for 2021 available for distribution and approved the Executive Board\u2019s profit distribution proposal. A dividend payment of \u20ac2.10 per share eligible for the dividend was therefore proposed to the Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2022. The Supervisory Board approved the non-financial statement for the MTU Group and the company for fiscal 2021. Further, it discussed the appointment of the auditor and submitted a proposal to the Annual General Meeting that Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft should be appointed\nto audit the annual financial statements and consoli- dated financial statements for fiscal 2022. Other issues examined by the Supervisory Board were the short-term incentive (STI) payable to the members of the Executive Board for 2021 and the definition of financial and non-fi- nancial targets for the award of STI payments to Execu- tive Board members for 2022. Furthermore a resolution was adopted on amendment of the Supervisory Board\u2019s rules of procedure. The report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting and the agenda for the meeting were also agreed on. Furthermore, the Super- visory Board approved the management compensation report and the corporate governance statement.\nAt its meeting on April 8, 2022, the Supervisory Board looked in detail at the company\u2019s situation and the impact of the war in Ukraine on MTU\u2019s business. The Executive Board also reported in detail to the Supervi- sory Board on the preliminary quarterly figures for the first quarter.\nAt the meeting on May 4, 2022, the Supervisory Board unanimously approved Reiner Winkler\u2019s request to rend his period of service as a member of the Executive Board and CEO as of the end of December 31, 2022. Moreover, it unanimously decided to appoint Lars Wagner as CEO of MTU effective January 1, 2023.\nAs part of its regular sustainability reporting, at the meeting on July 26, 2022, the Executive Board provid- ed extensive information on MTU\u2019s progress towards emission-free flying. An important topic in this context was fuel cells in combination with sustainably produced hydrogen. Further, the Supervisory Board discussed in detail the strategic planning presented by the Executive Board. The focus was on key aspects of the planned participation in future engine programs, the plans for sustainable aviation and the proposed investments in MTU\u2019s network of companies. Digitalization was also discussed at length.\n \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAt an extraordinary meeting on September 28, 2022,\nthe Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Silke Maurer to the Executive Board of MTU for a term of three years starting on February 1, 2023. As the Executive Board member responsible for OEM Operations, she is the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). The Supervisory Board also resolved on the adjustment of the allocation of responsibilities among the Executive Board members effective February 1, 2023.\nAt its meeting on October 26, 2022, the Supervisory Board resolved that it would submit a proposal to the Annual General Meeting that KPMG be appointed as the new auditor for the annual financial statements and con- solidated financial statements for fiscal 2023. This was preceded by a multi-step tender and selection process, which was performed by the Audit Committee and led to the recommendation on the appointment of KPMG as the auditor. In addition, the Executive Board provided infor- mation in a focus report on the strategy, status and out- look for the MRO business and the future development of MTU Maintenance Zhuhai. A summary of the results of the review of the efficiency of the Supervisory Board was presented and it was decided to hold a workshop for the Supervisory Board in February 2023 to work on them.\nAt the meeting held on December 13, 2022, the Super- visory Board undertook a detailed examination of the operational business plans and budget for 2023. The meeting also included a detailed review and confirma- tion of the management\u2019s compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. Other topics discussed were MTU\u2019s sustainability strategy and the compensation of the Executive Board, especially the status of achievement of the ESG targets set for 2022. As recommended by\nthe Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board also resolved that at the Annual General Meeting it would put forward Ute Wolf, former Chief Financial Officer of Evonik Industries AG, as a candidate for the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board approved the Executive Board\u2019s decision to hold the Annual General Meeting 2023 as a virtual meeting.\nAt its meetings, the Supervisory Board also discussed the legal requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code regarding Executive Board compensation. The compensation system takes account of sustainability targets and provides for appro- priate and motivating compensation.\nBetween official meetings, the Chairman of the Super- visory Board was regularly briefed on the company\u2019s current situation, significant business transactions\nand important pending decisions. This entailed regular meetings with the Executive Board, including consulting on strategy, the status of planning, the progress of busi- ness, the company\u2019s risk situation, the risk management system and compliance.\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nCorporate governance\nThe Supervisory Board is convinced that MTU\u2019s suc- cess is based, among other factors, on good corporate governance. For this reason, in 2022 the Supervisory Board once again looked in detail at the application and implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code, based on the current version of April 28, 2022. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board regularly discusses the composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board with a view to diversity and the appropriate inclu- sion of women.\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s rules of procedure contain binding provisions for dealing with conflicts of interest. Such conflicts must be disclosed and, where appropriate, may result in termination of the member\u2019s term of office. This also applies for proposals for election submitted to the Annual General Meeting. There were no conflicts of interest in the reporting period. With the exception of\na consulting agreement between a Supervisory Board member and one of the company\u2019s suppliers, there were no consulting agreements, contracts for services or similar contractual agreements between members of the Supervisory Board and MTU Aero Engines AG or any of its subsidiaries, or with customers, suppliers, lenders\nor other third parties in 2022. If there are any discus- sions or resolutions affecting this supplier in future, the Supervisory Board member concerned will not take part in them. There were no such discussions or resolutions in the reporting period.\nThe Supervisory Board also undertook a detailed ex- amination of the recommendations of the GCGC on the independence of the members representing the share- holders. The Supervisory Board deems all of its members to be independent. This expressly applies to the employ- ee representatives and to Dr. Rainer Martens, who ceased to be a member of MTU\u2019s Executive Board at the end of 2017. Moreover, it applies to Dr. J\u00fcrgen M. Gei\u00dfinger\nand Dr. Joachim Rauhut, who have been members of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years. Consequently, all Supervisory Board committees consist exclusively of independent members. The Supervisory Board has set four terms of office as the maximum for membership of the Supervisory Board and considers this to be appropri- ate for MTU. Members of the Supervisory Board under- take training on their own responsibility, with support from MTU where necessary. MTU may also defray the costs of training. In fiscal 2022, MTU provided support by arranging presentations on Germany\u2019s Second Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions (F\u00fcPoG II), the German Act on Strengthening Financial Market Integrity (FISG) and on developments in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\nIn consultation with the Executive Board, the Supervi- sory Board ensures long-term succession planning for\n/ Report of the Supervisory Board\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 12\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nappointments to the Executive Board. To this end, the Supervisory Board regularly reviews the present term of all Executive Board contracts, taking into account, in all cases, the age of each member and the competency profile of potential candidates.\nThere is an onboarding process for new members of the Supervisory Board. This gives them a thorough insight into MTU\u2019s product portfolio, strategy, corporate gover- nance and how the Supervisory Board works.\nThe Supervisory Board regularly assesses how effectively the Supervisory Board as a whole and its committees perform their tasks. In 2022, the Supervisory Board con- ducted a self-assessment of the work in plenary session, with the aid of an external consultant. This took the form of a questionnaire and individual interviews with each Supervisory Board member and the Executive Board. The topics covered included, in particular, strategy, structures and processes, culture, composition, leadership and ESG. Benchmarking against a selected peer group of companies was also used. The results were discussed with the Super- visory Board at a separate workshop. They form the basis for the ongoing development of the work of the Superviso- ry Board and its profile of skills and expertise as well as for the final assessment by the Supervisory Board, that its work was, and still is, performed efficiently.\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee also performed anoth-\ner self-assessment. This comprised a questionnaire developed by an external firm of lawyers. The focal areas of this self-assessment were the qualifications and organization of the committee and oversight of financial reporting and auditing, and the internal auditing and risk management system. The Audit Committee also assessed its efficiency as good in 2022.\nCooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, and among the members of the Supervi- sory Board, in the past fiscal year was judged to be very good. No conflicts of interest arose between MTU and any member of its Executive Board or Supervisory Board.\nIn a joint declaration with the Executive Board dated De- cember 13, 2022, in accordance with the requirements of Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board states that MTU Aero Engines AG complies with all the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the version\ndated April 28, 2022. This declaration of conformity is reproduced in this Annual Report in the section of the management report headed \u201cCorporate governance state- ment,\u201d together with a more detailed description of the company\u2019s corporate governance system. The declaration has also been posted on the MTU website. In addition, the company observes all suggestions made in the German Corporate Governance Code.\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nCommittee meetings\nBy convention, the Supervisory Board has three commit- tees with equal numbers of employee and shareholder representatives: an Audit Committee, a Personnel Com- mittee and \u2013 in compliance with Section 27 (3) of the German Codetermination Act (MitbestG) \u2013 a Mediation Committee. Each of these committees presents regular reports on its activities at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board.\nA Nomination Committee, which meets on an ad hoc basis, has been set up in accordance with the recom- mendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The task of the Nomination Committee is to find suitable candidates for election to the Supervisory Board. Its members are Gordon Riske (Chairman, since May 5, 2022) / Klaus Eberhardt (until May 4, 2022) and Dr. J\u00fcrgen M. Gei\u00dfinger. In 2022, the Nomination Committee held one meeting in the form of a video conference.\nThe Personnel Committee comprises Gordon Riske (Chairman, since May 5, 2022) / Klaus Eberhardt (until May 4, 2022), Dr. J\u00fcrgen M. Gei\u00dfinger and two employ- ee representatives, Josef Mailer and Roberto Armellini (until July 31, 2022) / Danielle Frijia (since August 17, 2022). Among other things, it deals with the employment contracts of Executive Board members, including their compensation and the recommendation of candidates. The Personnel Committee convened four times in 2022, with one meeting held in hybrid format (with some mem- bers attending in person while others took part by video link; the total attendance rate at meetings of the commit- tee was 93.8% as one member was unable to attend an extraordinary meeting). Issues examined included the short-term incentive (STI) payable to the members of the Executive Board for 2021, the definition of targets for\nthe award of STI payments to Executive Board members for 2022, including the targets and bandwidths for the ESG criteria, and the recommendation to the Supervisory Board for the appointment and compensation of mem- bers of the Executive Board.\nThe Mediation Committee, whose members are identical with those of the Personnel Committee, did not have to convene in 2022.\nThe members of the Audit Committee are Dr. Joachim Rauhut (Chairman), Dr. Christine Bortenl\u00e4nger, Heike Madan and Josef Mailer. It held six routine meetings and one extraordinary meeting in the year under review. Two of the meetings were video conferences and one was held in hybrid format (some members attended in person, others took part via video link). Attendance was 100%.\nThe Audit Committee focused on reviewing the annual fi- nancial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, including the\n    / Report of the Supervisory Board\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 13\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nnon-financial statement of the MTU Group and MTU Aero Engines AG as well as the company\u2019s net assets, financial position and results of operations, and the annual and half-year reports and quarterly statements. In addition, it prepared the Supervisory Board\u2019s proposal to the Annual General Meeting on the appointment of the auditor. Further, it was responsible for engaging the auditor,\nthe agreement with the auditor on the audit fees, and for specifying the key areas of focus for the audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for 2022.\nThe Audit Committee oversaw the quality of the audit and the independence of the auditor. To this end, it obtained the auditor\u2019s statement of independence in ac- cordance with Section 107 (3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\nFurthermore, the Audit Committee discussed the addi- tional services provided by the auditor. The procedure for procuring the non-audit services provided by the audi- tors was reviewed and affirmed and the content and fees for such services in the reporting period were approved on a case-by-case basis.\nAt four of its seven meetings and through additional direct discussions between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the auditor, the Audit Committee ob- tained reports from the auditor on its audit strategy and approach, the audit process, especially its effectiveness and progress, and the results of the audit, and asked crit- ical questions. Moreover, it examined the qualification of the persons engaged to conduct the audit and the audi- tor\u2019s general quality assurance concept and its practical application. During the reporting period, the committee supplemented this with publicly available information on the quality controls performed by the auditor and its competitors.\nThe committee and other members of the Supervisory Board received the audit reports from Ernst & Young for their deliberations. These documents were reviewed in detail in the presence of the auditor. On this basis, the committee recommended that the Supervisory Board should adopt the financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2022, and approve the combined management report and the Executive Board\u2019s profit distribution proposal.\nIn accordance with statutory requirements, the Au-\ndit Committee monitored the accounting process, the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and the internal auditing system, which it judged to be effective. It oversaw the company\u2019s compliance activities and received reports from the internal auditors. The Audit Committee received reports from the heads of\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nthe Corporate Audit and Compliance unit and on related party transactions. No material weaknesses were estab- lished in the internal control system for the accounting process or system for early identification of risks.\nOther items examined by the Audit Committee were the tender for the audit engagement, including recommend- ing a candidate to the Supervisory Board, the EMIR audit for fiscal 2021, MTU\u2019s currency hedging model, aircraft financing and the current status of ongoing campaigns. In addition, the committee obtained an update on the status of non-financial reporting and the organization of accounting and on the ongoing development of the risk management system and the internal control system.\nAdoption of the annual financial statements, the approved consolidated financial statements and the management report\nThe annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and combined management report of the MTU Group and MTU Aero Engines AG for 2022 were audited by Ernst & Young, Munich, whose appointment was approved by the Annual General Meeting. Ernst & Young issued an unqualified audit opinion. This was signed by Christian Baur and Gerhard Stummer, who have audited MTU since 2021 and 2020, respectively. The audit reports and documents to be reviewed were submitted in good time to all members of the Superviso- ry Board. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on the audit performed by Ernst & Young. On this basis, the Supervisory Board conducted a thorough review of the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, including the non-finan- cial statement of the MTU Group and MTU Aero Engines AG for 2022 and the Executive Board\u2019s proposal for the distribution of the net profit. The auditor attended the meeting of the Audit Committee of MTU Aero Engines AG on March 14, 2023, and the meeting held by the Super- visory Board on March 21, 2023 to discuss the financial statements, and presented the main findings of the audit. The Supervisory Board reviewed the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements, combined management report including the non-financial state- ment, and the profit distribution proposal, and raised\nno objections. The company\u2019s annual financial state- ments and consolidated financial statements for 2022, as submitted by the Executive Board, were approved at the Supervisory Board\u2019s meeting on March 21, 2023. The annual financial statements are therefore adopted. The Supervisory Board agreed to the Executive Board\u2019s proposal for the distribution of the net profit after giving due consideration to the interests of the company and its shareholders. A dividend payment of \u20ac3.20 per share\n/ Report of the Supervisory Board\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 14\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\neligible for the dividend will therefore be proposed to the Annual General Meeting.\nChanges in the governing bodies\nWith the agreement of the Supervisory Board, the company\u2019s CEO, Reiner Winkler, terminated his contract at year-end 2022 for personal reasons. The Supervisory Board thanks Reiner Winkler, who played a key role during more than two decades and has ensured that MTU is now an extremely well-positioned company with excellent future prospects. Lars Winkler, Chief Operating Officer, was appointed unanimously as new CEO effective January 1, 2023. Dr. Silke Maurer became the new Chief Operating Officer (COO) on February 1, 2023.\nThere were two changes on the Supervisory Board in 2022. On the employees\u2019 side there was one change: Roberto Armellini was a member of the Supervisory Board until July 31, 2022; Daniele Frijia has been a member since August 17, 2022. The Supervisory Board thanks Roberto Armellini for his work. On the share- holders\u2019 side, as announced in 2020, Klaus Eberhardt stepped down from the Supervisory Board at the end of the company\u2019s Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2022. The Supervisory Board thanks Klaus Eberhardt for his many years of service and his enormous commitment. Gordon Riske, former CEO of KION GROUP AG is the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board of MTU Aero Engines AG. He was elected to the Supervisory Board at the company\u2019s Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2022 with 97.46% of the votes. The Supervisory Board then elected him as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank the Exec- utive Board for its close and constructive collabora- tion. It would also like to thank all employees and the Works Council for their successful work and enormous commitment in 2022. Moreover, the Supervisory Board is grateful to all MTU\u2019s shareholders for the trust they place in the company.\nMunich, March 21, 2023\nGordon Riske\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n / Report of the Supervisory Board\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG\nI FISCAL YEAR 2022 15\n  \nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS\nIT risks\nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nIn addition to the risk that the MTU might not be able to recruit enough skilled workers, there is a risk of losing staff to other companies. The company is of the opinion that some MTU employees have technological know- how that makes them attractive to competitors or other employers. MTU\u2019s success depends on its ability, not simply to employ technically skilled specialists, but also to retain them over the long term, motivate them and support their personal and professional development.\nFailure to recruit, retain and drive forward the develop- ment of qualified employees could impair MTU\u2019s ability to realize its planned business performance.\nAll in all, MTU considers the human resources risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to control them.\nRisks arising from general, customs and tax legislation\n(Compliance risks, governance risks, country risks, business environment risks)\nComplex and in some cases conflicting international foreign trade and tax regulations, especially with regard to cross-border trade in goods and services in the indus- trial and defense sectors, mean that MTU is particularly exposed to violation of legal provisions. To compensate for relevant legal risks, processes that reinforce control are monitored and driven forward by central functions with technical and managerial authority. Identifiable risks arising from pending tax audits, customs audits, export controls and legal proceedings are managed by the central departments with the support of indepen- dent external consultants. The focus lies in particular\non targeting process weaknesses and compensating for them. All in all, MTU considers the risks arising from general, customs, export control and tax legislation to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to control them.\nOverall assessment of MTU\u2019s risk exposure\nRisks in each of the key areas of exposure described above are monitored and continuously evaluated through a risk assessment for the coming fiscal year on the basis of their probability of occurrence and quantified as a deviation relative to the currently applicable operational planning figures. In MTU\u2019s risk management process, risks are assigned to one of four probability levels. Based on quantifiable risks (>\u20ac5 million) evaluated in the risk management process, for fiscal 2023, MTU derives risk- based earnings exposure based on experience of around \u20ac85 million. The OEM segment accounts for around \u20ac65\n(IT risks, communication risks)\nMTU constantly monitors its risk situation in the area\nof data processing. The two risks considered to be most critical in this field are system crashes due to technical faults and cyberattacks, resulting in the non-availability of systems, unauthorized disclosure of information, or permanent loss of data. In view of the advanced digita- lization of all material business processes at MTU, high availability and integrity of IT systems are crucial for smooth business operation. MTU generates, stores and processes extensive data with special confidentiality requirements \u2013 not only, but in particular, in the military business.\nMTU constantly invests considerable sums in technical and organizational measures to guarantee the availabil- ity, confidentiality and integrity of the IT systems used or operated by the company. Nevertheless, it cannot\nbe ruled out that MTU will be confronted with system failures, unauthorized access to confidential information or the loss of data. Every data theft, unauthorized data manipulation or data loss could negatively affect MTU\u2019s relationship to present or potential customers. Incidents like this could expose MTU to liability claims by third parties. All in all, MTU considers the IT risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to control them.\n\nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmillion of this and the MRO segment for the remainder. In addition to the earnings impact, the liquidity impact of the risks is identified, monitored and addressed through the risk management process. In 2023, the identified risk factors could reduce liquidity by approximately \u20ac180 million. However, this would be covered by available cash and cash equivalents and by credit lines that have not been drawn down. \u20ac131 million of this amount relates to the OEM segment.\nBoth segments\u2019 risk exposure principally comprises market and program risks. In the OEM segment, the mar- ket and program risks relate to risk-and-revenue-sharing contracts with OEM partners and include the risk of adverse effects from the development of the business if capacities and the supply of parts required to meet high- er maintenance requirements for the GTF fleet cannot be increased sufficiently fast. Similarly, there is uncertainty regarding the export of military equipment. In the MRO segment, further demand effects in connection with the forecast market recovery have to be taken into account as further risk drivers. The estimated impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic on business development in 2023 has been taken into consideration in the segment planning.\nApart from the risks quantified above, MTU monitors and manages further risks associated with development, production, maintenance and procurement that were not quantifiable as of the reporting date. At present,\nthe Executive Board does not see any risks that could jeopardize MTU\u2019s status as a going concern. All in all, the Executive Board considers the risk situation to be manageable, especially in light of the risk management system and the measures taken to control the risks.\nOpportunity report\nThe integrated opportunity and risk management system is embedded in the value-oriented management of the Group and its organizational structures and is based on the leading international standard, the COSO II Enter- prise Risk Management Framework.\nMarket and program opportunities\nBasic research and ongoing development of engine technologies, followed by their deployment in end products, have made MTU one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers of engine components. MTU\u2019s new prod- ucts lead the field in terms of efficiency because they save fuel and reduce emissions, noise and costs. MTU has achieved market success with the Pratt & Whitney GTFTM engine family, which it develops in partnership\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nwith Pratt & Whitney. The A320neo, Airbus A220 and Embraer E190-E2 with GTF engines are already being used successfully in scheduled service. Since 2018, the PW800 engine family, developed in cooperation with Pratt & Whitney Canada, which is based on the same core engine as the GTF, has powered premium manufac- turer Gulfstream\u2019s new generation of business jets. In order to balance out its engine portfolio in the long-haul segment, MTU has participated in the development of the GE9X, which will be the sole engine for the Boeing 777X. Thanks to this balanced portfolio, MTU expects to benefit in the decades ahead from the predicted growth in all present market segments: the regional jet, narrowbody and widebody segments. The expected growth relates to both commercial series and new components business and the spare parts and aftermarket business, which should benefit, in particular, from the business perfor- mance of the V2500 engine programs and successively from the GTF program family.\nAmong its customers in the military sector, MTU has established a reputation as a highly qualified partner with comprehensive system know-how in product devel- opment, manufacturing and maintenance. In particular by driving forward its military-engine maintenance services with the German air force, MTU sees chances to strengthen its ties with Germany\u2019s armed forces.\nIn addition, the official start of the FCAS program in the reporting period and additional new components and aftermarket business \u2013 especially for the EJ200 engine for the Eurofighter and the TP400-D6 for the A400M military transporter \u2013 open up further business opportu- nities with national and international customers. These will doubtless receive a further boost from the increase in international defense budgets resulting from the geo- political developments in the reporting period.\nDriven in particular by the T408 engine, the military-pro- gram partnership with GE Aerospace could generate further opportunities to participate in transatlantic programs in the future.\nThe development of the maintenance business in the aviation industry, in which MRO services are increas- ingly being offered together with engine sales contracts, gives MTU the opportunity, as a consortium partner, to develop customer loyalty in the commercial maintenance segment and soften the impact of risks associated with the spare parts market. This integrated approach to MRO enables program partners to become members of an MRO network, giving them access to the entire volume of\n/ Risk and opportunity report\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 88\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMRO work associated with an engine series, in accor- dance with their share in the program. There is a variety of models for participating. For instance, partners in the MRO network might only perform repairs on their own components, or be allocated a quota of complete shop visits corresponding to their program share. Membership in an MRO network offers more moderate margins than operating as an independent MRO provider.\nThe independent MRO market for engines such as the GE90 and V2500 continues to offer long-term prospects for MRO providers to participate in this steadily grow- ing market. In particular, the increase in the number of aircraft no longer tied to the OEMs offers independent MRO providers like MTU the opportunity to gain new customers and to assume responsibility for managing the maintenance of large fleets.\nContinued investment in automation and the focused in- crease in maintenance capacity, for instance through the establishment of MTU Maintenance Serbia d. o. o. and EME Aero Sp. z. o. o., will enable MTU to meet the high demand in both the OEM and MRO segments cost-effec- tively in the long term.\nThrough MTU Maintenance Lease Services B. V., Amster- dam, Netherlands, MS Engine Leasing LLC, Rocky Hill, CT, USA, and the partner companies in the PW1100G- JM MRO network, MTU aims to extend its activities in the lucrative leasing business and increase the scope of services provided in the aftermarket.\nResearch and development opportunities\nThe risk report describes the risks associated with re- search and development and manufacturing, but MTU\u2019s ongoing technology and development activities also open up new business opportunities. For example, ongoing development of products and the related manufacturing technologies and, in particular, intensive involvement in developing innovative propulsion concepts in collabora- tion with industrial, public-sector and scientific partners, pave the way for MTU to secure a position as a strategic partner in future engine programs. This could help en- sure a balanced portfolio of engines and new propulsion concepts at different life cycle phases both in the series and new components business and in the spare parts and aftermarket business. Attention should be drawn\nto MTU\u2019s participation in the FCAS program in the reporting period as this can be regarded as an important driver of the ongoing development MTU\u2019s technological expertise for the aviation sector.\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nThe risk report refers to the challenges involved in ramping up new or relatively new programs; here too, the challenges can be transformed into opportunities. Production processes and systems can be optimized,\nfor example through the use of digital twins, predictive simulation (ICM2E), process data management and the forecasts derived from this, and new, cutting-edge manu- facturing technologies and processes can be introduced. The risk analyses undertaken to secure the ramp-up of production, backed up by the MRL process and design or process FMEA, result in timely identification of potential problems and the related lasting process improvements. The effects of these improvements are not only felt in new programs; they can also be transposed to existing ones. That leads, for example, to further cost reductions and enhanced delivery reliability. The spread of additive manufacturing techniques (3D printing of components) opens up new possibilities for application-optimized com- ponent design and cost benefits in their production.\nThrough continuous improvements towards operational excellence, methods, processes and leadership behavior are constantly being developed as part of Lean Manage- ment@MTU. This results in increased transparency, a focus on value creation, support in achieving ambitious targets, and faster and more sustainable problem-solving and approaches to improvement. Improved preventive approaches, a faster response to deviations from plan and sustainable and structured solutions to problems enable the company to put in place stable processes and optimize resource deployment. For further information, please refer to the section headed \u201cResearch and develop- ment.\u201d\nOther opportunities\nAs a large part of the company\u2019s revenue comes from contracts invoiced in U.S. dollars, especially in the com- mercial new engines and series business (OEM) and the commercial spare parts and aftermarket business (OEM, MRO), a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would improve MTU\u2019s earnings. If there is a stabilization or short-term drop in inflation, especially in the areas\nof energy and raw material prices, this would have a positive effect on MTU\u2019s cost structure and hence on its business results.\nSee the Risk report for information on how the opportuni- ties identified can be exploited and the associated risks avoided.\n   / Risk and opportunity report\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 89\n \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMain features of the internal control and risk management system\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nInternal control and risk management system\nMTU understands an Internal Control System (ICS) to be the principles, procedures and measures introduced at the company by its management that are aimed at the organizational implementation of management decisions.\nThe risk management system (RMS) is a continuous\nand systematic process that has to be applied uniformly throughout the Group to ensure early identification, eva- luation, management, monitoring and reporting of risks. The overriding objective is to safeguard the existence of the company and its future success.\nThe ICS and RMS are based on the globally recognized and established framework of the Committee of Sponso- ring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO I) and the applicable requirements and basic elements of the audit standards issued by the German Institute of Public Auditors (IDW PS 981 and 982).\nThe Executive Board of MTU bears overall responsibility for establishing the ICS and RMS. They are aligned to the business model and specific requirements of the MTU Group and are an important element in its comprehen- sive approach to corporate governance. This comprises\na framework for creating sustainable value for sharehol- ders, customers, employees and society.\nAll MTU entities are included in the ICS and RMS. The local management of each entity is responsible for reali- zing an appropriate and effective ICS and RMS, based on the Group-wide requirements, and is supported in this by the central divisions.\nThe Risk Management Board, which is comprised of MTU\u2019s highest risk manager and selected heads of vari- ous functional areas, is an overarching decision-making body that examines aspects of risk management, discus- ses and takes decisions on reported risks or those that have to be reported to the Executive Board, and oversees the functioning of the risk management system.\nMTU\u2019s internal audit function, which is process-indepen- dent, plays an important role in checking the effective- ness of, and improving, the ICS and RMS. It regularly assesses, and helps to enhance, the controlling and moni- toring systems. It is also considered to have an advisory function, contributing to improving business processes and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the ICS. The rules\nof procedure of the internal audit function comply with national and international requirements as laid down\n/ Main features of the internal control and risk management system\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 91\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nby the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Interne Revision and the Institute of Internal Auditors. The internal audit function is also bound by the code of professional ethics. The ad- ministrative standards of the internal audit function are accessible to all employees on MTU\u2019s intranet.\nThe Executive Board regularly assess the ICS and RMS at the end of each fiscal year. In 2022, this assessment was based on the analyses and audits performed by the rele- vant units, Internal Audit and external consultants du- ring the reporting period. The findings were discussed in detail at meetings of the Executive Board and the Audit Committee and measures were introduced for continuous optimization, especially to harmonize the documentati- on. Based on this, the Executive Board did not identify any indication that the ICS or RMS was inappropriate or ineffective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board discus- ses risk management and the audits by the internal audit function. In accordance with Section 107 (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), as amended by the German Accounting Law Modernization Act (Bil- MoG), it is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the RMS, the ICS, the internal auditing systems, the financial reporting process and the audit of the financial statements.\nCompliance Management System\nThe ICS and RMS also include a compliance management system (CMS), which is aligned to the company\u2019s risk situation.\nMTU\u2019s compliance management system is based on the requirements of the IDW AsS 980 assurance standard published by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany and the Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics, and Compliance issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nAs the highest decision-making authority, the CEO bears the responsibility for the company\u2019s business ethics and anti-corruption policy. The central functions responsible for ensuring compliance are a Group-wide Compliance Officer and the Compliance Board.\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nMTU has implemented a number of measures with regard to its organizational structures and processes to minimize these risks and to safeguard compliance. In particular, central offices with managerial authority have been set up to monitor and enforce compliance with laws and regulations in the individual divisions (for instance, the Quality division is responsible for compliance with aviation authority regulations, while the Environmen-\ntal Protection/Occupational Health and Safety division ensures that environmental protection regulations are adhered to). Above and beyond that, measures have been put in place at the company level to minimize the risks associated with compliance issues:\nThe corporate culture at MTU is characterized by trust and mutual respect. The observance of legal and ethical rules and principles plays a central role in this respect. They are defined in a Code of Conduct, which embo- dies MTU\u2019s corporate culture and reflects its resolve\nto comply strictly with the relevant laws and internal regulations. It is a Group-wide guide to ethical business relations.\nThe Compliance Officer submits quarterly reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Com- mittee, which in turn reports to the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the Executive Board\u2019s compliance activities. The company has established a global whist- leblower system that allows employees and external stakeholders to report suspected cases of misconduct confidentially to the Compliance Officer.\nMTU strives to continuously develop its compliance system. That includes raising employees\u2019 awareness of compliance-related matters.\nDescription of the principal features of the accounting-related ICS and RMS\nThe current recommendations of German Accounting Standard (GAS) 20 have been applied in this section of the combined management report concerning the main features of the accounting-related internal control and risk management system.\n/ Main features of the internal control and risk management system\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 92\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT\nObjectives and components\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nMain features\nMTU\u2019s Executive Board, Supervisory Board and Audit \u2044 Committee attach the greatest importance to ensuring\nthe regularity, accuracy and reliability of MTU\u2019s financial reporting. The accounting-related internal control and\nrisk management system applicable for the MTU Group\u2019s financial statements helps ensure systematic compliance\nwith these internal and external accounting require- \u2044 ments.\nMTU has a clearly defined management and corpo- rate structure. Key cross-organizational functions\nare coordinated centrally by the Group accounting department. At the same time, the subsidiaries have sufficient independence and are responsible for finan- cial reporting.\nAppropriate guidelines (e.g., accounting principles / financial reporting guidelines) are in place and are updated as required. The Group accounting depart- ment is the central point of contact for questions on financial reporting at Group level or at individual sub- sidiaries and joint ventures and has the right to issue instructions within its area of responsibility.\n\u2044 The accounting-related risk management system (RMS) is an integral part of the Group\u2019s company- wide risk management system. It forms the basis for the uniform and appropriate handling of risks and\nfor communicating them within the Group. The risks inherent in the Group\u2019s financial reporting are among the corporate risks to be monitored as a whole.\n\u2044 The design of the accounting-related internal control system (ICS) at MTU meets the requirements of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act (BilMoG), the definition provided by the Institute of Public Au- ditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer e.V. \u2013 IDW), the internationally recognized and established framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza- tions of the Treadway Commission (COSO I), and the features specific to MTU. MTU understands an ICS to be the principles, procedures and measures introdu- ced at the company by its management that are aimed at the organizational implementation of management decisions:\n\u25a0 to safeguard the effectiveness and economic efficiency of business operations \u2013 which includes protecting the company\u2019s assets,\n\u25a0 to ensure the regularity and reliability of internal and external accounting, and\n\u25a0 to comply with statutory regulations relevant to the company.\n\u2044 Preparation and quality assurance for the financial data communicated by the Group companies for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements are undertaken on a decentralized basis by the respective finance departments on the basis of the Group-wide reporting guidelines.\n\u2044 As a supplementary control measure, (plausibility) and quality control checks on the reported data are carried out by the Group accounting department and during the consolidation process for the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2044 To safeguard and enhance the integrity and respon- sibility of all employees, including with respect to financial reporting, all employees are required to give an undertaking that they will observe the Group-wide Code of Conduct and the applicable internal regulati- ons (e.g., the financial reporting guidelines).\n\u2044 The (professional) qualifications of staff employed in the finance function are regarded as important for the quality of the Group\u2019s accounting process and are monitored and driven forward by the management team. The departments and other organizational units involved in the accounting process are suitably equip- ped and regularly trained both in quantitative and qualitative terms. In this context, the structure and workflows are regularly reviewed with the support\nof external consultants and by comparison with peer group companies.\n/ Main features of the internal control and risk management system\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 93\n  \n\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs a result of this process, for 2022, nine topics were defined as relevant for the non-financial statement in accordance with the German CSR Directive Implemen- tation Act (CSR-RUG). CSR-RUG requires the provision\nof relevant non-financial information on the business performance, operating results and position of the Group. Information is also required on the impact of its busi- ness activities on the following aspects: environmental matters, employee matters, social matters, human rights, combating corruption as well as possible additional aspects. As one such additional aspect, the non-financial statement contains information on product quality and flight safety. The non-financial statement contains one change in the key topics relating to the reporting period: Energy management has been given a higher weighting and merged into \u201cClimate protection at the production locations\u201d because CO2 emissions from the operation\nof MTU\u2019s sites (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) mainly result from the use of energy. The materiality evaluation of the topics was discussed and confirmed by the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\n[T38] Contents of the non-financial statement\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\ncompany. The Munich, Hanover and Ludwigsfelde sites provide information on their environmental impact and activities in annual environmental declarations.\nMTU is committed to the global sustainability initiative, UN Global Compact, and its ten principles including res- pect for human rights, fair working conditions, protecting the environment and fighting corruption. In addition, the company is represented on relevant initiatives such as the TRACE International anti-corruption initiative.\nRisk management for non-financial topics\nRisk identification and evaluation for the topics covered by the non-financial statement are based on MTU\u2019s established opportunity and risk management. The po- tential risks to the environment, society and employees resulting from MTU\u2019s business activities are compiled and evaluated quarterly by the responsible staff in the departments and the CR Board analogously to the estab- lished opportunity and risk process, taking into account, in each case, the probability of occurrence and impact of the risk. In this process, the risk inventory is reviewed for new material topics and aspects.\nTo supplement the risk management process, MTU\nhas established a compliance system with a separate reporting line. It is organized and managed by the Com- pliance Officer.\nThe risk analysis did not reveal any reportable risks with a high probability of having a severe negative impact on the identified non-financial topics.\nProduct quality and flight safety\nQuality and safety are of paramount importance in aviation and the corresponding framework conditions\nare strictly regulated. Legal requirements for the safe operation of flights are closely monitored by the aviation authorities. This is reflected in the high importance MTU places on product quality and flight safety. The company has to comply with the legal requirements imposed upon it as a development, manufacturing and maintenance organization in the aviation industry. MTU continuously evaluates the regulatory requirements for its business activities in order to obtain or keep the required licenses, approvals and certifications from the aviation authorities.\nA Group-wide integrated management system (IMS) ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and internal regulations as well as clear assignment of responsibilities within the company. One principle of the IMS policy is that \u201cSafety takes priority in what we do.\u201d The basic framework is enshrined in a management manual that is binding for all employees and managers across the Group. Corporate Quality is a separate orga-\n  Aspect in accordance with\nthe German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG)\nAdditional aspect Environmental matters\nCombating bribery and corruption Employee matters\nRespect for human rights\nKey topics for MTU\nProduct quality and flight safety\nClimate impact\nof aircraft engines\nClimate change mitigation at the production sites\nPrevention of bribery and corruption\nOccupational safety Employee development\nRespecting the human rights of employees\nRespect for human rights in the supply chain\nResponsible international trade\n                Under the CSR-RUG definition of materiality, no rele- vant topics have been identified for the aspect of social matters.\nInvolving stakeholders\nMTU is also engaged in dialogue with external stake- holders regarding environmental and social impacts. Stakeholders can give feedback on MTU\u2019s sustainability management via an online survey. There are also perso- nal and anonymous reporting channels that stakeholders can use to submit complaints and grievances to the\n/ Non-financial statement\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 101\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs the highest decision-making authority, the CEO bears the responsibility for the company\u2019s business ethics and anti-corruption policy. The central functions responsible for ensuring compliance are a Group-wide Compliance Officer and the Compliance Board. The Compliance Officer is responsible, in particular, for ongoing develop- ment of MTU\u2019s established compliance system to prevent corruption. He works in close consultation with the Com- pliance Board. The Compliance Board holds both regular and ad-hoc meetings at the invitation of the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer submits quarterly reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee, which in turn reports to the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the Executive Board\u2019s compliance activities. In addition, the Compliance Officer has a regular direct reporting line to the CEO.\nThe company has established a global whistleblower system that allows employees and external stakeholders to report suspected cases of misconduct confidentially to the Compliance Officer. As well as the scope to seek personal contact, the web-based iTrust system can be used to submit reports anonymously. The Compliance Officer examines all allegations received and manages the necessary measures if they prove founded.\nZero tolerance of bribery and corruption\nMTU\u2019s goal is to prevent bribery and corruption throug- hout the Group (principle of zero tolerance). To minimize corruption risks, all sales-related consultancy contracts are reviewed by the Compliance Officer, where relevant with the assistance of external service providers, before they are concluded or renewed. The Corporate Audit unit examines the legal conformity of business processes and compliance with internal guidelines through regular audits.\nThere were no confirmed cases of corruption in the reporting period.\nExternal standards and memberships\nMTU\u2019s compliance management system is based on\nthe requirements of assurance standard IDW AsS 980 published by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany and the Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics, and Compliance issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It has also signed the standards issued by the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), which aim to prevent bribery and corruption and encourage\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nfair and equal competition. In Germany, this initiative\nis led by the German Aerospace Industries Association (BDLI). Moreover, these standards are a binding element of contracts with sales consultants.\nContinuous development of the compliance system\nMTU strives to continuously develop its compliance system. That includes raising employees\u2019 awareness of compliance-related matters, for example, with the aid\nof training materials on the Code of Conduct. Training with these new training materials, which were introdu- ced in 2021, continued in the reporting period. 3,131 employees had taken part by year-end 2022. In addition, mandatory anti-corruption training is regularly held for managers and employees in specific functions such as sales. In the reporting period, routine corruption pre- vention training was organized for relevant employees in maintenance sales.\nOccupational safety\nMTU places a great deal of importance on the safety of its employees. Employee health and safety are included in the Group-wide Code of Conduct as key principles of corporate social responsibility. The Code of Conduct also specifies that workplaces must meet statutory and generally recog- nized industrial health and safety standards. In addition, MTU has an internal standard that contains generally valid parameters, rules and definitions of performance in- dicators. Quarterly Group-wide reporting to the Executive Board is established. Occupational safety is organized on\na decentralized basis at MTU and the sites are respon- sible for implementing the relevant requirements. At the company\u2019s production sites, occupational safety is the responsibility of the site management and occupational safety officers are appointed at management level. The responsible local departments implement site-specific occupational safety requirements and report regularly to the site management. The company\u2019s production sites in Germany, Poland and Canada have local occupational safety committees, which include representatives of the workforce.\nOccupational safety is part of MTU\u2019s integrated manage- ment system (IMS) and is regularly reviewed and driven forward. At the European production sites, workplace regulations that are mandatory for all employees contain important safety rules pertaining to accident prevention, fire protection and what to do in the event of workplace or commuting accidents.\n/ Non-financial statement\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 107\n  \nTO OUR COMBINED CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS MANAGEMENT REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA code of conduct for suppliers is in place to cover the upstream value chain. MTU\u2019s suppliers are required to give an undertaking that they will comply with this Code of Conduct for MTU Suppliers, which is based on the\nten principles of the UN Global Compact and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The Code of Conduct requires suppliers to respect and apply human rights, and to make sure that they are not complicit in human rights violations. In particular,\nit requires observance of labor standards relating to freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, the ban on forced and child labor, equal pay regardless\nof gender and the equal treatment of employees. MTU also expects its suppliers to obtain a corresponding undertaking from sub-suppliers and reserves the right\nto terminate any contract with a supplier without notice if the supplier uses child labor in the production process for its deliveries. In addition, these principles of behavior are contained in the general business conditions and the contractual documents for suppliers.\nSuppliers to the sites in Germany, Poland and Canada and the subsidiary MTU Aero Engines North America are subject to a regular risk analysis. This takes account of MTU-specific product groups and the countries where they are sourced, based on the evaluation in the Walk Free Foundation\u2019s Global Slavery Index. This risk ana- lysis is integrated into the established risk process for suppliers. As a further step, there are plans to monitor significant suppliers\u2019 compliance with sustainability cri- teria. For this purpose, MTU has established and started to roll out an ESG assessment tool (ESG = environmen- tal, social, governance). A pilot project to monitor the sustainability performance of OEM suppliers has started. In addition, at MTU Maintenance, a structured supplier evaluation is performed twice a year for suppliers to the German sites.\nVarious measures are used to achieve the goal of ensu- ring that human rights are respected in the supply chain. These apply, above all, to the procurement of tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, which are used in some MTU com- ponents. Procurement of these minerals can be proble- matic because some of them come from Central African mines where the profits may be used specifically to fund armed conflicts that violate human rights. MTU strives\nto ensure a sustainable and transparent value chain without these \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d The company does not procure minerals directly but they enter production and pre-production via the global, multi-step supply chain. The general conditions of business and the templates for contracts with MTU suppliers require information on the origin of minerals. This information is compiled using\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT INFORMATION\nthe EICC/GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template. MTU makes it compulsory for relevant suppliers of components containing minerals declared in the Dodd- Frank Act to provide information once a year on the origin of minerals and specifies that minerals may only be procured from certified mines and smelters (compli- ant smelter list) in order to ensure that the value chain does not contain conflict minerals. Based on its survey in 2022, MTU has no indication that components from its suppliers contain conflict minerals.\nMoreover, in the reporting period there were no reported indications that suppliers had violated the human rights provisions of the Code of Conduct for MTU Suppliers. Furthermore, MTU did not have to terminate its relation- ship with any suppliers as a result of breaches of human rights.\nThe German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obliga- tions in the Supply Chain (LkSG) will apply to MTU Aero Engines AG from 2023. In the reporting period, an interdisciplinary project team started to prepare for its implementation.\nResponsible international trade\nTrade compliance plays a vital role for MTU. One impor- tant goal here is to avoid violations of human rights. The provisions of international trade legislation apply to all business units and Group companies, including their em- ployees. Customs and export control laws govern which products, services and technical data MTU is permitted to sell or pass on to whom, for what purpose and where. Compliance with customs legislation and international trade regulations is explicitly stipulated in MTU\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nExport control law prohibits doing business with specific countries or individuals, and the supply of sensitive goods, transfer of advanced technologies, and provision of military services without explicit authorization by the respective official bodies. This is intended, in particular, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological and che- mical weapons, to prevent the supply of military goods or goods that can be used for military purposes to crisis regions, to prevent support for blacklisted individuals and activities that violate human rights, and to protect sovereign security interests. Under customs regulati- ons, MTU is required to provide a precise description, detailed itemization and accurate declaration of the value of all goods intended for import or export. What is more, anti-boycott laws may prohibit individuals and entities from participating in other countries\u2019 economic boycotts and restrict the dissemination of information relating to business activities or individuals.\n/ Non-financial statement\nANNUAL REPORT MTU AERO ENGINES AG I FISCAL YEAR 2022 112\n \n \n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

The Board of Management has accordingly issued a declaration to respect and protect human rights,\nwhich we have published on the Munich Re website (www.munichre.com/sustainability/download). This statement underscores Munich Re\u2019s commitment to human rights, as defined in the Declarations from the United Nations (UN) or the International Labour Organization (ILO).\nMunich Re has undertaken to apply its respective due diligence and to respect internationally recognised human rights. By signing the UN\u2019s Global Compact in 2007, we have committed ourselves to the following principles:\n/ Promoting and protecting internationally recognised human rights within our scope of activity\n/ Taking precautions designed to prevent Munich Re from contributing to human rights violations, for example human trafficking\n/ Upholding the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining\n/ Supporting the elimination of any kind of forced or child labour\n/ Helping to put an end to discrimination in hiring and employment\n\n Munich Re Group Annual Report 2022\nThese principles are also enshrined in our Code of Conduct, the compliance with which is mandatory for all Munich Re staff. We are thereby aiming to create a Group- wide understanding of the value of human rights.\nIn addition, we are also committed to safeguarding human rights as set out in the UN\u2019s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, international human rights treaties and the ILO\u2019s declaration on fundamental principles and rights.\nIn accordance with international rules, we have published a statement signed by the Board of Management on the UK Modern Slavery Act every year since 2017, and since 2021 we have issued a declaration under the Australian Modern Slavery Act as well.\nMunich Re\u2019s management is committed to preventing its business from potentially negatively affecting human rights. In order to systematically monitor any such effects, the following four aspects have been defined: staff, procurement, our core business of reinsurance and primary insurance, and investments. We have introduced instruments for each of these aspects, which allow us to manage our respective decision-making processes in terms of human rights. This enables us to eliminate any risk of human rights violations as far as possible.\nIn addition, Munich Re has developed a human-rights-based strategy for using artificial intelligence in compliance with European Commission guidelines, which covers data protection, monitoring, discrimination, bias, unintended consequences, and intentional abuse.\n\nCombined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nWe also strive to improve the guarantees of fundamental rights, which also include human rights. We do this, among other ways, by offering tailor-made insurance products. For example, we provide innovative risk solutions to ensure that underinsured people in Asia have the basics needed to live. Special financial solutions aim to close the coverage gap for populations and companies at risk, and to guarantee swift and targeted payments. Fundamental rights and guarantees are also the focus of many of our fundraising and sponsorship projects.\nFurther information can be found in our Sustainability Report, our annual Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact, and our annual reports on the PSI and the PRI.\nMeasures\nIn 2018, we developed the following processes to fulfil our human rights due diligence, which are reviewed annually:\n/ Undertaking by management to comply with human rights\n/ Identifying and assessing risks with regard to human rights violations\n/ Implementing and monitoring measures\n/ Reporting and communication\n/ Support and grievance mechanism\nStaff and external consultants can use Munich Re and ERGO\u2019s whistleblowing portals to report possible or\nactual human rights violations. If a human rights violation is reported, or we otherwise learn of one, Munich Re\u2019s dedicated Compliance units will investigate. Every potential case is investigated in accordance with a procedure set out in internal guidelines. Every potential case of misconduct will be investigated and resolved. If we learn of human rights violations in an existing contractual relationship, we decide on appropriate and effective remedial action in dialogue with the responsible parties.\nStaff\nAs employers, we undertake to comply with international standards of human rights and to provide adequate working conditions for our staff.\nOur Code of Conduct explicitly states that Munich Re does not tolerate any discrimination. In Germany, we have set up an official department for complaints as provided for in Section 13 of the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).\n42\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\nProcurement\nOur goal in procurement, when making decisions and taking action, is to comply with our principles and thus assume corporate responsibility along the entire supply chain. Avoiding ESG risks is pivotal in our procurement of goods and services. We had previously required our suppliers to accept the principles of the UN Global Compact. Now we have made our expectations in terms of respecting human rights even clearer, by adopting a Group-wide Code of Conduct for suppliers. The structured risk analysis process that we are currently introducing will allow us to even better identify potential human rights breaches in future, and to mitigate or avoid them accordingly.\nInsurance activities\nMunich Re has adopted underwriting guidelines to specify how underwriters and client managers are to handle ESG risks in insurance business. If any human-rights-related risks are identified during the underwriting risk-assessment process, our goal is to discuss and agree on mitigation measures in a dialogue with the corresponding contracting party.\nIn the insurance business, sensitive business issues or sectors have been identified in which social aspects, including human rights, are to be taken into account in the risk assessment. Mandatory guidelines and best practices relevant to human rights, among others, have been developed for these issues.\nIf the assessment of a potential transaction concludes that there is significant reputational risk, the issue is escalated to the respective reputational risk committee for a decision.\nInvestments\nFor the purposes of sustainable investment, government bonds and notes from quasi-governmental institutions rated CCC under the MSCI ESG system are excluded due to high risks related to socio-economic or political factors. These MSCI government ratings also take human rights into account. Moreover, in late 2022 the Responsible Investment Guideline was updated to include human rights standards, among other criteria.\nAs responsible investors, we also support the international conventions related to controversial weapons (anti-personnel mines and cluster munition), and exclude any direct investment in equities or bonds from companies active in those sectors.\n\nCombined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nMeasures\nMunich Re takes a clear stand against racism, inequality and discrimination of any kind. Our Group-wide Code of Conduct, which is binding on all employees, prohibits discrimination, social misconduct and harassment. In Germany, employees receive regular mandatory training on the German Equal Treatment Act (AGG) and the Code of Conduct to promote understanding and compliance. An escalation process for reporting incidents is clearly defined and complaints offices have been established in the event of discrimination.\nThere are different measures in place to increase the proportion of women in management positions: these include a requirement for diversity in candidate lists and selection committees Group-wide, strict oversight of senior appointments by the Board of Management, an even stronger focus on equality in talent development and Group-wide monitoring of progress in gender diversity. These key figures are integrated into the quarterly Group-wide reporting process of our business figures.\nTo achieve this goal, Munich Re has created a supportive environment and implemented numerous measures to promote the personal development of all employees. Established support measures were continued in 2022. These include mentoring programmes, coaching, networks for different employee groups, and individual part-time and parental-leave models. Several family support services in the areas of childcare, eldercare and career counselling complement these offerings. In addition, new and innovative programmes are regularly developed and introduced individually in the regions of the fields of business.\nFurther measures to support gender diversity include, for example: participating in the \u201cbreak the bias\u201d project on International Women\u2019s Day, various women\u2019s networks, (for example \u201cEFEU\u201d and the Women\u2019s Inclusion Network (WIN) in reinsurance, or win@m at MEAG), or the mentoring programme for ambitious women and the \u201cFrauen im Vertrieb\u201d project at ERGO.\nThe 10 (12) women\u2019s networks had 2,073 (2,217) members in 2022. A total of 2,567 (2,814) participants attended events during the business year.\nBeyond the gender initiatives, many other measures took place. The following activities reflect the strong commitment of Munich Re employees to DEI topics in 2022:\nA total of 16 (20) events were held worldwide in the 4 (4) networks of the LGBTIQ+ community.\nReinsurance continued its collaboration with Prout at Work. In addition, a range of learning programmes are provided through LinkedIn Learning and the Catalyst learning resource and are open to all employees globally. These\n47\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\nofferings were promoted on World Cultural Diversity Day and during Pride Month \u2013 the awareness month for the LGBTIQ+ community \u2013 in June. A specific goal set by the reinsurance units in the US was to reach 55% diverse employees by 2023 \u2013 diverse referring to employees with underrepresented identities. This goal was already reached in 2022.\nTo address the issue of unconscious bias, ERGO conducted a \u201cDiversity Day\u201d in Germany in 2022. Two e-learning formats were launched to coincide with the event. They show how unconscious bias occurs and provide numerous examples and strategies on how to avoid such patterns of thinking. In addition, the \u201cDigital Diversity Map\u201d introduced in 2019 has been expanded in collaboration with the international organisation. The \u201cDigital Diversity Map\u201d provides transparency on the most crucial diversity metrics and offers insights into the activities of the foreign subsidiaries. Since its launch, ERGO\u2019s \u201cDigital Diversity Map\u201d has been expanded every year with new statements and updated figures. It currently contains 90 videos from\n20 companies in 16 different countries with statements and messages around DEI.\nIn our various talent programmes, we continue to particularly emphasise balanced diversity.\nMetrics\nAt the end of 2022, the proportion of women in management positions worldwide was 38.5%, a further increase compared to 2021, but still 1.5 percentage points short of our target. Progress was also made in the two management levels below the Board of Management and in the quotas for women at Munich Reinsurance Company.\nThe following proportions of women were achieved in the talent programmes: Group Management Platform/ Group 41% (38%), Hydrogen/reinsurance 42% (38%), Oxygen/reinsurance 49 (47%), ERGO Grow 50% (38%). The proportion of women in the trainee programmes was as follows: EXPLORE/Group 60 (60)%, International Graduate Trainee Programme/reinsurance 54% (51%), RISE/ERGO 60% and Futures/MEAG 33% (56%).\nFurther information on women in management positions (targets and status) is provided in the Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code, in the section \u201cEqual participation of women and men in management positions\u201d.\nAn increase in the internationality of the talent programmes was also achieved, as measured by the distribution of participants between Germany and abroad. The following results were attained: Group Management Platform/Group 58% (45%), Hydrogen/reinsurance 76% (73%), Oxygen/ reinsurance 78% (83%).\n\nin our Code of Conduct, and we strive to maintain our stakeholders\u2019 trust and protect Munich Re\u2019s reputation. Appropriate conduct plays an important role in this regard. This means that Munich Re aims to comply with all applicable statutory, supervisory and other external rules and standards, particularly those related to the insurance and investment business, and with all internal regulations on avoiding material compliance risks in all of our business activities.\nCompliance is the responsibility of every employee.\nBased on the Code of Conduct and other commitments to responsible conduct (e.g. the UN Global Compact), all staff have undertaken to act honestly and dependably. They are to make business decisions in accordance with the law, statutes and internal regulations, and avoid any conduct that could be harmful to Munich Re. Our Board of Management and managers are particularly responsible for implementing compliance as an integral part of our business processes. Our managers are role models for our staff and have a duty to ensure that business within their sphere of responsibility is conducted in accordance with the law, statutes and internal regulations.\nUnderstood correctly, for us compliance means acting in accordance with the law, statutes and internal regulations, such as the Code of Conduct, which apply to operating an insurance and investment business. Compliance is thus\na key element of our business processes and allows us to fulfil our responsibilities and to embody integrity.\nProviding quality advice to customers is a top priority at Munich Re. At ERGO this can be seen, for example, in its having signed in 2012 the Code of Conduct issued by the German Insurance Association (GDV) for the sale of insurance products. This Code obliges the signatory insurers and their brokers to not only comply with high standards of advice and brokerage, but to also have this compliance regularly checked by independent auditors. In 2020, for the third time, KPMG confirmed that ERGO was effectively implementing the contents of the Code. The next audit is scheduled for 2023.\nWe have set ourselves the goal of enabling our staff to conduct themselves ethically and legally through a defined reference framework, including a Group-wide Code\nof Conduct, guidelines and standards. Training, advice from managers and staff, and proper communication of corresponding content also play important roles in this regard.\nMoreover, we aim to identify, monitor and investigate key compliance risks using Group-wide methodology, which also uses a set framework concept to evaluate the controls, and also to investigate potential violations that may occur despite these appropriate measures.\nA further goal is to continually improve the Compliance Management System, eliminate and resolve violations, and regularly report to the appropriate parties.\n   In summary, progress was again realised on the 2022 reporting topics, and strategic decisions were made that set the direction and ambition for the coming years. In doing so, we will continue to foster Group-wide approaches to specific topics and establish different operational implementations within the organisation that can optimally support the respective business model and the respective employee structure.\nGovernance\nIn this section, we report on the topics of compliance as well as responsible digital transformation, data protection and cyber security.\nCompliance\nStrategy and objectives\nHow Munich Re is perceived by the public and our business partners depends on each and every member of our staff. Our actions are guided by the principles and values detailed\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCombined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nIn order to meet these goals, we define, among other things, Group-wide standards and monitor compliance risks. These particularly include corruption and bribery, which are not tolerated (zero-tolerance policy) at\nMunich Re; money-laundering provisions and antitrust law; product sales and design (sales compliance) that allow a relationship of trust and fairness with our clients; and data protection, to ensure that data entrusted to us is handled securely. Complying with financial sanctions and constantly keeping up with the most recent geopolitical developments was particularly important in 2022. The latest regulatory standards are constantly monitored and integrated into the Company, for example in ESG.\nMeasures\nCompliance Management System (CMS)\nThe compliance function is responsible, among other things, for establishing and monitoring the necessary organisational measures to ensure compliance on the\npart of Munich Re, its management and its staff. We have developed a CMS for this purpose that meets external compliance standards \u2013 such as ISO 19600 and IDW PS 980 from the German Institute of Certified Accountants (IDW) \u2013 and was carefully tailored to meet Munich Re\u2019s needs. The CMS constitutes the methodological framework for the structured implementation of the early-warning, risk-control, advising and monitoring functions.\nMunich Re\u2019s CMS is geared to the aforementioned goals and is designed as follows:\n49\nThe scope and means of implementing compliance activities with regard to the above-mentioned CMS elements are guided by the risk profile of the respective Group company, though the implementation of minimum standards is mandatory for all entities.\nBasis\nOur business activities are embedded in a compliance culture based on our core values, which are particularly reflected in the Munich Re Code of Conduct, our main standard for staff behaviour.\nCompliance organisation involves designing the structure of the compliance function, which includes determining the tasks, responsibilities and processes with regard to compliance measures and interfaces. Our compliance unit manages compliance activities through Group-wide standards and a network of regional and local compliance officers.\nPrevention\nThe compliance norms specify principles and minimum standards for preventing and avoiding material compliance risks.\nThe advisory function responds to compliance-related questions from staff, provides advice on specific cases, issues general recommendations, and shows senior management, managers and staff how to assess and avoid compliance risks, but also how to avoid potential external and internal breaches and react accordingly.\nOur Group-wide communication and training are aimed at increasing awareness of compliance risks and dealing with them effectively. Both are aimed at and tailored to the needs of the various German and international Group companies and their respective business models. Staff and management are obligated to regularly attend training \u2013 either in the classroom or via IT-supported programs \u2013 on the Code of Conduct and selected compliance topics, such as preventing corruption, ensuring compliance with antitrust law, and data protection. Mandatory tests help participants grasp and internalise the content long-term, especially in the case of online material.\nDetection\nThe assessment of compliance risks includes the systematic identification, analysis and mitigation of such risks. The process is based on a Group-wide methodology used to identify, assess and document risks. Munich Re\u2019s main compliance risks and the corresponding mitigation measures are analysed and reported to management at least once a year. The main risk areas include data protection, financial sanctions, antitrust law, money laundering, sales compliance, corruption, and ESG. The management of changes to the law is part of our risk assessment, in order to evaluate in good time any possible effects of changes in the legal environment.\n Munich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCombined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nMonitoring consists of evaluating whether the implemented measures for mitigating material compliance risks are appropriate and effective. Monitoring includes, among other aspects, reviewing the defined frameworks and assessing the design and effectiveness of the controls implemented.\nInternal investigations are conducted by the compliance function if there are allegations or suspicions of illegal activity and/or misconduct within the company. We have set up a comprehensive whistleblower system for reporting suspicious activity.\nResponse\nContinuous improvement means regularly reviewing\nour CMS and compliance measures on the basis of risk assessments, monitoring and other relevant information from the various departments (audit reports, legal changes, organisational changes, etc.), and making adjustments\nif necessary. In this regard, the maturity of the CMS is assessed on an annual basis using quantitative and qualitative checks and metrics. These include completion of mandatory online training sessions, for example on anti-corruption, antitrust law, data protection and the\nCode of Conduct. The same applies to the number of whistleblowing complaints and other allegations received, as well as to the number, type and severity of compliance violations identified.\nCompliance reports are submitted to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee every six months, and ad hoc when required. Reporting includes, but is not limited to, information on significant compliance risks and mitigating measures, compliance-related violations and statements regarding the maturity of the CMS, as well as an overview of the adequacy and effectiveness\nof the procedures implemented to comply with external requirements. Reporting also includes regularly communicating with supervisory authorities such as the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\nSelected compliance programmes\nWe have set up dedicated compliance programmes as minimum standards for compliance risks of Group-wide relevance, for example corruption and bribery, compliance with financial sanctions, money laundering rules and antitrust law, sales compliance and data protection. Monitoring the implementation of these programmes is the responsibility of the respective local compliance organisation.\nDue to its international activities, Munich Re is also subject to foreign corruption-prevention laws such as the UK Bribery Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States. Accordingly, we have adopted Group-wide minimum standards on appropriate conduct regarding invitations, gifts, donations and sponsorships, as well as on interacting with public officials. Fighting corruption is a compliance programme that is subject to a zero-tolerance policy at Munich Re.\n50\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\nMunich Re is also committed to fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The companies that are subject to the German Money Laundering Act (GWG) have been set up accordingly; officers responsible for money laundering issues, and their deputies, have been appointed where mandated by the GWG. ERGO and MEAG have, through in-house anti-money-laundering policies, set up fundamental standards for their staff in the relevant companies to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Identification of customers, service providers and suppliers is done in accordance with the know-your-customer principle and the process is integrated into corresponding due-diligence reviews.\nWhistleblowing portal\nWe maintain a Group-wide reporting system for violations of the law and other regulations. Staff can report potential violations to Group Compliance & Legal or their line manager. In addition, they can contact an external, independent ombudsman. The compliance whistleblowing portal is available to all staff and external parties for reporting violations. This allows allegations to be reported securely, anonymously and confidentially. Any reports received are forwarded to Group Compliance & Legal or the responsible local compliance organisation. The platform can be used to report potential violations relating to financial crime (corruption, financial sanctions, fraud), regulatory requirements, money laundering, tax law, antitrust law, insider trading, sales compliance, data protection, human rights (and other ESG matters), gender discrimination, sexual harassment, diversity and violations of equal-treatment provisions. The anonymity protection function of Munich Re\u2019s compliance whistleblowing portal has been externally certified under ISO 27001.\nMunich Re\u2019s whistleblowing portal complies with the new standards of the EU Whistleblowing Directive 2019/1937 and is complemented by local whistleblowing systems.\nMetrics\nMunich Re records any violation of purely internal policies, statutory or regulatory rules, supervisory requirements, or other external rules or standards (hereinafter: \u201cexternal requirements\u201d), as a compliance incident. Such incidents constitute an essential component of our reporting to the Boards of Management and Supervisory Board Audit Committees of Munich Re companies.\nIn 2022, 443 (652) allegations of potential misconduct were received through the various reporting channels at Munich Re. All allegations were carefully and impartially investigated, while maintaining the anonymity and protection of the whistleblower, upon request. No violations with a material financial impact or systematic vulnerabilities were identified.\n\n                                                                       Combined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nDetails about the allegations and violations appear in the following tables. Information about allegations and violations concerning data protection can be found in the\nAllegations of possible misconduct and violations\nTotal\nNon-confirmed violations Ongoing investigations Confirmed violations\nThereof violations of purely internal requirements\u000e\nThereof violations of external requirements\u000e\n\nTax law\nOffences to the detriment of third parties or the Company\nSales- or product-related requirements\nHuman resources \" Unfair competition and antitrust law , Money laundering \u00e0 \u00e0 Financial sanctions \u00e0 \u00e0 Human rights or other ESG aspects \u00e0 \u00e0 Insider trading and market manipulation \u00e0 \u00e0 Corruption \u00e0 \u00e0\n\n\nOf the total of 93 (78) confirmed violations of external requirements, a total of 19 (13) were sanctioned with disciplinary action.\nThe findings from our investigations of suspected and actual compliance violations are used to continually improve the CMS.\nResponsible digital transformation, data protection and information security\nStrategy and objectives\nDigitalisation and the challenges it entails for staff with regard to data protection, information security and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) continue to gain in importance. Their importance has particularly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transformation efforts towards digital and data-driven processes have significantly accelerated in many insurance companies as well. It is important for Munich Re to ensure that digital data and technologies are used responsibly, and to remain\na trusted partner on the market by offering innovative solutions for our clients. Against this backdrop, we have made responsible and ethical digitalisation an essential component of our business strategy, and are making targeted investments in technology and staff.\nDue to the nature of its business, Munich Re comes into contact with a large amount of data. Protecting this data is important to us, especially given the fact that increasing digitalisation means that many business processes handle personally identifiable information. Compliance with data protection regulations is also a significant element of maintaining Munich Re\u2019s reputation and the trust of our business partners. In the area of data protection, compliance with national and international regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the main drivers for the development of our management approach. Moreover, in the various fields of business, data-protection management systems have been implemented to systematically monitor and control how we handle personally identifiable information.\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCombined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nAt the same time, we consistently apply the three pillars of protection in the information security field: confidentiality, availability and integrity of our information. The requirements in this regard are driven by statutory and supervisory regulations, and are an integral component of Munich Re\u2019s corporate strategy. Accomplishing these objectives constitutes a key factor to our business success. Our goal in this regard is to tailor the levels of protection of our data and information to the respective risk, in the context of the increasing digitalisation of our business processes. When defining our level of ambition, we took both the findings from our review of supervisory requirements (for example, the \u201cSupervisory Requirements for IT in Insurance Undertakings\u201d \u2013 VAIT) as well as benchmark comparisons into account.\nMunich Re\u2019s Code of Conduct and various business-field- specific standards include mandatory rules for all staff and are intended to ensure that data protection and information security are dealt with consistently.\nFor Group companies situated within the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) the rules regarding data protection refer primarily to the GDPR. Based on the GDPR, Munich Reinsurance Company, ERGO and MEAG have each adopted a data protection policy covering their activities in the EU/EEA in order to ensure\na consistent, mandatory level of protection across these fields of business. For our intra-Group data sharing with reinsurance companies situated outside the EU/EEA, binding corporate rules on data protection aim to ensure an appropriate level of data protection at our locations worldwide.\nWhere necessary, data protection officers have been appointed to handle data protection in reinsurance, ERGO and MEAG. The Group\u2019s data protection organisation is centrally coordinated by the Group Compliance & Legal division. Among other tasks, the data protection officers and experts work in their respective areas of responsibility to ensure compliance with the data protection regulations, monitor the lawfulness of IT-supported data processing, advise the respective companies on their duties under the applicable data protection regulations, answer staff questions on data protection, and serve as a first point of contact in communications with the supervisory authorities. Reports are made at least once a year to Munich Reinsurance Company\u2019s Board of Management concerning significant data protection issues and improvements to Munich Re\u2019s data protection management systems.\n52\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\nParticularly complex and risky data protection concerns at Munich Re are handled by the Data Strategy and Governance department, which is overseen by the Compliance and Legal division and serves as a centre of excellence. All Munich Re staff can benefit from the department\u2019s data protection expertise.\nManagement of information security risks is the responsibility of the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO). This involves defining, updating and implementing the information security strategy, which includes numerous measures and projects executed by the Group CISO.\nTo support this, within the Group we have also implemented guidelines on information security and business continuity management for relevant companies; these guidelines set binding targets, minimum requirements, responsibilities, processes and reporting procedures as to information security and business continuity.\nThe idea of \u201cresponsible artificial intelligence\u201d is the foundation of our work in the field of artificial intelligence. It is based on the seven Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence elaborated by an expert group at the European Commission.\nMunich Re\u2019s main goal when using AI in reinsurance is to offer solutions that are tailored to our clients\u2019 needs, for example by making it easier and quicker for them to assess risks, settle claims, or insure new types of risk. Moreover, Munich assumes the performance risk associated with AI- based models through innovative insurance products such as aiSureTM.\nIn primary insurance, data and artificial intelligence are also key factors driving digital transformation, particularly though intelligent process automation and strong, individualised client service.\nMeasures\nTo continuously improve our digitalisation processes, we implemented numerous measures in the reporting year.\nMunich Re staff receive regular training on the GDPR, mandatory internal data protection regulations and information security with the aid of e-learning programs. All new staff are also required to complete the e-learning programs during their onboarding period. Moreover, division- specific online courses were added in the reporting year.\n\nCombined management report\nCombined non-financial statement\nWe continue to offer training courses, for example our data analytics curriculum, that are targeted to specific groups of staff, such as developers, users and managers. We have also expanded our training programme with regard to trustworthy artificial intelligence.\nIn order to provide transparency about data protection risks and information security risks, and to fulfil its own data protection accountability in this regard, every instance of IT-supported processing of personally identifiable information at Munich Reinsurance Company is reviewed using a defined process. Any data processing that entails\na high risk of violating an individual\u2019s rights or restricting their freedoms is identified and monitored through a privacy impact assessment. ERGO and MEAG comply with their accountability obligations under data protection law with the help of corresponding processes. In addition to the aforementioned data-protection risk reviews, every new instance of IT-supported data processing is reviewed \u2013 depending on the protection needs of the processed data \u2013 for compliance with information security requirements.\nThe data-protection and information security processes are continually refined so as to integrate them in future into an overarching governance, risk and compliance platform and into a third-party risk management system.\nIt is our declared goal to avoid any type of discrimination through AI, which could for example arise through the use of historical data. In addition, we check that our data resources cover all relevant demographic groups where possible, for example as to age, sex, nationality or ethnic background. At the same time, we bear in mind the legal, social and cultural standards of every country in which\nwe do business. Moreover, making our algorithms as transparent as possible is a matter we take seriously. Through partnerships with the scientific community and academic institutions, we have access to the latest techniques for illustrating the behaviour of AI systems.\nAppraisal\nIn 2022, as in the previous year, no material data protection events as defined in the Solvency II Group Compliance Policy were identified anywhere in our Group worldwide, nor were any material proceedings for breach of data protection regulations initiated. Nevertheless, Munich Re is increasingly the target of cyber attacks, which threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information and business processes. As a result, measures that both prevent such attacks and facilitate their identification are being continually improved, particularly in this area. We are also optimising the systematic management of any such incidents.\n53\nFurther details\nIn the following section, we provide further information under the German Commercial Code (HGB) about our business model, our management\u2019s involvement, and about non-financial risks and how we deal with them, for a fuller understanding of the sustainability of our actions.\nDetails on the business model\nMunich Re is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of reinsurance, primary insurance and insurance-related risk solutions. The information about Munich Re\u2019s business model, required under Sections 289c(1) and 315c(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), is published in the Group section.\nSustainability governance structure\nWe have clearly defined organisational responsibilities for sustainability throughout the Group. Fundamental strategic decisions are taken by the Board of Management, or, more specifically, by the ESG Committee, a subcommittee of the Strategy Committee. The ESG Committee is supported by the ESG Management Team, which is composed of the heads of the central divisions and departments responsible for important ESG topics, as well as the chief underwriting officers from reinsurance and ERGO, and which is responsible for implementing and monitoring the Group- wide ESG strategy. The ESG Committee\u2019s objective is to strengthen the Group\u2019s ESG management and accentuate the strategic importance of ESG topics for the Group. The Group\u2019s Sustainability department supports the ESG Committee and the ESG Management Team; it also coordinates sustainability initiatives within the Group. This department is part of the Economics, Sustainability & Public Affairs (ESP) central division, which reports directly to the CEO. In addition, we have been integrating ESG criteria into the Board of Management\u2019s remuneration system since 2012. This grants the Supervisory Board latitude to factor in aspects of sustainability when it considers remuneration. And from the 2022 financial year, at least one concrete ESG target is to be agreed for the multi-year bonus. Further information is available online at www.munichre.com/board-of-management.\nThe Supervisory Board addresses significant sustainability issues at least three times a year: based on the combined non-financial statement, through regular updates on\nESG strategy and implementation measures, and upon presentation of the annual personnel report. Several members of the Supervisory Board possess significant ESG expertise and are thus qualified to assess the information. Moreover, the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee regularly scrutinises ESG issues as part of its fundamental responsibility. Further information on the Supervisory Board\u2019s responsibilities and those of its committees can be found in the Supervisory Board Report.\n Munich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCombined management report 54 Combined non-financial statement\nRisk analysis\nFor us as risk carriers, risk management constitutes a key element of responsible and sustainable corporate governance. In the context of sustainability risks, we differentiate between \u201coutside-in\u201d and \u201cinside-out\u201d perspectives. Outside-in risks refer to ESG events or conditions that could have real or potential negative consequences on investments or liabilities. We address the management of outside-in risks in the risk report.\nBy contrast, inside-out risks are potential consequences that our business could have on ESG aspects, and thus correspond to the risks mentioned in Sections 289c(3) and 315c of the German Commercial Code (HGB) \u2013 risks to society and the environment, for example. Munich Re\u2019s business operations, unlike those of other sectors, normally do not result in any material risks that could very likely have grave consequences on the aspects named in\nSection 289c(2) of the HGB. Nevertheless, risks that can be categorised as sustainability risks may indirectly arise from investments or our insurance business, e.g. through covering major infrastructure projects.\nWe are aware of our corporate responsibility for these risks, and manage them accordingly. We describe our strategic approach to sustainability, and how we handle specific ESG aspects such as climate change, in various sections of the non-financial statement.\nNon-compliance with ESG criteria could also damage Munich Re\u2019s reputation. As a result, where societal and environmental risks are not already subject to specific operational standards, they are assessed by our reputational risk management and rejected if necessary. We identify, analyse, assess and monitor reputational risks with the aid of qualitative methods. Specific guidelines and process descriptions define how we deal with reputational and sustainability risks. Various measures raise our staff\u2019s awareness of reputational and ESG considerations, which in turn helps to mitigate risks. Reputational risk committees (RRCs) in the fields of investment, reinsurance and primary insurance (in the latter called the Reputation and Integrity Committee) assess concrete reputational concerns and any potential reputational or sustainability risks of individual transactions. The reviewed incidents are documented. We established uniform, Group-wide processes for handling reputational risks in the RRCs of the individual fields of business in late 2021. Moreover, we created an RRC in the Group Investment Management divisional unit in early 2022. As a result, the 2022 table does not provide any case numbers from the previous year for comparison.\nOutcome of assessment by RRC of transactions submitted for review of critical reputational risks\nDenied due to critical reputational risk Accepted& no critical\nreputational risk identified\nAccepted under specified terms\nNo reportable sustainability risks were identified in the 2022 reporting year.\nAbout this statement\nStatutory requirements\nIn the combined non-financial statement, we report in accordance with the requirements of the European Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the corresponding commercial law provisions of Sections 289b and 315b of the German Commercial Code. This statement combines the consolidated non-financial statement of the Munich Re Group and the non-financial statement of Munich Reinsurance Company. All content contained in the statement applies both to the Group and to Munich Reinsurance Company, unless otherwise noted.\nIn preparing the non-financial statement, we bore in\nmind the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, particularly when analysing the material issues and describing the concepts. An exhaustive report is published separately in the Sustainability Report, which is available at www.munichre.com/s-report.\nMoreover, our sustainability reports have followed the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2020. In the risk report, which includes a more detailed description of non-financial risks, our reporting on risks for insurance and investments resulting from climate change is also based on the TCFD recommendations.\nMoreover, the standards issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) have provided guidance since 2021 in compiling the non-financial statement \u2013 as acknowledgement of the increasing significance of SASB standards to investors.\n\n      The Board of Management is responsible for managing the Company, in particular for setting the Company\u2019s objectives and determining strategy. It is bound to act\nin the Company\u2019s best interests. It should take account\nof the interests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders of Munich Reinsurance Company, with the objective of sustainable value creation. The Board of Management is responsible for effecting adequate risk management and risk control. It must ensure that statutory requirements and internal Company rules are observed, and works to ensure compliance by Group companies and their staff members.\nCompliance\nThe Group Compliance and Legal division of Munich Reinsurance Company reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Management. Group Compliance and Legal manages the compliance activities and monitors their implementation by means of the Compliance Management System (CMS). The CMS is the methodical framework for the structured implementation of early warning, risk control, consulting and monitoring functions. More information on the CMS can be found in the combined non-financial statement and in the risk report.\nIn order to further strengthen compliance within the Group, the compliance whistleblowing portal serves as another channel of communication to complement the independent external ombudsperson. Staff members and third parties can use the portal to anonymously report any activity that may cause reputational damage, suspected contraventions of the law, especially financial crime (such as corruption offences, and money laundering), contraventions of antitrust law, insurance supervisory law, market abuse law, data protection law, and any serious breach of internal rules and regulations.\nThe Group has a comprehensive reporting system for issues relevant to compliance. This allows for regular and ad-hoc reporting to the Board of Management, the Audit Committee or equivalent and ensures ongoing documentation. The reporting includes, but is not limited to, legal changes and their implications, significant compliance risks and measures to mitigate these risks, material compliance violations, statements regarding the maturity of the CMS as well as an overview of the adequacy and effectiveness of the procedures implemented to comply with the external requirements. It also comprises the regular exchanges with the supervisory authorities concerned.\nFurther information about compliance and the key features of the CMS can be found at www.munichre.com/en/compliance.\nWorking procedures of the Board of Management\nThe work of the Board of Management, in particular\nthe allocation of responsibilities among the individual Board members, matters reserved for the full Board\nof Management, and the majority required to pass resolutions, is regulated by rules of procedure issued by the Supervisory Board. The full Board of Management decides on all matters that, either by law, or according to the Articles of Association or rules of procedure, require a resolution of the Board of Management. In particular, it is responsible for matters requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board, for items which have to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting, for tasks which constitute management functions or are of exceptional importance, and for significant personnel measures.\n Munich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCorporate governance 114 Statement on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d of the German Commercial\nCode (HGB)\nMeetings of the Board of Management take place as required, but generally at least once a month, and are presided over by the Chair of the Board of Management. The adoption of a resolution requires the majority of votes cast; in the event of a tie, the Chair has the casting vote.\nThe members of the Board of Management cooperate closely for the benefit of the Company. On an ongoing basis, they inform each other about all important business transactions.\nComposition and working procedures of the Board of Management committees\nThree Board of Management committees ensure efficient work by the Board of Management: the Group Committee, the Reinsurance Committee, and the Strategy Committee.\nComposition of the Board of Management committees1\n\nThe following applies to all Board of Management committees: Where decisions within the sphere of responsibility of a committee relate to issues reserved for the full Board of Management, the respective committee will prepare these matters for decision. Committee meetings are held regularly, and as required. Only members of the Board of Management have voting rights on the committees. The committees are further governed by their respective rules of procedure, as adopted by the full Board of Management.\nSubcommittees of the Board of Management Committees\nAll three Board committees have set up subcommittees: specifically, the Group Committee has established the Group Risk Committee; the Reinsurance Committee has set up the Global Underwriting and Risk Committee as well as the Board Committee IT Investments; and the Strategy Committee has established the ESG Committee. These subcommittees also include senior executives from Munich Reinsurance Company and the Group who do not have voting rights.\n      Munich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCorporate governance 115 Statement on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d of the German Commercial\nCode (HGB)\nSubcommittees of the Board of Management committees1\n  Group Risk Committee\nGlobal Underwriting and Risk Committee\nESG Committee\nBoard Committee IT Investments\n\nThe work of these subcommittees is governed by their own written rules of procedure. Both the Group Risk Committee and the Global Underwriting and Risk Committee deal with risk management issues, albeit with different emphases. The Board Committee IT Investments is responsible for\nIT investments. The ESG Committee is the central management committee for fundamental, ESG-related strategic matters in the Group.\nRemuneration of the members of the Board of Management\nThe remuneration system for members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting is asked to endorse the system upon any material change and at least every four years. This was most recently the case on 28 April 2021. The remuneration report contains detailed information on the remuneration paid to the members of the Board of Management.\nThe remuneration system for members of the Board of Management and the remuneration report (which must be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval once a year) along with the Auditor\u2019s opinion are available at www.munichre.com/board-of-management.\nCollaboration between Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n\n\nCorporate governance 118 Statement on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d of the German Commercial\nCode (HGB)\nThe Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Board of Management.\nThe Supervisory Board is quorate if all its members have been invited to the meeting or called upon to vote, and if fifteen members \u2013 or ten members including the Chair \u2013 participate in the vote. Supervisory Board resolutions are adopted by a majority of votes cast, unless the law or the Articles of Association require otherwise. In the event of\na Supervisory Board vote being tied, should a second vote on the same motion also result in a tie, the Chair of the Supervisory Board has a casting vote. The Chair is authorised to make declarations for the Supervisory Board based on resolutions.\nSelf-assessment\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees regularly assess how effectively the Supervisory Board as a\nwhole and also its individual committees perform their duties. Following preparations by the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee in 2022, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-assessment based on a wide- ranging questionnaire. The Supervisory Board thoroughly discussed the findings of the self-assessment at its meeting on 13 October 2022. The self-assessment confirms that\nthe working relationships within the Supervisory Board and with the Board of Management are professional and constructive, and characterised by a high degree of trust and candour. In addition, the findings document the efficient organisation and execution of meetings, as well as appropriate reporting by the Board of Management. There was no indication of any fundamental need for change. A few optimisation measures were identified and are being put into practice.\nComposition and working procedures of the Supervisory Board committees\nThe Supervisory Board has set up six committees from among its members \u2013 the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee (until 7 June 2022: Standing Committee), the Personnel Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Conference Committee.\nThe committees adopt decisions by the majority of votes cast. With the exception of the Conference Committee, the chair of the committee has a casting vote in case of a tie. The full Supervisory Board is regularly informed about the work of the committees by their respective chairs.\nComposition of the Supervisory Board committees1\n  Praesidium and Sustainability Committee\nPersonnel Committee Remuneration Committee Audit Committee\nNomination Committee Conference Committee\n\nCorporate governance 119 Statement on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d of the German Commercial\nCode (HGB)\nand Sustainability Committee is responsible for an internal procedure \u2013 as per Section 111a(2) of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) \u2013 that assesses related-party transactions. The Committee regularly deals with sustainability issues (ESG), except in cases where other committees are responsible. The Praesidium and Sustainability Committee also prepares the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting, the Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 of\nthe Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and the Statement on Corporate Governance for the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee prepares\nthe annual self-assessment of the effectiveness of the Supervisory Board as a whole and its individual committees with regard to the performance of their duties. Further details about the self-assessment in the past financial year are provided in the section \u201cSelf-assessment\u201d and in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\nPersonnel Committee\nThe Personnel Committee prepares the appointment of members to the Board of Management. It also prepares the long-term succession planning together with the Board of Management, including setting targets for the number of women on the Board of Management. In addition, the Personnel Committee represents the Company in matters concerning the members of the Board of Management, and is responsible for personnel matters involving members of the Board of Management, unless these are issues that are the responsibility of the full Supervisory Board or the Remuneration Committee. This Committee approves loan transactions between the Company and members of the Board of Management and their related parties. The Personnel Committee also decides whether to approve sideline activities of members of the Board of Management, particularly mandates in supervisory boards or similar committees.\nRemuneration Committee\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the Supervisory Board\u2019s resolutions on determining, amending, and regularly reviewing the remuneration system for the Board of Management; this Committee also determines and reviews the total remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management. In addition, the Remuneration Committee prepares the Supervisory Board\u2019s resolutions regarding determination of the level of variable remuneration components, determination of the performance criteria and objectives for variable remuneration, the assessment of objectives, and the determination of the variable remuneration to be granted to the individual Board of Management members. The Personnel Committee may be involved in this assessment. Where sustainability (ESG) issues are concerned, the Praesidium and Sustainability Committee may be involved in determining and assessing the performance criteria and objectives for variable remuneration. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for preparing the remuneration components of the employment contracts of members of the Board of Management, and for remuneration reporting with regard to\nthe remuneration of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee prepares Supervisory Board resolutions on the adoption of the Company\u2019s annual financial statements and approval of the consolidated financial statements. It discusses the Half-Year Financial Report and the material information underlying the quarterly statements, and receives the audit reports, other reports and statements by the external auditor. The Audit Committee also discusses the essential components of the Solvency II reporting with the Board of Management.\nThis Committee monitors accounting and the financial reporting process. It also monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management system, the internal control system, the CMS (including whistleblowing)\nand handling of material compliance cases, the actuarial function system and the internal audit system. Furthermore, the Audit Committee is responsible for examining potential claims for breach of duty against members of the Board of Management.\nThe Audit Committee prepares the procedure for selecting the external auditor, in particular the Supervisory Board\u2019s proposal to the Annual General Meeting. The Audit Committee is responsible for assessing performance and monitoring the independence of the external auditor; it also monitors and assesses the quality of the audit and any additional services provided by the external auditor. In particular, it hires the external auditor for the Company and Group financial statements as well as for any voluntary external audit of the combined non-financial statement. The Audit Committee also defines focal points of the audits and agrees the auditor\u2019s fee for the annual audits; the same applies to the review of the Half-Year Financial Report and the review of the solvency balance sheets. Beyond this, the Committee handles the approval and monitoring of non-audit services.\nAfter in-depth deliberations by the Board of Management, the Audit Committee \u2013 together with the Board of Management \u2013 prepares the annual discussion of the risk strategy by the Supervisory Board, and discusses any changes to or deviations from the risk strategy with the Board of Management during the year.\nIn this connection, the Audit Committee hears reports not only from the Board of Management but also directly from the General Counsel & Group Chief Compliance Officer, the Group Chief Auditor, the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Head of the Actuarial Function. Through the Chair of the Audit Committee, every member of the Audit Committee may obtain information from the heads of the central divisions responsible for the accounting process, the internal control system, the risk management system, the internal audit system and the audit of financial statements. Through its Chair, the Audit Committee maintains\na regular dialogue with the auditor also in between meetings. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly\nMunich Re Group Annual Report 2022\n\nCorporate governance 120 Statement on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d of the German Commercial\nCode (HGB)\ndiscusses the progress of the audit with the auditor and reports thereon to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee consults with the auditor on a regular basis without the Board of Management.\nNomination Committee\nThe Nomination Committee is made up exclusively of shareholder representatives.\nThis Committee provides the Supervisory Board with names of suitable candidates that the latter can nominate for election at the Annual General Meeting. As a basis for this, the shareholder representatives have developed and adopted a list of criteria for the selection of suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board. The Nomination Committee also proposes suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for the election of shareholder representatives to Supervisory Board committees and as chairs of the respective committees.\nConference Committee\nIf the first round of voting concerning the appointment or dismissal of members of the Board of Management does not result in the required two-thirds majority, the matter will be addressed by the Conference Committee before a second vote is held on the Supervisory Board.\nRemuneration of Supervisory Board members\nThe remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is laid down in the Articles of Association. The remuneration report contains detailed information on the remuneration paid to the members of the Supervisory Board. The resolution of the Annual General Meeting on the system of remuneration for members of the Supervisory Board dated 28 April 2021 and the remuneration report (including the Auditor\u2019s opinion)\nare available at www.munichre.com/supervisory-board.\nOther corporate governance practices\nMunich Re Code of Conduct\nOur business actions are geared to our Group-wide guidelines and standards that go beyond legal and German Corporate Governance Code requirements. For us, \u201ccompliance\u201d is not simply adhering to legal provisions, statutes and internal rules, but also extends to the fact that the decisions we take and activities we engage in are guided by our principles and values.\nThe main principles for compliant conduct and integrity are laid down in our Code of Conduct, which provides orientation to all employees and responsible management bodies in their daily work. The main principles include not only adherence to legal provisions and statutes but also a quest for sustainable value creation.\nFurther information can be found on our website under www.munichre.com/code-of-conduct.\nUN Global Compact\nTo make clear our understanding of important values inside and outside our Group, Munich Re joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2007. The ten principles of this declaration (covering human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and combating corruption) form the benchmark for our actions within the Group, and thus provide the fundamental framework for our corporate responsibility. Our Code of Conduct takes full account of these principles.\nWe report annually on the implementation of these principles in our Communication on Progress.\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI)\nMunich Re was one of the founding members of PRI in 2006. We implement the principles for sustainable investment through our Group investment function GIM and our asset manager MEAG, for example, and we report regularly on adherence to these principles.\nNet-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA)\nBeyond the PRI, we joined the NZAOA in 2020. We thus undertake to decarbonise our investments to net zero in order to reach the Paris climate targets.\nPrinciples for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA)\nThe PSI \u2013 which Munich Re played an active role in formulating and which we signed in 2012 as one of the first signatories \u2013 serve as a guide for anchoring environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects along the value chain in our core business. Moreover, we were one of the founding members of the NZIA in 2021.\nFurther information on these voluntary\ncommitments is available on our Sustainability Portal at www.munichre.com/sustainability.\nEqual participation of men and women in management positions\nAs at 31 December 2022, the percentage of women on the Board of Management was 11.1%; with 16.7% at the first management level and 26.5% at the second management level. The targets set as part of implementing the German Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Private- Sector and Public-Sector Management Positions (F\u00fcPoG) \u2013 25% at Board of Management level, 15% at the first and 35% at the second management level, all to be achieved by 31 December 2025 \u2013 have thus already been met as far as the first management level is concerned. At the second management level, the percentage has also continued to increase. Since 1 January 2023, the percentage of women on the Board of Management has been 20%.\nThe management levels are defined as follows: A manager at the first management level reports to a member of\nthe Board of Management. A manager at the second management level reports to a manager at the first\n   Munich Re Group Annual Report 2022\nThe image features a table summarizing the confirmed violations of external requirements for a company, categorized by different types of compliance areas, comparing the number and proportion of incidents in 2022 to the previous year. Here\u2019s a detailed description of the content:\n\n### Table Headers\n- **Confirmed Violations of External Requirements**: Title indicates that these are instances where the company failed to meet external legal or regulatory standards.\n- **Columns**: The table is divided into columns showing the type of violation, the number of incidents in 2022 and the previous year, the share of each type of violation in those years, and the percentage change year-over-year.\n\n### Categories of Violations\n- **Regulatory Requirements**: Decreased significantly from 44 incidents in the previous year to 15 in 2022.\n- **Tax Law**: Decreased from 13 to 6 incidents.\n- **Offences to the Detriment of Third Parties or the Company**: Increased substantially from 9 to 29 incidents.\n- **Sales- or Product-Related Requirements**: More than quadrupled from 7 to 36 incidents.\n- **Human Resources**: Doubled from 3 to 6 incidents.\n- **Unfair Competition and Antitrust Law**: Halved from 2 to 1 incident.\n- **Money Laundering**: No incidents were reported in either year.\n- **Financial Sanctions**: No incidents were reported in either year.\n- **Human Rights or Other ESG Aspects**: No incidents were reported in either year.\n- **Insider Trading and Market Manipulation**: No incidents were reported in either year.\n- **Corruption**: No incidents were reported in either year.\n\n### Summary Statistics\n- **Total Incidents**: Increased from 78 in the previous year to 93 in 2022.\n- **Total Share**: Stays constant at 100% as it represents the total of reported cases each year.\n- **Change**: There is an overall increase of 19.2% in the total number of reported incidents year-over-year.\n\n### Analysis\nThis table provides a clear quantitative measure of the company's compliance performance, highlighting areas of improvement and concern. For example, significant increases in offences related to third parties or the company, and sales or product-related requirements suggest areas that may need more focused compliance efforts. Meanwhile, substantial reductions in regulatory and tax law violations indicate possible areas of improvement or successful implementation of corrective measures. This data is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the company\u2019s compliance program and for planning future compliance strategies.\nThe image provides a schematic overview of a compliance management framework within an organization, structured around three primary processes: Prevent, Discover, and Respond. This model integrates various elements to ensure effective compliance and cultural adherence. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Top-Level: Culture\n- The overarching element is \"Culture,\" which underscores that the entire compliance program is influenced by the organization's culture. It emphasizes the importance of norms, risk assessment, and continuous improvement as foundational aspects that drive the compliance culture.\n\n### Primary Compliance Processes\n- **Prevent**: This stage focuses on proactive measures to prevent compliance issues. It includes:\n  - **Communication Training**: Essential tools to educate and inform employees about compliance standards and expectations.\n  \n- **Discover**: This process involves mechanisms to detect or uncover compliance issues or irregularities.\n  - **Investigation**: Once potential compliance issues are identified, investigations are conducted to ascertain facts and understand the extent of the issue.\n\n- **Respond**: The final step involves acting upon the discoveries made in the previous stage.\n  - **Reporting**: It entails documenting the findings and taking necessary actions, which could include disciplinary measures, adjustments to policies, or other corrective actions.\n\n### Supporting Elements\n- Alongside the primary processes, the diagram includes boxes that detail supporting elements crucial for the compliance operations:\n  - **Norms Advisory**: Provides guidance and advice on regulatory norms and internal policies.\n  - **Risk Assessment and Monitoring**: Continuously evaluates potential risks and monitors existing controls to ensure they are effective.\n  - **Continuous Improvement of Measures and Controls**: Focuses on the ongoing enhancement of compliance practices to adapt to changing laws and operational needs.\n\n### Foundation: Compliance Organization\n- At the bottom of the diagram, \"Compliance organization\" is noted as the foundation that supports all activities. It is responsible for:\n  - **Implementation of 1st- and 2nd-line compliance responsibilities**: This refers to the roles within the organization that directly handle compliance tasks (1st line) and oversee these functions (2nd line) to ensure robust compliance management across the organization.\n\nThis structured approach helps to ensure that compliance is embedded in all aspects of the organization's operations, from guiding principles and proactive prevention to responsive actions based on investigative outcomes. The framework highlights a systematic, integrated approach to managing compliance, aiming to embed ethical conduct and regulatory adherence into the corporate culture.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

As a result, the document is accessible in English, German, French, and Spanish, Munich Re's primary working languages.\u00a0\n- This procedure is predicated on a coordinated methodology for risk identification, assessment, and documentation used across the Group. At least once a year, the Group's material compliance risks and the associated risk-reduction strategies are examined and reported to the Board of Management. Internal and external whistleblowers can use the internet portal through the intranet (available exclusively to internal whistleblowers) and the Munich Re website. With an alias or username and password of their own choosing, individuals can set up a secure mailbox via the web portal. The whistleblower can communicate with Group Compliance and Legal or the relevant local compliance bodies in this way, exchanging files and messages in a secure and private manner.\u00a0\n\u00a0- Therefore,\u00a0 a separate investigation from the management chain is secured.\u00a0\n- The data and mailbox are only kept on the whistleblower system, and individual encryption keeps them safe from access by outside parties.\u00a0 This means that the CMS is evaluated on a regular basis and modified as needed depending on the outcomes of risk assessments, monitoring, and other pertinent data from the different departments. All new hires receive immediate notification of the Code of Conduct and must complete mandatory online training or pass an exam to prove they understand it. Workers often rectify their understanding of the Code of Conduct every two to three years.

Compulsory assessments, especially those conducted online, contribute to the long-term retention of the material. The coverage rate, as well as the scope and frequency of the training, are not mentioned. In conclusion, M\u00fcnchner R\u00fcck partly complies with G1-3 regulations."}]}

Trusting exchange with our stakeholders must be geared towards the long term and be nurtured on an ongoing basis. The Porsche AG Group believes it is important for people to talk to one another, not about one another. The company aims to understand different positions by adopting different perspectives, jointly overcome challenges, and foster long-term partnerships. The Porsche AG Group does this by using different media and dialogue formats, as well as various internal and external communication channels.\nThe Porsche AG Group establishes and maintains personal contact in order to maintain a continuous dialogue with its stakeholders. For instance, this entails events like the Neigh- borhood Dialogues at the company\u2019s sites. Since 2016, these have given, among others, local residents the opportunity to regularly engage with experts from the Porsche AG Group and raise specific issues.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the legal requirements meant that the dialogue formats planned for the reporting year could not take place as normal. Instead, the Porsche AG Group increas- ingly drew on virtual exchange with the key figures and groups in order to obtain direct feedback and input. If necessary, stake- holders can contact the department responsible for sustainabil- ity directly using the email address \u2197 sustainability@porsche.com.\nMemberships and networks \nThe Porsche AG Group promotes economic, environmental, and social topics through its involvement in networks, sustain- ability initiatives, and working groups. This too is part of the Porsche AG Group\u2019s stakeholder dialogue.\nUN Global Compact\nPorsche AG has been a member of the UN Global Compact, the world\u2019s largest and most important sustainable and responsible corporate governance initiative, since 2022. The platform for developing, implementing, and disclosing responsible business practices calls on companies to align their activities and strategies with the ten generally recog- nized principles in the fields of human rights, labor, environ- ment, and corruption prevention. They are also called on to take action to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Porsche AG will report to the UN Global Compact on its activities in these fields on a regular basis.\nThe UN Global Compact was founded in 2000. It is one of the largest sustainability initiatives in the world, with more than 19,000 companies and organizations in more than 160 countries.\nIn the year under review, Porsche AG joined the UN Global Com- pact, the world\u2019s largest and most important sustainable and responsible corporate governance initiative.\nDialogue with politics\nWhen the Porsche AG Group makes business decisions, the consequences of its actions for society and the environment have to be assessed and incorporated into the internal pro- cesses. The Porsche AG Group operates in a complex and heavily regulated field. It is important to engage in transparent and proactive dialogue with representatives from governments, par- liaments, authorities, associations, institutions, and representa- tives of civil society through political lobbying.\nThe employees of the Politics and Society department who are responsible for political lobbying work in and with associations at times. They are in regular contact with numerous nongovern- mental organizations (NGO) as well as civil society, political, and business representatives. In doing so, they set out the positions of the Porsche AG Group in social and political discourse, as well as decision-making processes. This takes place in compliance with binding Group-wide guidelines, as well as in coordination with the Volkswagen Group. Its policy is based on the principles of integrity, compliance, transparency, and traceability. Competition and antitrust legislation, as well as other legal provisions, are always taken into account too. Porsche AG\nis registered in the Lobby Register (\u2197 https://www.lobbyregister. bundestag.de) for the purposes of lobbying the German Bundestag and the German government.\nIn the coming financial year, the Porsche AG Group will continue to contribute to the working groups in the existing networks. Likewise, the Porsche AG Group is striving to join other sustainability networks and engage with them.\n\n\nTRANSPARENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Porsche AG Group is aware of the importance of its rep- utation to the success of its business. The Porsche AG Group regularly takes its stakeholders\u2019 interests into account when it makes relevant decisions. In particular, its stakeholders include customers, employees, investors, business partners, and non-governmental organizations. The Porsche AG Group sets great store by living up to the expectations of these stakehold- ers and society as a whole.\nAs the general public demands greater transparency, credible communication on ethical and responsible behavior is increas- ingly important. The significance of intensive communication with stakeholders is also rising: in a dynamic and increasingly complex environment, interactions between the Porsche AG Group and its stakeholders must be open and constructive. The Porsche AG Group wants to critically analyze social and ecological challenges, take the diversity of different viewpoints into account strategically, and discuss perspectives and prior- ities with stakeholders. A Group-wide policy has to ensure that internal and external communications are active, professional, transparent, consistent, and credible. Its purpose is to make sure that the Porsche AG Group represents its positions with one voice and consistent arguments.\nTransparency and communication\nA company cannot be credible or enjoy robust relationships with its stakeholders without clear communication and transparency. Substantial communication content is also crucial to success. Therefore, the Porsche AG Group prioritizes informing the general public and selected target groups about certain issues in an open, specific manner, such as: why is sustainability crucial to the Porsche AG Group? What ambitious targets have been agreed? Have these targets been achieved using the reported methods? Transparency and dialogue about these topics are integral aspects at the Porsche AG Group.\nESG management at the Porsche AG Group\nThe Porsche AG Group completed its IPO in the reporting year, which means that the expectations of the capital market have become more relevant. It is important to the Porsche AG Group to be seen as sustainable and valuable by analysts and other professional stakeholders. In particular, it aims to meet the sustainability expectations of investors and other market players who focus on environmental, social, and governance\n(ESG) aspects. ESG describes a series of sustainability-related requirements that the Porsche AG Group has to meet, and helps it categorize and evaluate its sustainability efforts more effec- tively. The Porsche AG Group wants to accomplish outstanding results here to impress its stakeholders.\nTo this end, it initiated a project to launch a software-based ESG management system in 2021, which continued in the reporting year. Adopting an integrated approach, it complements the strategy with additional key topics.\nThe ESG management system should make it easier for the Executive Board and the relevant departments to monitor and manage their ESG contributions, interpret results, and produce regular reports. In the year under review, work started on the construction of a centralized IT system for this purpose. The outcome of this system is pooled centrally within the Sustain- ability department.\nFurthermore, the Porsche AG Group has determined perfor- mance indicators, which illustrate material non-financial ESG contributions and transparently demonstrate the Porsche business model\u2019s contribution to sustainable development. The Porsche AG Group aims to control and measure its ESG contri- butions strategically on the basis of these key indicators.\nESG ratings\nThe Porsche AG Group has itself rated by external organizations to this end and bases its improvement measures on the results of these ratings. Selected independent rating agencies analyze the sustainability efforts of the Porsche AG Group.\nIn its sustainability strategy, the Porsche AG Group aims to\nbe rated \u201cin best class\u201d in independent sustainability ratings, which would make it one of the leading companies in the automotive industry. The Porsche AG Group considers this independent, external assessment to be an important tool and source of impetus: building on this, it can continuously improve its sustainability management. The Porsche AG Group has already received ESG ratings from third parties in the past: the Porsche AG Group considers the ESG rating of B- it received from ISS in October 2021 to be one of its most important achievements. The Porsche AG Group received one of the high- est scores in the automotive industry. \u2197 https://www.issgovernance. com/esg/ratings\nCOMPLIANCE AND INTEGRITY\nCompliance at Porsche\nThe following disclosures about compliance at Porsche AG complement the disclosures in the non-financial statement. Compliance and integrity are addressed in the \u2192 section entitled  \u201cResponsible corporate governance, compliance, and integrity\u201d.\nAt Porsche AG, the Code of Conduct sets out the most impor- tant principles and expectations of compliance in three different aspects: as a member of society, as a business partner, and in the workplace. Another code, the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, states that Porsche AG expects its business partners to adhere to the relevant laws, recognize basic ethical values, and act in a sustainable manner. Both of these codes explicitly bring the whistleblower system at Porsche AG to people\u2019s atten- tion. Furthermore, the Executive Board has adopted the Compli- ance Management guidelines: these represent an undertaking by Porsche AG to ensure compliance with laws and guidelines.\nCompliance organization and\ncompliance measures\nThe compliance management system (CMS) at Porsche AG\nis a preventative framework for the totality of all principles, measures, and objective processes that serve to safeguard and implement compliance in six areas of compliance. It is intended to ensure that violations of the law and/or directives in these areas of compliance are prevented, or at least rendered signifi- cantly more difficult.\nEmployees can report potential breaches of the rules using an internal whistleblowing mechanism that has been set up and communicated. Outside the company, employees and external individuals can report breaches to two ombudsmen who are subject to professional duties of secrecy under German law. These internal and external points of contact for the whis- tleblower system can be contacted in a variety of ways at any time, even anonymously, free of charge. Porsche AG acts on incoming reports, taking into account data protection, labor law, and co-determination regulations. Whistleblowers need\nnot fear any disciplinary measures or other repercussions from Porsche AG. Porsche AG reacts to identified violations in compli- ance with the data protection, labor law, and co-determination regulations. Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, suitable countermeasures are introduced on a case-by-case basis, and individual misconduct is punished on a case-by-case basis depending on the outcome of the investigation.\nOverall, Porsche\u2019s whistleblower system was responsible\nfor following up on 63 of 168 submitted reports. The plausi- bility check rated 34 of these 63 reports as plausible. Of the 34 plausible reports, 13 were categorized as potentially severe breaches of the rules, and investigated through Porsche\u2019s\nwhistleblower system. The focal points of the potential misconduct were violations of the German Trade Secrets Act (GeschGehG) and offenses against property (such as fraud and embezzlement).\nEight cases concluded in the identification of a serious breach of the rules and resulted in sanctions. Four investigations ended without identifying a breach of the rules. One case was still open at the end of the reporting year.\nThe central Compliance department has been conducting compliance monitoring since 2021. Besides interviews with managers, it involves risk-oriented activities such as random inspections of transactions that are of relevance in terms\nof compliance. The results are compiled in a report that also describes appropriate action if there is an evident need for improvement.\nCompliance communication at Porsche AG focused on intranet posts in the reporting year, addressing topics such as the updated Code of Conduct leaflet and International Anti- Corruption Day. The compliance officers also released various internal communications in the form of info sessions, posts\nin departmental groups, and messages to managers.\nCompliance training\nIn cooperation with the HR department, the compliance offi- cers provide compliance training at Porsche AG and selected subsidiaries. The basis is a subject-specific plan which uses risk analyses to identify the relevant target groups and key areas of content. There are mandatory training formats for managers, junior managers, and new employees. The compliance officers also provide organized training for specific departments and target groups, such as on legally mandatory or current topics, or on request.\nIn the reporting year, 5,817 employees at Porsche AG and its relevant German subsidiaries received compliance training at in-person and virtual events, and 57,337 participants received compliance training through digital training modules. The digital Code of Conduct training module was completed by 17,296 employees from Porsche AG and 7,458 employees from its relevant German subsidiaries. This training module covers the directive of the same name and provides information about the whistleblower system and the contact details of the com- pliance help desk. The training also covers the content of the \u201cAvoidance of conflicts of interest and corruption\u201d and \u201cHuman rights\u201d guidelines. By the end of the reporting year, the rate of training in face-to-face and virtual events within the target group at Porsche AG and its relevant German subsidiaries was 93% on average for the defined areas of compliance. In 2022, Porsche AG piloted a digital training module on fraud prevention within Procurement.\n    114\nSustainability Governance 115\n\nPorsche Mentoring is a format for a comprehensive exchange of experiences and changing views on both sides. In this program, managers support the professional and personal development of young talent.\nThe diversity networks and the mentoring program are open to all employees of Porsche AG and selected subsidiaries around the world.\nPorsche AG also campaigns for a diverse and inclusive togeth- erness outside of its work sites. The \u201cPorsche helps\u201d platform facilitates employees who want to get involved in voluntary activities, for example, one-off engagements, team events or major events at social organizations. The aim is to do good together and to gain new perspectives, experiences and skills. In the reporting year, team events were introduced, and some major events were expanded.\nRESULTS\nPorsche AG came sixth in the Women Career Index in 2022.\nThe Porsche women\u2019s network recorded significant growth numbers in the reporting year. The Proud@Porsche com- munity also became an official employee network in the reporting period.\nMore than 240 mentor tandems were actively involved in the mentoring format in the reporting year.\nThe Trendence Institute presented \u201cPorsche helps\u201d with the Trendence Award in the category \u201cCompanies helping people\u201d.\nDespite a slight decrease in the gender quota at the first man- agement level in the reporting year, Porsche AG still considers itself on track to meet the target by 2025.\nWomen in management positions \u2014 actual values for statutory  gender quota1\nStakeholder dialogue\nTARGETS\nThe aim of the Porsche AG Group\u2019s overarching stakeholder management system is to systematically capture the interests of various stakeholders as well as to derive key social trends and key topics from their interests and points of view. A major aspect is the active contribution to sustainability networks. The Porsche AG Group intends to join additional alliances to those it already has in order to get into contact with groups of stake- holders there. In the Porsche AG Group, the Politics and Society department coordinates the stakeholder management.\nStakeholder management at the Porsche AG Group includes continuously identifying relevant groups of stakeholders, ana- lyzing their interests and opinions and enabling direct dialogue. As a result of this, the Porsche AG Group is expanding its views and recognizing trends. It also receives impetus for improve- ments and innovations, exchanges expertise and finds coop- eration partners. In these dialogues, however, the Porsche AG Group also identifies potential problems, resistance and conflicts of interest at an early stage, creates a level of under- standing and takes countermeasures. The Porsche Sustainabil- ity Council plays a key role here. More information can be found in the \u2192 \u201cSustainability management\u201d section.\nDUE DILIGENCE PROCESS\nThe complaint management system is the central port of call for suggestions for improvement and complaints from internal and external groups of stakeholders at the Stuttgart-Zuffen- hausen site. It is centralized in Politics and Society as well as Environment and Construction Management. The Politics and Society department also provides the markets with international consulting services on the systematic recording of complaints relating to social or political matters. This also applies to the identification of measures.\nThe Porsche AG Group uses extensive surveys to learn about its stakeholders\u2019 opinions on sustainability and to include them in its strategy as part of the materiality assessment. To date, the Porsche AG Group has performed these stakeholder surveys every two years, most recently in 2021. More detailed conver- sations with selected stakeholders take place as needed.\nMEASURES\nThe Porsche AG Group was also engaged in proactive dialogue with its stakeholders and continuously expanded this dialogue in 2022.\nThe most important sources of information about the\nPorsche AG Group for thought leaders, decision makers and cus- tomers include the Porsche magazine Christophorus, the online Newsroom with its Twitter and Instagram channels, the web- based TV channel 9:11 Magazine, the 9:11 Porsche podcasts and the Porsche website.\nAll internal communications at Porsche AG are published in dig- ital and printed formats through the Carrera media. The Carrera Online web pages and the Carrera Magazine provide employees with information on the latest developments in the area of sus- tainability. Regular works and departmental meetings, employee information events, themed weeks and digital events also form part of the extensive array of internal communications. This is one way for employees to contribute their own thoughts and ideas and interact directly with their line managers.\nEvents such as the neighborhood dialogues held at various pro- duction and development sites enable Porsche AG to establish personal contact with local stakeholders. Since 2016, these have given local residents the opportunity to regularly engage with Porsche AG experts and raise specific issues and questions. The pandemic meant that no events with residents could take place on site in the reporting year. However, the email address \u2197 nachgefragt@porsche.de can be used for active dialogue with\nthe neighborhood. If necessary, stakeholders can contact the departments responsible for sustainability directly using the email address \u2197 sustainability@porsche.com.\nThe Porsche AG Group is an active participant in the industry dialogue on the German National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights (NAP). Porsche AG has also been a member of the German Environmental Management Association (B.A.U.M.) since 2016. In 2017, Porsche AG also joined the European Business Ethics Network Deutschland (DNWE) and became a signatory to the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s WIN Charter for sustainable business, marking its commitment to entrepre- neurial responsibility. In 2019, Porsche AG and the Volkswagen Group were the first automobile manufacturers to become a core component of the Value Balancing Alliance.\nIn the reporting year, Porsche AG joined the world\u2019s largest and most important initiative for sustainable and responsible corpo- rate governance, the UN Global Compact.\nThe Politics and Society department coordinates all the political topics that are relevant to the Porsche AG Group. It is also responsible for the Porsche AG Group\u2019s political lobbying and holds a transparent and proactive sociopolitical dialogue with representatives from governments, parliaments, authorities, associations, institutions and civil society. The Politics and Soci- ety department organizes and also supports visits by politicians and political events as well as providing regular updates on political topics and developments to the Executive Board.\nAll of the Porsche AG Group\u2019s political activities are coordinated via the Governmental Affairs Steering Committee to ensure a joined-up approach and consistent communications in dialogue with stakeholders.\nGroup-wide guidelines stipulate the principles of integrity, transparency and traceability for every political activity. It also contains guidelines for contact with political stakeholders and regulates the political lobbying process. All the people respon- sible for politics at the Porsche AG Group regularly notify the Volkswagen Group\u2019s Public Affairs department of their activities.\nRESULTS\nThe dialogue formats planned for the reporting year could not take place as normal because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the Porsche AG Group increasingly drew on virtual exchange with the key stakeholders in order to obtain direct feedback and input.\nIn 2022, there was no expenditure related to supporting political party events, advertising in publications affiliated with parties, or external lobbying agencies or services.\nGOVERNANCE\nThe Porsche AG Group\u2019s business practices are based on integrity, transparency and responsibility. Innovations cre-\nate new customer experiences, optimize added value and\nhelp reach sustainability targets. The Porsche AG Group sees digitalization as an opportunity for further development and\nis taking on responsibility as a partner in society with the Corporate Digital Responsibility strategy. Customer and vehicle safety is of utmost importance to the Porsche AG Group.\nThe company simultaneously has a clear focus on long-term customer satisfaction.\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct at Porsche AG summarizes the most important principles and expectations about acting lawfully, sustainably and with integrity at Porsche AG. For example, deal- ing with conflicts of interest, combating any form of corruption, appropriate behavior within the group and towards customers, business partners and public officials as well as taking responsi- bility for the environment and society.\nThe guidelines define and regulate the compliance requirements in three aspects:\n1. As a member of society: human rights; equal opportunities and equal treatment; product conformity and product safety; environmental protection; donations, sponsorships and char- ity; communication and marketing; political lobbying\n2. As a business partner: conflicts of interest; gifts, hospital- ity and invitations; prohibition of corruption; dealings with officials and holders of political office; prohibition of money laundering and terrorism financing; accounting and financial reporting; taxes and customs; fair and free competition; procurement; export control; prohibition of insider trading\n3. At the workplace: occupational safety and healthcare; data protection; security and protection of information, know- how and intellectual property; IT security; handling company assets\nThe additional Code of Conduct for Business Partners governs Porsche AG\u2019s expectation that its business partners will comply with the law as applicable, acknowledge the principles of ethical conduct and acting sustainably.\nThe Executive Board also adopted the company compli- ance management guideline. Porsche AG thus complies with its entrepreneurial responsibility and meets the statutory obligation to adhere to statutory requirements as well as internal guidelines.\nPorsche AG\u2019s compliance management system (CMS) forms the preventive framework for all principles, measures and processes not related to a specific person, which serve to ensure and implement compliance in six compliance topics. This aims to prevent breaches of the law and/or policy violations in these topics or to at least make them significantly more difficult.\nDue diligence process\nPorsche AG uses a compliance monitoring system to check adherence with specific compliance requirements relating to anti-corruption, anti-trust law and prevention of money launder- ing in the specialist departments. In addition to the areas listed, monitoring primarily focused on the implementation of risk-mit- igating measures in the reporting year. The identified potential for improvement has been included in the relevant departments\u2019 action plans. The monitoring also provided extensive findings for the CMS, which will be taken into account in Porsche AG\u2019s compliance program for 2023.\nPorsche AG also carries out compliance risk analyses in the compliance topics mentioned above. In the reporting year, Porsche AG continued these for other key departments.\nMeasures\nPorsche AG introduced the compliance management system in 2012. It covers all principles, measures and processes not related to a specific person, with which Porsche AG wants to ensure compliance and achieve the compliance goals men- tioned earlier.\nA compliance organization made up of the Chief Compliance Officer and those responsible for specific compliance topics is responsible for developing suitable targets and measures. The Chief Compliance Officer provides the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee with an annual report on the progress of implementing the CMS as well as on the significant measures and activities. According to the company compliance management guideline, the Executive Board of Porsche AG decides on the local set-up and further develop- ment of the CMS, based on a recommendation from the Chief Compliance Officer.\nIn 2022, compliance risk analyses were carried out in the compliance topics of active and passive corruption (including fraud, embezzlement and conflicts of interest), anti-trust law and prevention of money laundering at Porsche AG. These were also performed for six of Porsche AG\u2019s other main departments in the reporting year, whereby risk analyses were available\nfor 59 of 64 relevant main departments of Porsche AG by the end of 2022.\nThe preventive measures that have already been established mainly include the compliance requirements (e.g., guidelines for Porsche AG itself). There are also information and training ses- sions available for employees on relevant compliance topics as well as confidential compliance advice: Employees can ask any compliance-related questions at a centralized compliance help- desk. Furthermore, they have the possibility to report potential violations to an internal whistleblower system via fixed internal reporting channels. This whistleblower system is regulated in the group guideline of the same name. The two guidelines also explicitly bring the whistleblower system to people\u2019s attention. Porsche AG also publishes detailed information about this sys- tem on its intranet and the internet. Externally, two ombudsmen are available to employees, customers and business partners of Porsche AG as well as public officials or other external parties. They can be reached free of charge and at any time via various reporting channels and they also accept anonymous reports about potential violations.\nIn the reporting year 2022, those responsible for compliance topics carried out numerous communication measures at Porsche AG. There were also in-person and virtual appointments for employee training as well as digital learning modules at Porsche AG and the relevant German subsidiaries.\nResults\nWithin the compliance organization\u2019s work, the focus in 2022 again was on the specialist support of and participation in com- pliance projects of the Volkswagen Group as well as in initiatives and projects of Porsche AG.\nOnce again, the majority of the employee requests to the com- pliance helpdesk related to dealing with invitations and gifts. The number of reports of potential violations was up on the prior-year level.\nIn accordance with the group guideline on the prevention of money laundering, Porsche AG submitted three suspicious activity reports to the responsible anti-money laundering authorities in the reporting year.\nINTEGRITY\nTargets\nCorrect conduct only when there are laws, regulations and requirements in place is not sufficient for long-term success. If there are no explicit rules or if conflicting objectives arise, one needs integrity as an inner compass on how to act in the right way. The topic is also gaining in importance because increas- ingly shorter innovation cycles, a changing automotive industry and a dynamic environment require entrepreneurial speed more and more frequently.\nIntegrity management at Porsche AG has set itself the target of anchoring integrity in the corporate culture for the long term. Managers and employees should be able to act in accordance with ethical principles, with responsibility, from conviction and steadfastly. Porsche AG wants to strengthen the confidence of its employees, customers, shareholders and partners. In order to promote this value- and attitude-based culture in the best possible way, integrity management at Porsche AG is enshrined within the Human Resources portfolio in the Executive Board in Employee Development and Corporate Culture.\nIntegrity is a core value in the Porsche Code \u2014 the company\u2019s leadership model \u2014 and provides a solid basis for the organi- zation. The Porsche AG Code of Conduct not only emphasizes the importance of honest and ethical conduct and acting\nwith integrity on the part of each individual, but also explicitly highlights the role model function of members of the Executive Board and managers.\nDue diligence process\nIntegrity is firmly entrenched in the personnel processes on onboarding, recruiting, personnel development, remuneration and disciplinary actions. Minimum standards are determined in the group guideline on HR compliance.\nThe topic of culture and integrity was rolled out internationally at the Porsche AG Group by the Volkswagen Group as part of its Together4Integrity (T4I) program in 2018. These long-term measures aim to further strengthen the culture of integrity.\nThe package of measures and the implementation time may vary depending on the local circumstances. A central reporting system informs on the status of implementation of the projects in the relevant group companies. The status of implementation is also a regular reporting topic in the T4I meetings.\nIn addition, Porsche AG also uses results from the employee survey to derive measures for managing integrity. A poll about acting with integrity and compliant conduct is part of the annual mood barometer. Among other things, this gives insights into the development of the integrity culture. The results of the mood barometer are then discussed in the organizational units. This mandatory discussion slots into the team dialogues on culture and values in the company \u2014 a format in which manag- ers and employees work on measures to improve collaboration together. Training formats on the topic of integrity or with content on integrity are also available.\n    214\nCombined Management Report Non-Financial Statement 215\n\n\nThe report is published at the annual press conference of Porsche AG. The reporting period was from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.\nThe information in this report relates to the entire Porsche AG Group. If information only applies to individual areas, this is made explicitly clear. Unless indicated otherwise, all information relating to the Porsche AG Group also applies to Porsche AG. Besides Porsche AG, the Porsche AG Group encompasses\nall major national and international subsidiaries over which Porsche AG exercises direct or indirect control. Overall, the basis of consolidation consists of 114 fully consolidated companies, 28 of which are based in Germany and 86 abroad.\nExternal audit\n\u2192 GRI 2-5\nIn addition to careful data collection and recording via internal reporting and processing systems, as well as detailed inter-\nnal consolidation and inspection of the information and data contained therein, an independent audit was conducted on the consolidated financial statements and combined management report by Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (EY). The remuneration report 2022 has been prepared and audited by EY in accordance with the requirements of Section 162 AktG.\nPursuant to Section 289b (3) and Section 315b (3) HGB, EY conducted a voluntary business audit, in a limited assurance engagement, on the content of the non-financial statement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised).\nMore information is available in the \u2192 Auditor\u2019s opinion as well as the \u2192 Independent auditor\u2019s report on a limited assurance engagement to audit the non-financial statement.\nMaterial topics as part of the non-financial statement\nPorsche AG conducted a materiality analysis to identify material topics that contribute to the concerns defined under CSR-RUG and fall into the categories of environment, social, and corporate governance.\nThe following table contains the topics defined as material by Porsche AG, as well as their positions in the annual and sustain- ability report. All material topics are covered in the non-financial statement. The sustainability report contains information about the material topics beyond the minimum legal requirements. Moreover, Porsche AG reports in its sustainability report on topics that, although not identified as material, are relevant nonetheless.\n     REPORTING POLICY\nReporting structure\nThe two primary objectives of Porsche AG\u2019s activities are to accomplish economic success and take on responsibility \u2014 for sustainable activity, for secure jobs, and for society. Active practice, trust, and commitment are what set Porsche apart. It is therefore important to Porsche AG to make the public aware of business developments and its activities in connection with sustainability.\nAs such, this report encompasses the financial and sustainabil- ity reporting of the Porsche AG Group.\nChanges in reporting\nPorsche AG is subject to extended reporting obligations as a result of its IPO. The annual and sustainability report of the Porsche AG Group comprises three parts: the financial report (\u2192 pages 160\u2013371), the non-financial statement as part of the combined management report (\u2192 pages 188\u2013221), and the sus- tainability report (\u2192 page 72\u2013117).\nThe consolidated financial statements of Porsche AG as of December 31, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), as of the reporting date, as well as the supplementary regulations of Section 315e of Ger- many\u2019s Commercial Code (HGB). The combined management report is based on the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German accounting standards formalizing the requirements of the Commercial Code.\nThe non-financial statement relates to the subject areas of Sec- tion 289c HGB: environmental, employee, and social concerns, respect for human rights, and the fight against corruption and\nbribery. In accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), this text focuses on material topics that are necessary in order to understand the course of business, the business result, the position of the Porsche AG Group, and the impact of the Porsche AG Group on the non-financial aspects.\nFurthermore, Porsche AG is complying with the reporting obli- gations arising from Article 8 of the newly introduced Taxonomy Regulation (officially Regulation (EU) 2020/852) for the first time. The section entitled \u201cEU taxonomy\u201d has been integrated into the non-financial statement for the first time as a result.\nThe Porsche AG has prepared its annual and sustainability report in accordance with the current version of the GRI Sus- tainability Reporting Standards in 2021. The GRI content index can be found on \u2192 pages 391\u2013396. The GRI examined this content index in its entirety as part of its \u201cContent Index \u2014 Essentials\u201d service.\nFurthermore, Porsche follows the recommendations of the\nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\non effective climate-related reporting. The information on how climate-related opportunities and risks are handled is published as part of a TCFD index on \u2192 page 397.\nAdditionally, the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) has published the \u201cAutomobiles\u201d industry standard, on the basis of which companies are able to publish relevant indus- try-specific sustainability information for investors. The SASB index is presented from \u2192 page 400 onwards.\nPorsche AG has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2022. Therefore, the company reports on how it implements the 10 principles of the Global Compact into its business practices.\n\n\n\n\nReturn on investment\nThe return on investment represents the return on average invested capital for a particular period on the basis of the operating profit after tax. Invested capital is calculated as the operating assets reported in the balance sheet (property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, inventories, and receiv- ables) less non-interest-bearing liabilities (trade payables and payments on account received). The average invested capital is derived from the balance at the beginning and the end of the reporting period.\nReturn on sales\nThe return on sales of the Porsche AG Group is defined as the ratio of operating profit (before the financial result and taxes; EBIT) to sales revenue. The Executive Board of Porsche AG uses the return on sales to assess the operating profitability of the Porsche AG Group.\nS\nScalable Systems Platform (SSP)\nThe Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) is a cutting-edge mecha- tronics platform for all-electric vehicles. It is being developed by the Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen brands, as well as CARIAD for the software architecture. The high-performance version (SSP Sport) in particular is expected to support Porsche BEVs in the longer term.\nSecondary raw materials\nMaterials that are obtained from a recycling process. See recyclates.\nT\nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is an industry-led working group established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The task force helps companies under- stand and communicate the impacts of climate risks and oppor- tunities on their finances. The TCFD Recommendations Report provides companies with clear recommendations on voluntary, consistent reporting of climate-related financial disclosures. The purpose of this information is to enable creditors and insurers\nto assess and evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities appropriately.\nTax rate\nRatio of income tax to profit before tax.\nU\nUN Global Compact\nThe UN Global Compact is a global United Nations initiative that aims to build a sustainable, more inclusive economy for all. It wants to initiate change processes within companies and has a code of conduct for companies with 10 universal sustainability principles, especially relating to human rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and corruption prevention. Com- panies that take part in the UN Global Compact undertake to strategically align their business with these 10 principles and report on their progress at regular intervals.\nV\nValue Balancing Alliance\nThe Value Balancing Alliance is an alliance of multinational companies that aims to change the way in which companies measure their contributions. The Value Balancing Alliance wants to create a global standard for monetizing and disclosing the positive and negative impacts of corporate activity. It also wants to help organizations integrate these impacts into business steering. Porsche AG was a founding member in 2019.\nZ\nZero-Impact Factory\nThe Porsche AG Group\u2019s vision of a factory that has the smallest negative impact on the environment possible. The environmen- tal impact is to be reduced by means of selected KPIs and addi- tional qualitative criteria that are implemented in eleven fields of action. This way, the environmental impacts by Porsche\u2019s own production activities are to be reduced by 95% by 2030 com- pared to the 2018 baseline (or by 2040 for the development site in Weissach).\nThe image displays a table with information on compliance topics related to anti-corruption and anti-competitive behavior, specifically referencing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards from 2016 and 2021. Here\u2019s a detailed description of each section of the table:\n\n### Anti-corruption Section\n1. **GRI 3: Material Topics 2021**\n   - **3-3 Management of material topics**: This entry, numbered 115, 213, refers to the management approaches for material topics identified in the 2021 GRI standards.\n   \n2. **GRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016**\n   - **205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption**: Number 426 indicates the operational areas assessed for risks related to corruption. The note mentions that information is only partially available.\n   - **205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures**: Number 215, suggesting documentation or procedures in place for communication and training about anti-corruption, with no additional information or notes provided.\n\n### Anti-competitive Behavior Section\n1. **GRI 3: Material Topics 2021**\n   - **3-3 Management of material topics**: Repeats the earlier reference (115, 213) to the management of material topics.\n   \n2. **GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behavior 2016**\n   - **206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices**: Indicates the company\u2019s tracking of legal actions related to anti-competitive behaviors. The information is noted as not published for reasons of confidentiality.\n\n### General Observations\n- The table segments compliance into two critical areas: anti-corruption and anti-competitive behavior, reflecting the company's proactive approach to managing potential business risks and ensuring ethical operations.\n- The references to GRI standards highlight the organization\u2019s commitment to transparency and adherence to internationally recognized compliance frameworks.\n- However, the notation about partial availability or confidentiality of certain data suggests limits to the accessibility of full information regarding the company's compliance efforts or incidents, which is common in corporate reporting for sensitive issues.\n\nThis format and the data provided are likely part of an annual report or compliance disclosure document aimed at informing stakeholders about the organization\u2019s ongoing efforts to manage and mitigate compliance-related risks.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a short, precise and structured comprehensive analysis of the # ESG-REPORTING and check for compliance with # REGULATIONS regarding corruption and bribery prevention and detection.Use the uploaded instructions only.\n- Start with the name of the company whose ESG report is being analysed.\n -Prevention and Identification Measures: \nDescribe steps taken to prevent, identify, and address corruption and bribery incidents and risks.

Porsche AG wants its business partners to follow guideline of Conduct for Business Partners. \n - These guidelines specifically draws attention to Porsche AG's whistleblower programme. Moreover, Porsche AG has committed to ensure compliance with laws and norms by adopting the Compliance Management guidelines, which the Executive Board approved. It includes risk-oriented activities including arbitrary inspections of transactions that are significant in terms of compliance, in addition to management interviews. \n- During the reporting year, the\u00a0 communication was concentrated on intranet posts covering International Anti-Corruption Day and the updated Code of Conduct pamphlet. Additionally, the compliance officers used a variety of internal communications to managers, departmental groups, and info sessions.Workers have established and disseminated an internal whistleblower process through which they can report possible violations of the rules. \n- Employees and outside parties can report violations to two people who are obligated by German law to maintain professional secrecy. One can get in touch with these free, anonymous, internal and external whistleblower system points of contact in a number always. When acting on incoming reports, Porsche AG considers labour legislation, co-determination regulations, and data protection. Porsche AG puts whistleblowers to any disciplinary actions or other consequences. \n- Porsche AG responds to infractions that are found in accordance with co-determination, labour legislation, and data protection requirements. Whatever the investigation's conclusion, appropriate countermeasures are implemented case-by-case, and individual wrongdoing is dealt with according to the investigation's findings. The fact that each case is being looked into separately is not stated. The compliance officers at Porsche AG and a few chosen subsidiaries conduct compliance training in collaboration with the HR division. The foundation is a subject-specific plan that determines the important content areas and pertinent target audiences through risk analyses. \n- New hires, managers, and junior managers must complete required training programmes. Additionally, the compliance officers arrange for organised training for particular departments and target audiences on subjects that are required by law, current events, or upon request.\n - 7,337 participants received compliance training through digital training modules, while 5,817 workers of Porsche AG and its pertinent German subsidiaries received compliance training through in-person and virtual events throughout the reporting year. 7,458 employees of Porsche AG's relevant German companies and 17,296 employees of Porsche AG completed the digital Code of Conduct training module. \n- In addition to covering the directive of the same name, this training module offers specifics on the whistleblower system and the compliance assistance desk's contact information. The topics of the \"Human rights\" and \"Avoidance of conflicts of interest and corruption\" rules are also covered in the course. By the end of the reporting year, Porsche AG and its relevant German subsidiaries had an average of 93% of the target group's training in face-to-face and virtual events for the defined areas of compliance. \nThe only thing not stated is how frequently the trainings occur. The frequency and scope of trainings are not mentioned as well as the independent investigation process. Therefore, the G1-3 regulations are partly met."}]}

This Committee reviews the operational activities of the Corporate ESG Committee, a cross-functional team with representatives from across the Company. The Corporate ESG Committee is led by our Head of ESG Strategy under the direction of the Executive Committee. The ESG Committee is responsible for developing and gaining approval for our sustainability strategy and driving the implementation. The Executive Committee is provided updates on a quarterly basis while the Supervisory Board is informed at least twice a year.\nTo anchor sustainability further in the organization, a mandatory ESG Foundational Course was launched in 2022 for all employees. The course provides an overview of ESG initiatives and helps employees understand their role in making the company\u2014and ultimately the world\u2014a better place. Refer to information in the chapter on employee training for additional insight. This training is followed by an \u201cESG deep dive\u201d class that helps QIAGEN management understand the following objectives:\n\u2022 To create more sustainable economic value, organizations should strive to make a reasonable profit taking all stakeholders into consideration;\n\u2022 To create more environmental value, organizations need to think about their greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint and other environmental impacts and work to address these issues profitably; and\n\u2022 To create more social value, companies should consider the communities and cultures in which they operate as important stakeholders whose health and well-being should be protected.\nStakeholder engagement\nWe regard dialogue with our stakeholders as a central element in the development of our company and the achievement of our long-term vision. We are aware that the shift toward a more sustainable economy and society requires intensive dialogue and cooperation between various stakeholder groups.\nWe proactively engage with our stakeholders around the world, in particular with our investors and shareholders, financial authorities and regulators. Our engagement also involves other important stakeholders including our employees, customers, suppliers and regulators. We welcome this engagement and see these discussions as a way to identify important trends and developments in society and in our business fields. We take the outcomes of these discussions into account when shaping our business strategy as well as our sustainability agenda and objectives.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nOur Approach to Sustainability Environmental Responsibility Invest in People\nServing Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\nEU Taxonomy\nESG performance at a glance Detailed Tax Disclosure\nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD Index\nStakeholder group\nEmployees Customers\nShareholders and the financial community\nSuppliers\nGeneral society and local communities Banks and financial institutions\nReporting Scope\nFormats of engagement\nESG and employee trainings, regular one-on-one review sessions, 180\u00b0 feedback process, surveys (e.g., sustainability, diversity & inclusion)\nSurveys (e.g., on sustainability, customer satisfaction), web chat, service portal with 24/7 follow-up, conferences, trade fairs, bilateral engagement, production tours, VIP days in our facilities, questionnaires (e.g., EcoVadis)\nQuarterly reports and quarterly earnings calls, Annual Report, live broadcast of all parts of the Annual General Meeting with access to appointed proxies in advance of the meeting, regular roadshows and calls, investor relations website\nStrategic reviews, supplier days, workshops, bilateral engagement, initiatives, video conferences including employees\nIndustry-specific forums and conferences, proactive communication with local and national press, local engagement, engagement in more than 50 joint healthcare projects in more than 30 countries.\nMandatory reporting and information (e.g., Annual Report, non-financial reporting), bilateral meetings\nTopics we engage on\nHealth & safety, culture, inclusion & diversity, innovation, employee development, company strategy and organizational topics\nESG strategy and targets, decarbonization, minimizing plastics, quality, and product safety\nESG strategy and targets, access to healthcare, and corporate governance topics\nSustainability performance, quality and product safety, responsible sourcing standards\nAccess to healthcare, business support\nSustainability performance, ESG-linked financing\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 7\n                       The basis for the non-financial reporting in the Report by the Managing Board is Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Non-financial reporting requirements are further defined in the EU Non-financial Reporting Directive (2014) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (in effect as of 2024), including the EU Taxonomy (partially in effect as of 2022) and the proposed EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (in effect as of 2024).\nMateriality analysis\nIn 2022, we conducted a materiality analysis to identify sustainability topics of relevance to our business, society and the environment. Our first step was to create a long-list of potential material topics by reviewing internal data such as last year\u2019s materiality analysis. We analyzed the sector-specific regulations and standards of the draft of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the reporting standards provided by Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the relevant guidance issued by Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) as well as ratings and rankings. We further considered feedback from our investors, partners, suppliers, and customers as well as results from a comprehensive ESG-benchmark assessment we conducted in the reporting year. The long-list was then refined to a final short-list of twenty-one topics.\nNext, we evaluated each topic in terms of two perspectives: i) the impact of our business activity on a particular topic (inside-out perspective) and ii) the impact of the topic on assets, financial and the profitability of QIAGEN (outside-in perspective). This involved conducting interviews with each manager familiar with sustainability issues at QIAGEN. Thereafter, we considered the results of ratings and analyses. The results were then discussed, validated, and partially adapted by the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board.\nThrough this process, we derived a total of eleven topics that can be classified as material regarding both our impact on the environment and society and in terms of their relevance to our business. Each topic is attributed to one of the four missions \u201cEnvironmental Responsibility,\u201d \u201cInvest in People,\u201d \u201cServing Societies,\u201d or \u201cBusiness with Integrity.\u201d Listed below are our material topics with a selection of opportunities and risks for QIAGEN.\n\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 8\n   Possible risks (selection)\n Loss of revenue due to reputational loss and de- listing as supplier if other suppliers can deliver with less plastic.\n Increasing costs due to regulations and dependencies on third parties as well as decreasing revenue due to reputational loss.\n Staff absenteeism due to illness leads to production stops or delays, and reputation loss.\n Increased costs and decreased revenue due to high employee attrition, drop in job performance and lower productivity.\n Higher costs and less revenue due to less qualified staff, repetitive recruitment and trainings and less productivity and innovation.\n Lower revenue due to loss in market position, low reputation and employee retention.\n Decreasing revenue due to decreasing customer loyalty and trust, lower standing and less access to talented workforce.\n Increased costs and loss of revenue due to regulatory requirements and decreased trustworthiness.\n Negative impact on workers, decreasing revenue and increased costs due to fines and penalties, loss of reputation and drop out of suppliers.\n Increased costs and loss of capital due to reputational damage and compliance issues.\n Loss of revenue due to disruptive cyber events and loss of crucial data, market share and legal fines.\n Environmental, Social and Governance\n\nReduce, recycle and replace plastic\nMinimize Carbon Footprint\nOccupational Health & Safety\nDiversity & Inclusion\nEmployee Attraction & Development\nAccess to Healthcare\nCustomer Satisfaction\nQuality and Product Safety\nAnti-Corruption and Anti-Trust\nGovernance, Risk and Controls\nData and Cyber Security\nConnection to European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)\nE5: Resource Use and Circular\nE1: Climate Change\nS1: Own Workforce S1: Own Workforce\nS1: Own Workforce\nS2: Workers in the value chain S3: Affected communities\nS4: Consumers and End-Users G1: Business Conduct\nS4: Consumers and End-Users S4: Consumers and End-Users G1: Business Conduct\nG1: Business Conduct\nS1: Own Workforce\nS4: Consumers and End-Users\nPossible opportunities (selection)\nImproved reputation and increasing revenue opportunities due to higher demand for products without plastic.\nSecure and stable energy supply due to regenerative energy sources and sustainable contract conditions as well as protection of the climate and of ecosystems.\nGood employee health leads to increased efficiency, a higher external recognition and less insurance and litigation costs.\nIncreased level of creativity as well as high employee motivation and satisfaction which has a positive impact on innovation potential, reputation and market development.\nBeing an attractive Employer Brand leads to attraction of highly skilled workers and increased revenue due to higher efficiency and skill level.\nImproved health and well-being of populations in line with UN SDG goals and higher revenue due to ESG Ratings and good reputation.\nIncreasing customer loyalty leads to financial success and allows for innovation and business extension.\nContribution to global health and increased revenue due to brand image and positive recognition by our customers.\nGood governance simplifies access to capital from banks and investors and stabilizes revenue due to a good reputation as a business partner.\nEffective decision making due to diverse management composition.\nHigher revenue due to resilient products and establishing high confidence as a quality leader, protection of (sensitive) data.\n    Economy\n                    Serving Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\n                 The results of the materiality analysis led us to adapt the structure of our Corporate ESG Committee to enable better coordination of the individual topics. In subsequent workshops, specialist departments carried out a detailed analysis of the maturity levels of each material topic to develop concrete roadmaps and action plans for achieving our goals.\n\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 18\n  Environmental, Social and Governance\nOur Approach to Sustainability Environmental Responsibility Invest in People\nServing Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\nEU Taxonomy\nESG performance at a glance Detailed Tax Disclosure\nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD Index\npolicies which aim to incorporate our culture and values into all our internal and external relationships. These policies are communicated to all employees when they first join QIAGEN, and are reviewed for any necessary updates on an annual basis. Employees may access these policies at any time via the company intranet.\n\u2022 QIAGEN's Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics provides our employees with a clear understanding of the principles of business conduct and ethics that are expected of them.\n\u2022 QIAGEN's Ethical Standards Policy defines our cultural norms and values as defined in our mission, vision, and identity. Our values form the basis of our business success and every employee is expected to treat everyone in an open, honest, and respectful manner.\n\n                              In 2021, we introduced an initiative to foster inclusive networks and inspire a culture of empowerment. We call this initiative EMPOWER and it was launched by more than 100 voluntary ambassadors who facilitated approximately 300 workshops with close to 3,500 employees participating globally. The workshops were structured to anchor the EMPOWER principles into our day-to-day activities and discussions were focused around both our strengths as well as key areas to improve. As a result of the workshops, approximately 400 team action items were targeted with approximately 97% completed in 2022. Key practices in human resources have been updated to embed this culture of empowerment into the development of our employees, including within our 360\u00b0 feedback process, called QIAlead, our Pulse Check questionnaires and across all leadership programs.\nEmployee development and training\nWe seek to inspire our people to grow, so they have the right mindset, behaviors and skills to thrive and achieve organizational goals and objectives. With our focus on performance management, employee, career and leadership development we foster individual and organizational effectiveness to support achieving QIAGEN\u2019s commitment. Our formal coaching guidelines to EMPOWER every employee and encourage them taking responsibility for their own learning, growth and career development.\nAs part of our talent and succession management, we have established transparent career paths with the QIAGEN Profile Navigator. It defines jobs, core competencies and approaches to advancement across the global organization. In addition, our global Performance Enhancement System creates a clear framework of regular one-on-one review sessions for each employee and their manager to discuss career development. These include discussions of goals and achievement levels, assessment of relevant competencies, as well as training needs and career planning steps. They are held on a mandatory basis at least once a year.\nWe consider high-quality training and career development to be an integral part of our success. We offer various training opportunities via our global e-learning platform QIAlearn as well as in person trainings or trainings offered in a hybrid format. Training focuses on job-specific skills, compliance, competencies, and leadership development. Most trainings continue to be conducted virtually. During 2022, employees completed more than 40,000 virtual instructor-led and e-learning courses.\n\nAs part of the professional development, we also offered in 2022 a Mentorship Exchange program to support QIAGENers in their development journey. The Mentorship Exchange program is a powerful, evidence-based internal mentorship program that pairs employees across the organization. In 2022, we had 256 participants.\nOur success is based on having leaders with the capability to lead in an ever-changing work environment. We need to ensure that we remain competitive, innovative and prepared for the future so that we not only adapt to a world that is changing rapidly, but proactively anticipate and drive the changes ourselves. As part of our continued leadership development, in 2022 we launched our newly designed, interactive and blended training journey program called \u201cCultivate\u201d for new Managers in EMEA and the U.S. There is a strong focus on self-directed learning, online and in-person workshops and discussion groups to build leadership and management networks across the organization.\nAs part of the feedback mechanism for continuous improvement to individual leadership competencies, an annual 180\u00b0 feedback process provides the opportunity for employees and supervisors to give anonymized feedback to managers. In case of unsatisfying feedback, a formal process is in place to follow up with specific solutions. In 2022, we rolled out a pilot for 360\u00b0 feedback, which we are currently developing further.\nIn addition, in 2022 on our online learning platform, QIAlearn, we launched a global online new hire onboarding portal for new employees joining the company as well as anyone new to a managerial role. The path contains several e-learnings which employees can work through at their own pace.\nDiversity\nDiverse teams strengthen our organization through the variety of ideas, perspectives and approaches they bring to our business. Our teams perform best when they are composed of individuals with the widest possible range of personalities, backgrounds, and traits. At QIAGEN, we are committed to creating an environment that is rich in diversity and empowers all employees. We actively work to ensure we provide an environment where all individuals have the equal opportunity to grow and contribute, regardless of their age, educational background, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, ethnicity, veteran status, physical abilities, or religion. Our diversity is a strength and makes QIAGEN a great place to work. We leverage this strength through our Executive Council of Equal Opportunity (ECEO), our diversity council that oversees our diversity and inclusion (D&I) initiatives.\nThe ECEO strives to ensure QIAGEN policies, practices and procedures are conducive to recruiting, retaining, educating, and developing a diverse, high-performing workforce that draws from all segments of society. It values fairness, diversity, and inclusion, and aims to foster an environment that attracts the best talent, values diversity of life experiences and perspectives, and encourages innovation. The ECEO is comprised of volunteers from across the company: executives, management, and individual contributors. The cross-functional approach to membership allows multiple perspectives and experiences to be included in the overall advancement of QIAGEN\u2019s diversity goals. The council consists of a minimum of six advisory board members and a minimum of four council members with a co-chair leadership structure that reports to an Executive Committee Sponsor. Globally agreed, cross-functional objectives are tied directly to our corporate goals on D&I and the ECEO drives and communicates initiatives within each organizational area and sponsors our D&I ambassador program and the QIAGEN Communities, our employee resource groups.\nOur diversity ambassadors are comprised of employee volunteers who champion D&I across our global sites through various activities such as hosting site and region- specific speakers and presentations, and organizing trainings, workshops, and events to educate the community within QIAGEN and beyond. In 2022, the ambassadors hosted events to educate and celebrate Juneteenth in the U.S., promote awareness on anxiety and depression, and support the LGBTQIA+ community through participation in local Pride parades and engaging in conversations about allyship.\n\nIn May 2022, following a series of discussions, surveys, and focus groups, we introduced QIAGEN communities, our employee resource groups. These four groups are all volunteer-led and focus on: (1) disability, mental health, and well-being through Thrive@QIAGEN, (2) parents and caregivers through QIAGEN Parents and Caregivers Community (QPACC), (3) LGBTQIA+ through Pride@QIAGEN and (4) women through QIAwomen.\nIn 2018, we started our strategic initiative on gender diversity with a focus on improving the number of women in management. The participation of women in management roles increased from approximately 28% in 2018 to 35% in 2022 (2021: 34%) because of strategic initiatives to drive awareness, engagement, and development of better gender representation among our management team. We continue to work towards gender parity and are targeting a 2023 goal of 36% or more women in management roles and it is our goal to achieve at least 40% of women in management in the mid-term in accordance with our Gender Diversity Policy. More information about the policy on diversifying the Management Board and the Supervisory Board can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.\nIn 2022, QIAwomen hosted events featuring both internal and external speakers to share experiences and promote discussion. These included on-site events in support of the UN\u2019s campaign to end violence against women. These gave participants the opportunity to exchange resources and, in the US, support a local charity for survivors of domestic violence. Launched in July 2022, QIAwomen has grown to more than 300 members. For the second consecutive year, QIAGEN has been listed on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI), which provides an opportunity for companies to assess progress towards parity, benchmark against peers and highlight a commitment to gender equality. QIAGEN also endorses the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, as expressed between the UN Global Compact and UN Women. These principles emphasize the business case for corporate action to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.\nOur commitment to diversity extends beyond cultural and gender diversity. In 2021 we made a targeted review of all our policies and guidelines and updated them to ensure clarity and confirmation of our commitment to equality for LGBTQ+ workers and their families, including joining the Business Coalition for the Equality Act. As a result of these updates, as well as of other initiatives focused on the LGBTQ+ community during the year, our U.S. subsidiary received a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index (CEI). We aim to continue our participation in this program and have been actively assessing the new criteria being introduced for the 2023 CEI. The Pride@QIAGEN community was launched in June 2022 over 150 members. The community hosted virtual and in-person events in support of pride month activities in the U.S., Poland, Germany, Mexico, and the U.K., and held several virtual discussions to engage outside of pride month and share ways to support the LGBTQIA+ community throughout the year. QIAGEN also endorses the Standards of Conduct for Business: Tackling Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, & Intersex People which builds on the UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights.\nDuring 2022, we further focused on disability and assessed which targeted areas we could identify for improvement through a project team assembled as part of our leadership training program. The project team identified key areas to review such as hiring and retention strategies for onboarding differently-abled candidates, improving information accessibility and visibility within QIAGEN and extending our outreach in our local communities. Our Thrive@QIAGEN employee resource group has grown to almost 200 members since it launched in July 2022 and hosted an event championing well-being and inclusion in the workplace. In 2022, we participated for the first time in the Global Diversity Equality Index (GDEI) and will use the results as a scorecard and benchmark to identify and implement specific actions to better support our differently-abled employees.\n\nSupport for local initiatives\nWe support a broad range of activities in communities where our businesses are based. Our expanded Global Donation and Sponsorship Policy and new Global Donation Committee was successfully implemented at the beginning of 2022 to streamline and scale-up our activities and to routinely track our level of sponsorships and donations across the organization. Our activities include sponsorship of science education, disease awareness campaigns, the installation of school laboratories and promotion of biology in school curricula. Our local engagement goes beyond financial support, and we collaborate with the local Rotary Club to help integrate refugees from Syria, Ukraine (see below) and other war-torn countries through a program that includes language training and cultural orientation, assessment centers, and internships at QIAGEN.\nOur Hilden site also works with Hephata, a local institution for citizens with disabilities, who undertake a broad range of operational tasks for the company, including certain packaging and production responsibilities.\nIn North America, our employees are granted eight hours of paid community service time per year, and contributed volunteer time to meeting community needs. Our Community Service Committee mobilizes volunteers and provides company funds for projects that improve the lives of people locally and nationally.\n~6,200 passionate QIAGENers around the world\nPeople from all functions working together to achieve our vision: Making improvements in life possible\n       \n\nWhen Ukraine was invaded in February 2022, QIAGEN immediately mobilized to provide healthcare and humanitarian support for the affected population as well as for refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. This included organizing a company-wide donation effort channeling resources to local institutions and global ones including Project Hope and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\nAdditionally, local teams based in Poland organized near weekly supplies delivered first to Ukraine and then to refugees who left all behind. Many of our colleagues drove almost ten hours to the border to bring refugees to a safe place and often hosted them at home.\nFinally, members of the QIAGEN GPHTF met with representatives of the Ukraine Ministry of Health, Public Health Centre, and the Global Fund, to discuss product-based donations for human ID and forensic equipment in support of identifying missing persons and war crimes investigation, TB control, and mitigating the spread of other diseases such as cholera and polio as a result to the disruption in healthcare services brought about by the invasion.\nBusiness with Integrity\nBusiness Ethics and Anti-corruption\nIn conducting responsible business, we are consistently mindful of the ethical foundations of QIAGEN in our day-to-day business operations. This means, in particular, the respect for human rights and legally compliant business behavior.\nEthics in clinical studies\nClinical studies are essential to evaluate the performance and clinical value of our regulated clinical diagnostic tests. This information is required by regulatory authorities to gain marketing approval. More importantly we are committed to bringing high performance products to the market, and this can only be achieved by establishing the performance characteristics of a potential product according to its intended use. Therefore, we and our partners conduct clinical studies for our diagnostics tests that are to be approved for use as in vitro diagnostics in a patient care pathway. In the conduct of these studies, we commit to ensuring the well-being, safety, ethical concerns, and legal rights of the study volunteers.\nIn light of this, we have built global procedures for the conduct of clinical studies which abide by the following principles:\n\u2022 the Declaration of Helsinki: this is a statement of ethical principles that was developed by the World Medical Association to guide medical research WMA Declaration of Helsinki \u2013 Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects \u2013 WMA \u2013 The World Medical Association\n\u2022 the International Conference on Harmonization and national Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines\n\u2022 ISO 20916: In vitro diagnostic medical devices \u2014 Clinical performance studies using specimens from human subjects \u2014Good study practice\nAll investigators and staff involved in QIAGEN studies must be suitably qualified for their role and have a current GCP certificate, which aims to prepare research staff in the conduct of clinical trials with human participants and is renewed biannually. Hence, laboratories are only accessible to employees that are qualified and trained to enter using an access card entry system. Eligible studies must be approved by ethics committees or the Institutional Review Board prior to starting, and if required, have the appropriate regulatory approvals from authorities in the country in which the study is being conducted. We use residual (left-over) patient samples whenever possible, minimizing the need to actively collect samples from patients. Where active participation by volunteers in studies is needed, we obtain informed consent by providing volunteers, in accordance with best practice, with a comprehensive overview of the study including its risks and benefits and alternative options for the patient.\n\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 34\n  Environmental, Social and Governance\nOur Approach to Sustainability Environmental Responsibility Invest in People\nServing Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\nEU Taxonomy\nESG performance at a glance Detailed Tax Disclosure\nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD Index\nAppropriate guidelines, such as ISO20916, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and direct feedback and guidance documents from regulatory authorities, are followed when designing QIAGEN clinical studies. This is to ensure the integrity of study design, adherence to sound scientific principles and that high quality data is generated, while the risk to volunteers is minimized.\nWe convene a monthly Medical Safety Committee, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, to oversee study and patient risk, and to assess any adverse event or device event reports, which are then appropriately reviewed and reported to authorities (e.g., FDA, European Competent Authorities, dependent on study location) when required.\nPersonally identifiable data that we collect during the conduct of QIAGEN studies is kept confidential in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. We issue all volunteers with unique subject identification numbers to de-identify patient data, ensuring we meet the requirement for data privacy. For transparency and accessibility of clinical performance data of QIAGEN clinical diagnostic tests, QIAGEN undertakes to:\n\u2022 register relevant studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov., a resource provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine; \u2022 publish studies in peer-reviewed publications in an anonymized fashion.\nEthical use of genetic editing\nGenome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 are revolutionizing life science research and have the potential to prevent and treat many diseases. QIAGEN\u2019s solutions are used in almost every laboratory conducting CRISPR and other gene modification. While such technologies can enable major advances in life science research, we truly appreciate the complex ethical considerations of using such technology as well as the need for clear guidelines and policies.\nAt QIAGEN, we fully support the careful development of guidelines by scientific and societal leaders, with involvement and transparency for diverse elements of society with a stake in the issue. Tight regulations and ethical rules about the use of genome editing are necessary to prevent misconduct and avoid harm to people and the ecosystem in which we live. We endorse the principles and proposals of scientific organizations and advisory groups \u2013 such as the American Society of Human Genetics and the European Society of Human Genetics - that have issued cautionary guidelines.\nIn 2019, leading scientists and ethicists from seven countries called for an international moratorium on all clinical uses of human germline editing to produce genetically modified children. These leaders are asking for a fixed-period ban on changing heritable human DNA (in sperm, eggs or embryos) to make genetically modified offspring. QIAGEN strongly agrees with the moratorium and requires compliance according to our Human Rights Policy. All employees who become aware or have suspicions of customers using our products in a non-compliant manner in this field are required to notify our Head of Legal and Compliance in accordance with our policy on Ethical Issues in Gene Typing.\nEthical product use\nWe endorse the application of our products, our services, and our operations in compliance with human rights principles and codes such as the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Many of our products, such as DNA or RNA extraction kits, have an intended use for a broad range of research and diagnostic applications, including COVID-19, oncology testing and forensics. None of them are designed for population screening, but we acknowledge that it is technically possible to operate our products for this purpose. As per our Human Rights Policy, we do not tolerate the misuse of our products for purposes such as mass screening and surveillance of ethnic minorities, and we will block customers involved in such practices from further sales should this become known to us. However, as we operate via distributors in many countries, we have no means of monitoring the identity of all our customers or control the use of our products by end-customers.\n\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 38\n  Environmental, Social and Governance\nOur Approach to Sustainability Environmental Responsibility Invest in People\nServing Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\nEU Taxonomy\nESG performance at a glance Detailed Tax Disclosure\nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD Index\nOur compliance program includes a broad range of policies including, but not limited to, aspects such as conflicts of interest, insider trading, revenue recognition, confidentiality, and social media. Policies regarding interactions with healthcare professionals are fully compliant with the AdvaMed Code of Ethics and are described in detail in our Global Sales and Marketing Policy that includes guidelines on samples, gifts etc. Moreover, we do not make or receive any payments to or from political parties or political action committees. Such actions have been prohibited without exception by our Code of Conduct since its establishment in 1996. QIAGEN is a member of a number of industry trade associations such as AdvaMedDx (U.S.) and MedTech (Europe) which work to advance important healthcare related initiatives with governmental and non-governmental organizations. We also collaborate with global health policy institutions such as the World Health Organization and regional consortia such as the African Society for Laboratory Medicine to improve affordable access to testing solutions for neglected diseases in low-resource settings. Besides our engagement in industry associations, we are not active in any direct lobbying activities.\nWe pay special attention to antitrust and anti-corruption laws. Our specific antitrust and anti-corruption policies support our commitment to ensure that we abide by the antitrust and anti-corruption laws of the countries in which we operate. Our policies on anti-trust and anti-corruption can be found on our Compliance webpage under Investor Relations. We extend our Compliance Program not only to our management and employees, but also to third-party intermediaries such as distributors or agents. Our third-party due diligence program, which is administered by our Global Compliance Manager, focuses on our local distributors and agents and contains the following six elements:\n(1) pre-screening, anti-corruption questionnaire and certification for new distributors, resellers, and agents;\n(2) annual risk assessment of selected third parties based on a calculated risk score, which factors in location of business and Corruption Perceptions Index;\n(3) annual audits of the anti-corruption program and third-party risk management conducted by internal and external auditors;\n(4) training for third-party distributors;\n(5) contractual obligation to comply with applicable laws (including anti-corruption laws) and QIAGEN's Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy as well as compliance certification; and\n(6) due diligence in the form of annual background checks of random selection of third parties and ongoing monitoring.\nAll our compliance policies are available to employees through the intranet. Each policy includes a contact address and the invitation to comment or to ask questions. Our employees' awareness of compliance is increased by regular in-person trainings, which are held by external as well as in-house legal and regulatory experts. We also offer an online training program focusing on topics such as antitrust and competition, bribery and corruption, conflicts of interest, data protection, gifts and entertainment, harassment, insider trading, reporting as well as respectful communication.\nOnline training is provided to all employees with offerings in multiple languages and supported by multiple communication resources. All new employees are required to take online training on our Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics and to confirm that they have read and understood the Code. Additional training customized to the specific area of responsibility is mandatory. Employees in sales and marketing as well as upper management are required to complete training on anti-corruption and antitrust laws. These basic trainings are followed by regular refresher courses (depending on the course, from quarterly to every three years). In 2022, our employees completed more than 15,000 compliance course enrollments. In addition, employees are informed through our intranet and regular updates on compliance topics via our internal communication platform Yammer and our quarterly Compliance Newsletter. During 2022, each employee was offered the opportunity to take cyber security, master data governance, and health & safety near miss prevention trainings as required.\n\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 39\n  Environmental, Social and Governance\nOur Approach to Sustainability Environmental Responsibility Invest in People\nServing Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\nEU Taxonomy\nESG performance at a glance Detailed Tax Disclosure\nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD Index\nWe provide a hotline for reporting accounting-related concerns anonymously and in good faith. In accordance with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the NYSE, we follow a strict non-retaliation policy. We will diligently investigate all such complaints and will protect the anonymity of the complainant to ensure protection from retaliation as well as to secure the employment status of the complainant. We also offer a direct email and telephone hotline for employees to address questions or make suggestions for our Compliance Program.\nData and cyber security\nIn the light of the external threat landscape, that evolved further during the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in the Ukraine, the new realities of a remote workforce and an increasingly hostile cyber space, managing cyber security risk remains a priority. We are committed to and continue to make considerable investments to enhance the cyber resilience of our organization, products and services, and to preserve the trust of our customers, partners and employees.\nOur data and cyber security-related processes are based on the ISO 27001 standard as well as on the \"Standard of Good Practice for Information Security 2020\", which is used to improve resilience against the ever-changing threat landscape. Global cyber security and privacy requirements are actively monitored for and discussed as part of our Cyber Security Council as well as during Data Protection committee meetings, both held quarterly. Cyber security risks are managed as part of our Enterprise Risk Management and regularly reported to the Audit Committee. Refer to further discussion in our Management Report under Risk Management.\nOur cyber security program ensures that data and cyber security efforts and initiatives reflect evolving business requirements, regulatory guidance, and emerging threats. We have supporting privacy and cyber security policies and guidelines in place, which are reviewed and approved as part of QIAGEN\u2019s Cyber Security Council and Compliance Committee procedures. These documents are available to all employees on QIAGEN\u2019s intranet, and we offer further mandatory trainings on a regularly basis, during which we carry out knowledge checks to ensure that the content was understood by the trainees. We also conduct regular 'phishing' simulations, awareness webinars and workshops on important security topics, as well as role specific trainings. In addition, the Cyber Security team regularly conducts incident response exercises to evaluate the organizations established procedures, including an analysis of each applicable incident response stage.\nWe are working with the Council for Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) certified partners to conduct regular, at least annual, security assessments of our infrastructure. To facilitate information and knowledge exchange, QIAGEN has joined well-known industry and governmental cyber security communities like the Information Security Forum (ISF), Allianz fuer CyberSicherheit and Health-ISAC.\nOur Cyber Security team pro-actively monitors for exposed weaknesses in the organization's systems and services. QIAGEN\u2019s threat and vulnerability management program covers our global networks, digital workplaces, and cloud environments with state-of-the-art security controls. To our knowledge, we did not experience any material cyber security incidents or material breaches of customer data privacy, cases of data theft or data loss related to customer data in 2022. We also did not record any well-founded privacy complaints with Data Protection Authorities.\nSustainable supply chain management\nWe strive to ensure that our quality standards, compliance with laws and regulations as well as environmental and social standards are maintained along the entire value chain of suppliers and partners. We demand the same high standards from our business partners. Our supplier policy includes specific requirements for corporate governance, environmental and social standards, to which we expect our suppliers to adhere as minimum standards. Among other issues, it includes obligations to reduce the use of substances of concern, to ensure collective bargaining and freedom of association among employees, fair wages, and regulations concerning maximum working time. The supplier policy, which is our external policy for our supply base, is available online on our website under sustainability.\n\nIntegrating sustainability throughout the value chain\nNON\uf6baFINANCIAL STATEMENT 2022 40\n  Environmental, Social and Governance\nOur Approach to Sustainability Environmental Responsibility Invest in People\nServing Societies\nBusiness with Integrity\nEU Taxonomy\nESG performance at a glance Detailed Tax Disclosure\nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD Index\nIn alignment with our policies, chief among which is our Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics, every employee is required to conduct themselves honestly, fairly, and objectively in all business relationships with suppliers and all others with whom QIAGEN maintains business relationships. Our compliance training program ensures that employees in the procurement organization understand our guidelines and comply with them. The training is mandatory, and in 2022, 78% of new hires completed the training. Our procurement policy, which is our internal policy, is available on our website under sustainability.\n              Resources\nSupplier\nTransport\nManufacturing\nTransport\nCustomer\nDisposal\nExamples of sustainability in product design\n\u2022Avoiding materials that cause a lot of damage when they are mined, cannot be recycled or do not decompose \u2022Improving repairability, longevity, and allowing for reuse\n\u2022Designing products to use less energy and produce less waste for customers\n\u2022Optimizing recycling by making it easy to separate materials\nStructure of our supply chain\nWe operate in more than 35 locations worldwide, and our sites are supported by a global supplier network that includes approximately 6,500 (2021: 8,300) suppliers in 71 (2021: 70) countries, supplying resources such as chemicals and bioreagents, plastics, packaging materials, as well as other materials and services essential to our business. In 2022, 95% (2021: 75%) of our overall purchasing volume came from OECD countries.\n\n\nTo minimize compliance, environmental and social risks in our supply chain, we apply a multi-stage vendor selection process. Suppliers are subjected to a risk analysis regarding environmental and social criteria based on their geographic location. These criteria were supported by information from the MVO Netherlands platform financed by the Dutch Foreign Ministry, as well as the Bertelsmann Stiftung\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals Index in 2020. This analysis identified no suppliers for whom potential risks exist due to geographic location and sales to QIAGEN.\nIn 2022, we shared our new supplier policy with all our suppliers, and it is included in our terms and conditions. In 2022, suppliers representing 95% of our purchasing volume have signed our supplier policy as a mandatory part of the contracting process. Beginning in 2023, all suppliers that accept our purchase orders agree to comply with our supplier policy. The policy contains requirements regarding legal compliance, anti-bribery and corruption, labor rights, free speech, right of assembly, non- discrimination and fair treatment, health, and safety as well as environmental protection and conservation. We provide an anonymous whistleblower hotline which can be used by all employees. The contact details can be found on our website within our Anti-corruption Policy. In addition, as part of our quality agreements with the suppliers, first-tier suppliers must confirm REACH, RoHS and conflict mineral compliance as appropriate.\nAs part of our supplier selection process, we conduct additional assessments. Some suppliers are analyzed with a supplier risk assessment. This includes all strategic suppliers with a high critical impact on QIAGEN\u2019s security of supply. The analysis is based on the following criteria, among others: quality management, financial stability, embargoes, risks of natural disaster. This process is currently in evaluation against further criteria in context with evolving compliance, environmental and social standards. The relevant data for the assessment is either submitted via a questionnaire, or the suppliers are assessed on site during a visit. Though it has not yet occurred, if a supplier does not fulfil all criteria, next steps would be decided on an individual basis.\nQuality audits are conducted on site at least every three years for all \u201cA\u201d-categorized suppliers. We document all audits and share the results with the audited suppliers. The majority of our audits result in minor, rarely major findings, in the quality processes of our suppliers. In case of non-conformity with respect to quality processes, corrective actions are delivered to the supplier and followed up until effective implementation.\nOur subsidiary in Hilden, Germany will be subject to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtgesetz) effective as of January 1, 2024. The new law will impose due diligence requirements on our supply chain. To effectively address the wide-ranging challenges of a sustainable supply chain and to meet the legal requirements as well as our own ambitions, we plan to realize a number of measures in 2023, such as the publication of our human rights strategy on our corporate website, or the refinement of our risk analysis and prevention measures. In our approach, we not only focus on assessments and audits, but also on a partnership approach that includes, for example, training courses and events with our suppliers. We are also currently preparing to implement a leading cloud-based tool to automate and optimize our due diligence processes and to enable continuous documentation in the supply chain beyond human rights topics.

Customers, shareholders, employees, non-governmental organizations,\nrating agencies and also the general public could lose trust in our company. In itself, the examination and\nclarification of alleged cases can result in considerable internal and external costs.\nCompliance risks can occur in every area of the company. The compliance organization therefore aims to ensure\nproper and compliant modes of conduct and behavior on the part of a company and its employees and to make\nsure that potential or actual infringements of external or internal regulations are responded to appropriately.\nGroup-wide structures, stringent regulations and standardized processes are put in place as far as possible to\nprevent any liability risks, risks of a penalty or a fine and reputation risks, in addition to other financial\ndisadvantages, loss or damage that the company may incur as a result of misconduct or violations of the law.\nThe regular execution of a Group-wide compliance risk assessment (top-down and bottom-up) and additional\nregular and case-by-case risk analyses help to identify systemic and company-specific compliance risks. Measures\nto introduce or improve international or local structures, guidelines, processes, IT systems and training content\nare derived from the results.\nHowever, despite extensive and multi-level inspection and control mechanisms, the possibility of risks arising\nfrom unlawful activities of individual parties cannot be ruled out. Alleged cases are investigated actively. In\ninvestigative proceedings we cooperate with the relevant authorities. Proven misconduct results in consequences\nfor those involved and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 to adjustments in the organization. However, the financial impact of\ncompliance cases on the Group\u2019s results is very difficult to estimate. Depending on the case and the\ncircumstances, a considerable range is to be assumed.\nThe introduction in 2018 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) required EU-based companies also\nto meet a whole range of obligations concerning data protection. Violations of the GDPR are subject to significant\nsanctions, including the imposition of fines totaling up to 4% of the Group\u2019s total global sales. To counter these\nrisks, we established a Group-wide data security management system (DSMS) to ensure a data protection level\nthat is structured, secure and, as far as possible, standardized. It defines a range of functions and responsibilities\nand undergoes continuous improvement as part of a \u201cplan\u2013do\u2013check\u2013act\u201d cycle. The effectiveness of the DSMS\nis monitored on an ongoing basis. Where legally prescribed, data protection officers are appointed in Rheinmetall.\nOur employees receive regular instruction and training in matters relating to data protection. The content of data\nprotection training is adapted for individual departments in line with the specific requirements in their respective\nspheres of work. For new employees, this training is an important part of the induction process.\nPublic perception\nIn a time in which markets are interconnected and the flow of information is becoming increasingly globalized,\ncommunication is becoming ever more important to the company\u2019s success. Shareholders, customers, lenders,\nemployees, the media and the public at large are informed regularly, transparently and quickly about our social\nand financial status, our key processes and changes as well as the latest news and developments.\nIn the course of a highly dynamic sustainability debate, the communicative presentation of a medium- and long-\nterm corporate strategy based on responsible action is crucial for the perception and acceptance of the company\nby a broad public. Protecting and building a positive reputation as a central task of communications is considered\nessential in order to continue to be recognized and commissioned as a supplier and equipment provider to the\npublic sector and to be able to survive on the money, credit and capital markets. In particular, the impact of our\ncommunications and other image-building measures on the general (media) public determines how we are\nperceived by politicians, administrators, and business and financial players.\nEnvironmental, social, governance\nSustainability risks differ in part from traditional risk assessments in terms of the timescale considered, the\nassessment of their impact, but also in perspective. For this reason, the process for sustainability risk reporting\nbuilds on the existing risk management modules, but goes beyond them in parts. This avoids both duplication of\nwork and double entries while also ensuring comprehensive analysis.\nRHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 93 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nRisks and opportunities\nSignificant corporate risks\nIf we do not comply with the increasing regulatory requirements and fail to meet the expectations and\nrequirements of governments, customers, investors, lenders and other financial institutions in the areas of\nenvironmental and social responsibility and governance (ESG) to the required extent or level of detail, this can\nhave a negative impact on the Rheinmetall Group\u2019s business and earnings. Customers could potentially refuse to\naward contracts to us, private and institutional investors might refuse to include us in their portfolio, and financial\ninstitutes might refuse to issue loans at all or only at an increased cost. We counter these risks through\ncomprehensive and transparent CSR/ESG reporting based on globally recognized standards such as the Global\nReporting Initiative and \u2013 where possible \u2013 through continuous improvement of our customer and CSR/ESG ratings\nfrom internationally renowned agencies and institutions (e.g. MSCI, ISS ESG, Sustainalytics, VigeoEiris,\nArabesque, Gaia and CDP).\nFurthermore, the passing of legislation or regulations for the finance sector could cause institutional investors to\nrestructure their portfolios and reduce or terminate their exposures in companies that operate in industries\nclassed as critical. Possible sector exclusions (e.g. for the weapons and defence industry) could also limit our\noptions to raise capital. Changes to the qualification criteria for being accepted to or remaining on stock indices\ncould also harbor risks for our company.\n\nWe have consistently demonstrated our responsibility toward our employees and products and toward the\nenvironment and society for over 130 years. Founded in 1889, our technology company - rooted regionally and\nglobally positioned - with its companies is integrated into the general political, regulatory, economic, ecological\nand social conditions of various countries and geographical regions. We are committed to fair competition and to\nlawful business conduct that not only shows integrity but is also social and ethical. Sustainable management has\nalways been an integral component of our business and production processes and helps to secure the long-term\nfuture of our company. In addition to continuity, economic growth and compliance with the fundamental principles\nof good corporate governance, the careful use of natural resources is part of our self-image \u2013 to the benefit of our\nshareholders, our employees, for our locations and for the society in which we have a fixed place as corporate\ncitizen.\nGlobally, European and German understanding on key areas, topics and aspects in the Environment, Social and\nGovernance (ESG) categories may not be equally assessed, weighted and prioritized. Even so, over the past few\nyears \u2013 at the United Nation\u2019s behest and in line with the objectives of the European Union \u2013 many countries,\nincluding Germany, have expanded their requirements for companies to take responsibility for upholding\nrecognized human rights, labor, social, environmental and anti-corruption standards, both within and outside the\nbounds of the company. This relates to the impact of business activities on sustainable development in the world\nencompassing the entire value-added chain. But customers, shareholders, investors, non-governmental\norganizations and \u2013 not least \u2013 the company\u2019s own employees are also interested in getting a full picture of the\ncompany, its global business activities and their impact on people, the climate, and the environment. Inquiries\nfrom all sections of society are thereby increasing, as are expectations for transparency, scope, level of detail,\ninformative value and comparability of company data on the very complex issue of sustainability.\nBusiness model\nOur world is changing rapidly in every respect \u2013 technologically, economically, politically and culturally. We lead\nlives that are more global, more connected, more digital than ever before and are constantly faced with new\nchallenges that have to be overcome.\nAs a supplier to the automobile industry, the civilian area makes a contribution that people the world over reach\ntheir destinations in a more environmentally friendly manner. In addition to the ongoing development of products\nfor conventional drives, Rheinmetall is focusing on the development of systems for vehicles powered by hybrids,\nbatteries, and fuel cells. We shape the mobility of the future with solutions for reduced emissions and electric\ndrive systems. Outside the traditional automotive sector, we are continuing to pursue our diversification strategy\nin the industrial sector.\nHydrogen is considered a key element in the transition to a climate-neutral energy supply of the future. We are\naddressing mobile and stationary hydrogen technology applications. The spectrum extends from power\ngeneration derived from renewable energies across hydrogen production to its storage and distribution right up to\nits use.\nWe are a reliable partner for German and international armed and security forces. With its product and capability\nspectrum, Rheinmetall is a leading European systems supplier offering innovative, state-of-the-art and threat-\nappropriate security technology for military and civilian applications alike. We protect those who protect us all \u2013\nagainst current and future threats.\nThe Rheinmetall Group\u2019s business model is described in detail under the Basic information on the Rheinmetall\nGroup\u201d section.\n112 RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nGovernance\nGovernance\nThis non-financial statement of the Group, which includes all continuing and discontinued business activities,\nwas prepared in line with the requirements of Sections 315b, 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB.\nPursuant to section 315b(1) sentence 3 HGB, reference is made to the non-financial disclosures included in another\npart of the Group management report for more detailed information on individual aspects. We use the standards\nof the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as a reporting basis when preparing the non-financial statement. In this way\nwe want to ensure transparency and comparability. The fiscal year is the reporting period for the non-financial\nstatement of the Group, and there is an annual reporting cycle.\nSustainability organization\nAt Rheinmetall the responsibility for sustainability lies with the Executive Board as a whole. The central area\nCorporate Social Responsibility reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In consultation with the\nresponsible central department managed by the Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, the Executive Board sets\nthe strategic framework for sustainability activities. In cooperation with the divisional and local sustainability\nofficers and the Executive Board, the Corporate Social Responsibility department bundles and coordinates the\nrespective ESG requirements. From this, it develops the sustainability strategy aligned to the Group strategy and\nderives the resulting fields of action, measures, targets and indicators.\nIn addition to the members of the Executive Board, the Corporate Sustainability Board established in October 2021\nincludes the divisional heads, the Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, the heads of Controlling, Compliance,\nStrategy, Purchasing, Human Resources, Corporate Communications, the Head of Investor Relations and the two\nChief Technology Officers. The Corporate Sustainability Board deals with current regulatory developments and\ntrends in the ESG area, as well as with the challenges they pose for Rheinmetall. The members of the board help\nto ensure that the interests of our stakeholders are given special consideration. At the annual meeting in\nDecember 2022, the heads of the five divisions, among others, presented the progress made in the area of ESG\nduring the year and provided an outlook on the measures planned for 2023.\nSustainability also includes a material strategic component. As an interdisciplinary and cross-division topic, ESG\nis a fixed element of the activity of the Supervisory Board. For example, the members of the Supervisory Board\ndeal with current ESG developments, with their importance for the corporation and its stakeholders and the\nresulting future challenges and opportunities. The Audit Committee handles not only risk management, but also\nthe scope and depth of current and future regulatory requirements for sustainability reporting and their\nimplementation, as well as the processes and internal controls implemented in collecting the data required for\nreporting. The Strategy and ESG Committee deals with the strategic further development of sustainability and its\nenshrinement in the overall strategy of the company. It obtains information on the associated ESG fields of action,\nmeasures and initiatives, as well as on the progress made, and monitors the inclusion of sustainability aspects in\nthe business model. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Personnel Committee deals with the implementation of ESG\nobjectives in internal performance indicators and their consideration in remuneration systems. As part of the\nExecutive Board\u2019s remuneration, it defines the ESG criteria, their target values and target achievement ranges on\nan annual basis and assesses the respective degree of achievement of the non-financial targets.\nSustainability management\nContinuous improvement and ongoing further development aligned to the changing requirements of our time are\nthe basis for sustainability activities at Rheinmetall. Since the Corporate Social Responsibility department was\nestablished in 2011, we have been working on an ongoing basis in improving the cooperation with the experts in\nthe divisions, business units and national companies.\nVarious principles and international guidelines form the basis for our sustainability management:\n(cid:131)(cid:3) Corporate philosophy with vision and mission based on the values of respect, trust and openness;\n(cid:131)(cid:3) Code of Conduct for all employees with binding regulations which include topics such as human rights,\nanti-corruption, compliance, adherence to competition and anti-trust legislation;\nRHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 113 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nGovernance\n\nFor senior and middle management, the achievement of ESG targets will be taken into account at 20% in the short\nterm and long term incentive from fiscal 2023.\nReporting\nIn the context of its reporting on non-financial and sustainability-related performance, Rheinmetall aligns itself to\nthe international standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).\nSince October 2011, we have been reporting on our sustainability activities on our website under the heading\n\u201cResponsibility.\u201d\nSince fiscal 2017, we have been submitting a non-financial statement every year.\nIn addition to the legal requirements, we publish the ESG Factbook reporting annually. On more than 100 pages,\nwe provide information in the Performance, People, Planet and Governance categories on topics defined as\nmaterial and present our economic, social and ecological performance over a period of three years. In addition,\nthe Factbook includes the GRI Content Index. An additional index refers to the covered reporting requirements of\nthe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) in the sectors relevant to our business model.\nAfter signing the UN Global Compact in fiscal 2021 as a visible expression of our commitment to sustainability, we\npublished the annual Communication on Progress (CoP) on the new UNGC platform via the Early Adopter Program\nin August 2022. With this report we show transparently what progress the company has made in the area of\ncorporate responsibility over a year.\nWe are continuously developing our indicator system in accordance with internationally recognized standards and\non the basis of internal and external requirements so that, in addition to internal management, our external\nreporting can be aligned even more specifically to the demands of groups such as investors and to make our\nsustainability performance \u2013 as well as the challenges and opportunities of long-term company development \u2013\nmore transparent.\nMateriality analysis\nIn view of the emerging new strong trends in the area of sustainability and the soon-to-be-introduced extensions\nand new requirements in sustainability reporting, we again carried out a materiality analysis in the past fiscal year,\ninvolving both internal and external stakeholders. The list of potentially relevant sustainability aspects has been\nreviewed for up-to-dateness and adjusted accordingly. For this purpose, the results of secondary analyses have\nbeen taken into account, including the evaluation of regulatory requirements and projects, ESG ratings,\nbenchmarks of our peer group and media reporting. The result of the materiality analysis reflects the economic,\nenvironmental and social sustainability issues that are significant for our company. The focus of our reporting is\non the topics classified as very material and material. For some other aspects, our voluntary reporting in this non-\n114 RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nEmployees\nFurther training for employees \u2013 Further training, assuming responsibility and promotion opportunities have a\nhigh degree of relevance for the commitment and satisfaction of our employees. To ensure the continued growth\nand future viability of the Rheinmetall Group, in consideration of additional demographic factors and the shortage\nof specialist staff that is expected in many places, the development of employees, talented management trainees\nand experienced specialist and managerial staff in line with current and future requirements constitutes a key\nfactor for the company\u2019s success. Thus strategic personnel planning is aligned to securing and continuously\nraising the high skill levels to ensure that the Group companies can achieve their business goals.\nAnnual appraisal interviews between management and employees are deployed to talk about performance,\ntargets and individual development options. A range of training opportunities are in place to support Rheinmetall\nemployees with planning their own development, achieving individual learning objectives and expanding their\nskills to meet the requirements of their current positions or to obtain new positions. Personnel development and\ntraining activities are offered on the basis of regular needs assessments. Various sources are used for needs\nassessment. These include not only the results of the potential assessment and personnel development\nappraisals, which are conducted in accordance with the collective agreement on training, but also Group-wide\nsuccessor planning, the target-setting process and capacity and investment planning. Further training objectives\nare also derived from strategic objectives, such as the increased internationalization of the Group and the\ntransformation of the previous automotive supply business.\nEstablished development programs for managerial and junior staff \u2013 Top performers and employees with\npotential are identified as part of systematic assessments and their skills are selectively developed. This is based\non the Rheinmetall \u201cManagement by Objectives\u201d program, which incorporates the relevant leadership and\nmanagement skills in five key areas. The performance and development potential of managers and prospective\nmanagement candidates is identified, assessed and evaluated at regular intervals as part of a consistent,\nmultistage selection and assessment process. This personal stocktaking enables an open discussion on strengths\nand weaknesses and structured feedback on individual development and promotion opportunities.\nIndividually determined personnel development plans help to improve the candidates\u2019 business, technical,\nmethodical and social skills. Furthermore, prospective managers can take part in management potential analyses\nand/or individual assessments, which analyze their abilities and skills profiles in more depth.\nThe Rheinmetall Academy successively prepares these employees at various stages in their careers for assuming\nleadership or specialist roles. The modular course programs and content are systematically designed around the\ntopics of strategy, management, leadership, methodical competence, project management and\ninternationalization. The Executive Development Program and Manager\u2019s Leadership Program focus on \u201cLeading\nmy business\u201d and help experienced managers to perform their organizational and managerial duties successfully.\nIn particular, they help managers to build on their knowledge of corporate controlling, employee leadership and\nchange management. Junior staff are prepared to take on their first managerial challenges in the Young Manager\nProgram. The content of the Project Manager\u2019s Program is tailored to the tasks and activities performed by\nemployees of the Rheinmetall Group. These supplement the technical and methodical project management skills\nacquired in certification courses with training on \u201cHow to manage project teams.\u201d\nIn the year under review, 2,438 employees (1,883 men, 555 women) attended 199 (previous year: 221) one-day or\nmulti-day events at the Rheinmetall Academy, compared with 2,732 (2,061 men, 671 women) in the previous year.\n59% of participants come from the Vehicle Systems, Weapon and Ammunition and Electronic Solutions divisions,\n27% from companies of the Sensors and Actuators and Materials and Trade divisions. The share of female\nparticipants was around 23%. Around two-thirds of participants completed an online training session, while\naround one-third attended a classroom seminar.\nModern remuneration systems\nAppropriate, fair and standard market pay systems are a key aspect in recruiting and retaining dedicated staff at\nthe company. Rheinmetall offers attractive contractual terms. In addition to the category of work, these are based\non the content of the role and the amount of responsibility and are linked to market rates. In addition to fixed\nremuneration components in line with market requirements, performance-related bonuses and variable salary\ncomponents are also paid.\nRHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 123 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nEmployees\nThe \u201cManagement by Objectives\u201d concept is linked to variable salary components for managers and employees\nnot covered by collective wage agreements. An individual variable portion of income is paid in accordance with\nthe achievement of individually agreed targets and depending on the company\u2019s performance. Depending on the\nextent to which targets are achieved, this amounts to between 0% and 200% of variable target income. The fact\nthat these income components are based on targets provides incentives for employees to act independently and\nto take on challenges. Division heads, managers and executives receive a long-term incentive (LTI) in addition to\nthis short-term component. This is geared towards long-term corporate success and for 2022 includes payment of\n40% of the long-term incentive amount in Rheinmetall shares, which are subject to a four-year lock-up period. The\nnumber of shares granted is based on a reference share price, which corresponds to the average price on the last\nfive trading days in February of the subsequent fiscal year. A total of 60% of the long-term incentive amount is\npaid in cash and is also used for the immediate payment of tax on Rheinmetall shares. To bring the interests and\ntargets of management and stakeholders into alignment, non-financial targets have been taken into account in\nExecutive Board remuneration since 2020. For senior and middle management, the achievement of ESG targets\nwill be taken into account at 20% in the short term and long term incentive from fiscal 2023.\nThe company\u2019s success benefits employees, including staff covered by collective wage agreements in Germany,\nin two ways: First, employees receive an annual share of profits subject to the annual performance of the\nRheinmetall Group; second, the increase in the value of the company achieved is paid out in a success-oriented\ncomponent in the company pension, thus leading to improved support in old age.\nEmployee subscription to Rheinmetall shares\nIn the year under review, Rheinmetall AG again launched a share-based employee participation program in 29\nGerman (previous year: 27) and eight Group companies in Austria and Switzerland, which provides for an\nindividual monthly savings plan in a basic or extended version. The 30% employer allowance, which amounted to\n\u20ac3 million as in the previous year, enables employees to acquire shares at attractive conditions subject to a two-\nyear holding period and participate as part-owners in the business success of their company.\nEmployee share programme\n2022 2021\nShares acquired 66,905 105,118\nParticipating companies 37 27\nEligible employees 14,646 12,551\nParticipating employees 3,968 3,321\nParticipation rate 27 26\nDiversity\nIn times of accelerating change in technology, business and society, ensuring equal opportunities and promoting\ndiversity is an important task for HR at Rheinmetall. For us diversity is a key value, and in times of transformation\na major factor for innovation and steady growth. We value all people regardless of gender, age, sexual identity,\neducational background, state of health, ethical or social background, skin color, religion, culture, ideology or\nother personal characteristics. For us it is important to create a secure and integrative working environment, one\nmarked by respect, in which each person is equal, treated fairly and can maximize his or her potential.\nThe corporate philosophy, the Code of Conduct, the principles of social responsibility and the Diversity Policy\nestablish the framework for promoting diversity and equal opportunity as well as acting against discrimination. By\nsigning the Diversity Charter, we are underlining this stance and making it clear to the public as well.\nTo mark International Diversity Day at the end of May 2022, teams at national and international locations were\ninvited to take part in a Group-wide photo competition to show how diversity is put into practice in their day-to-\nday work. The accompanying online program also offered training units on unconscious bias and enabled an\ninteractive exchange with the Head of HR. In year under review, preparations were also made to expand the range\nof advice and support services offered by the established ViVa Family and Care Service at the German locations to\ninclude the Diversity Advice module from January 2023.\n124 RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nProcurement and the supply chain\n\nWe also wish to anchor our values and principles in our supply chains and therefore expect our business partners\nto share our principles regarding responsible and fair conduct to employees, customers, suppliers and the public\nand demonstrate this responsibility accordingly. We expect our suppliers to take into account the principles laid\ndown in our Supplier Code of Conduct \u2013 which is available in several languages and is valid worldwide \u2013 in their\nown corporate policies and to view them as an advantageous basis for further business relationships.\nIn the year under review, the Supplier Code of Conduct as a binding component of contracts with suppliers was\ncompletely revised in consultation with various departments, and the content was adapted to meet the\nrequirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Based on the new set of rules, Rheinmetall can now\nact more proactively in partnership with its supplier partners to improve sustainability and compliance aspects in\nthe procurement process and to achieve corporate development goals at the economic, social, ecological and\nregulatory levels.\nSupply chains in the automotive industry\nThe automotive industry consists of a complex network of globally active players. A distinction is made between\noriginal equipment manufacturers (OEMs), first-tier suppliers and second- and third-tier suppliers. Manufacturers\nand suppliers are closely linked in working together to develop and produce vehicles. Automotive manufacturers\nhave been working for some time on anchoring economic, ecological and social objectives vertically, i.e. across\nall stages of the value-added chain. These include respect of international ESG standards, reduction of carbon\nfootprint in production, a higher proportion of recyclable material, responsible use of substances and materials,\nand future CO -neutral products.\n\n\nCompliance\nat regular intervals, so that the OEMs can analyze and assess the services and progress in terms of ESG criteria\nand determine the degree to which their requirements have been met. OEMs also carry out in-depth on-site checks\nas part of their supply chain relationship management and audit suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities based on\nsustainability criteria from the areas of environment, social responsibility and integrity. This includes the review\nof documents, talks with employees and a site visit.\nSupply chains in the security and defence industry\nSupply chains in the defence industry are characterized by very complex structures, easily comprising up to eight\nstages for the needs of, for example, Rheinmetall Waffe Munition and Rheinmetall Landsysteme. The high\nproportion of specific materials and processes combined with a broad product range leads, as is generally the\ncase in this industry, to a high proportion of single sourcing, also because only a few companies throughout the\nworld completely manufacture or command the very specific products and processes. In the defence technology\nindustry, switching to new suppliers is very costly, both from a financial and time-related perspective. The\nqualification of products carried out by military authorities is linked not only to the performance of the product\nitself but also to the manufacturing process, manufacturing location and suppliers. A change of suppliers therefore\nautomatically results in costs for requalification. The procurement business in the area of ballistic protection has\nthe characteristics of a project, i.e. it is characterized by intermittent production by our suppliers. This requires a\nhigh number of quality assurance measures. Furthermore, specific legislation, such as the War Weapons Control\nAct, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), to cite just a few,\nmust be taken into consideration for procurement in the divisions operating in the security technology sector.\nRisks\nInformation on reducing or avoiding procurement risks can be found in the \u201cRisks and opportunities\u201d section.\nCompliance\nManagement approach\nThe reputation of Rheinmetall, the success of the business and the trust of customers, investors, employees and\nthe general public depend not only on the quality of our products and services, but also to a large degree on good\ncorporate governance and, in particular, on effective compliance processes. In line with our values and our Code\nof Conduct, we are committed to conduct characterized by responsibility, integrity, respect and fairness. We are\nan honest, loyal and reliable partner for all our stakeholders.\nOur binding compliance policy serves to safeguard our business success on a lasting basis. The members of the\nExecutive Board and managers, executives and employees naturally have an obligation to comply at all times in\ntheir working environment with all the applicable country-specific laws, external and internal regulations and other\nprovisions, to conduct themselves correctly in business dealings, to preserve the company\u2019s tangible and\nintangible assets and to avoid anything that may result in operational or financial disadvantages or damage to the\nimage of individual companies or the Rheinmetall Group. We do not tolerate any damage to our company\u2019s\nstanding and to the reputation of our employees or agents as a result of unlawful and/or unethical behavior or\ncorrupt business practices.\nInternational business activities\nIn the day-to-day business of an international company, the different national political and legal systems as well\nas values, customs and societal norms of different cultural groups have to be taken into account. In addition to\nthe applicable legislation of the countries of exportation, European Union regulations as well as anti-corruption\nlaws such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and the French Sapin II Anti-Corruption Act\nmust be observed. The requirements that Rheinmetall Group companies have to fulfill are therefore many and\nvaried. With deliveries made to many countries around the globe in 2022, management and employees now more\nthan ever need guidance when it comes to national and international business and in relations with business\npartners, office holders, authorities and other state bodies in order to avoid potential errors and any resulting\nreputational, business or liability risks.\nCompliance organization\nRHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 131 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nCompliance\nIllegal conduct can cause many different types of damage and can have serious consequences, such as the\ndiscontinuation of business relationships, exclusion from orders, negative assessments on capital markets,\nimposition of fines, absorption of profits, claims for damages as well as civil or criminal proceedings. There is also\nthe risk of significant and lasting damage to the Group\u2019s reputation and thus a detrimental effect on its market\nposition. Compliance at Rheinmetall is therefore taken very seriously and has for a long time been an integral part\nof the corporate culture.\nTo provide its employees with guidance and allow them to conduct business with confidence, Rheinmetall took a\nholistic approach and set up a compliance organization very early on providing standardized general conditions\nand clear guidelines for legal and rule-compliant, ethically correct and fair conduct in day-to-day business.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board, is responsible for\nCorporate Compliance and Group Data Protection at holding company level. Corporate Compliance is divided into\nCompliance Program with the functions Prevention, Regulation and Business Partners, and Compliance\nOperations with the functions Investigation and Programs & Acquisitions. As an independent organizational unit,\nData Protection is divided into two functional areas. The focus in the Data Protection organization is on consulting,\nprocess design, project management and case handling in all data privacy matters. The internal Rheinmetall Group\nData Protection Officer is responsible for monitoring compliance with statutory data protection requirements\nthroughout the Group. In this function, there is a reporting line to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer is also responsible for the organization compliance field, comprising the five\ndivisional compliance teams, the Regional Compliance Officers abroad and the central holding support, as part of\nthe strongly normative management. The function of Corporate Compliance Officer for Central Europe was also\nnewly established in Corporate Compliance to support the increasingly important locations and major projects in\nEastern Europe (with a focus on Hungary).\nThe Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee on a\nregular basis, by attending meetings, on the status and effectiveness of the compliance management system and\non the latest developments. In serious cases, the committees are informed immediately. In addition, the heads of\nthe divisions are also kept apprised monthly by Corporate Compliance or the Division Compliance Officer of current\ndevelopments, new rules, planned training measures or possible compliance infringements as well as the status\nof possible investigations.\nCompliance management system\nCompliance is taken into account as an aspect of risk in decision-making processes, not only when it comes to\nconsiderations regarding the strategic and operational alignment of the Rheinmetall Group, but also in day-to-day\nbusiness. The central compliance management system, with its integrated and dynamic focus on constantly\nupdated key risk aspects, such as corruption, data protection violations or attempted fraud, is firmly anchored in\nthe Group-wide management and control structures and includes all instruments, processes and extensive\nmeasures intended to ensure that procedures in the companies of the Rheinmetall Group comply with the\napplicable country-specific legislation, general legal conditions, regulatory provisions and the company\u2019s own\nregulations. It also creates an organizational structure that allows the applicable standards to be publicized across\nthe divisions and their implementation status to be tracked. If binding legal regulations in individual countries\ndeviate from the rules set out in the compliance management system, the stricter regulation shall apply where\npermissible. In the case of changes to the content, the Chief Compliance Officer\u2019s approval is also required.\nThe compliance management system is updated at regular intervals, not only in line with the applicable legal\nrequirements but also in the light of new findings from reporting, comparisons with other compliance systems and\nthe assessment of external specialists (benchmarking). It is also reviewed on an ad-hoc basis if any breach of\ncompliance regulations is suspected or discovered.\nImplementation of the compliance management system is monitored by regular reports to Corporate Compliance\nand by routine and special audits conducted by internal auditing and the compliance organization.\nCompliance officers also monitor important transactions in the companies, such as mergers and acquisitions, the\nestablishment of joint ventures, pre-employment checks and the integration of sales brokers or integrity and\n132 RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nCompliance\nsustainability risk assessments for the supply chains, thereby supporting the respective departments in their\nwork. In addition, compliance officers advise the people responsible in the operational units on how to take\ncompliance into account in operational business processes.\nIn the area of sales support, there is a platform containing compliance-relevant information on around 160\ncountries and regions. Moreover, the tender process in the security and defence technology divisions is structured\nto the effect that in the course of the bid/no bid decision a compliance audit using defined criteria is obligatory\nfor projects over a certain value threshold. Various IT tools are also used in all divisions to support compliance\nprocesses.\nCorporate compliance\nCompliance Program | Prevention \u2013 A compliance risk prevention guideline was implemented in 2019 with the aim\nof ensuring a standardized procedure for systematic risk prevention and creating the structural and organizational\npreconditions required for this at all levels in the company. Procedures for taking an initial inventory of compliance\nrisks, deriving response measures and plan regular repeat measures are defined for different applications.\nTo help continuously identify compliance risks and to develop and improve mitigation measures, the Prevention\nteam was established, which focuses on structural prevention topics on an ongoing or project basis. In addition\nto the web-based training courses available in the Empower Learn HR system for the companies in Germany,\nAustria and Switzerland (D-A-CH) relating to the categories of Code of Conduct, anti-corruption, anti-trust law and\ndata protection, Prevention uses the TRACE learning management system for companies outside the D-A-CH\nregion, offering around 20 training modules in various languages. The roll-out of the regulatory compliance project\nlaunched in 2020, which is intended to expand the \u201cligation-proof organization,\u201d was driven forward in the fiscal\nyear. Here, around 29 function-specific regulatory areas to be observed globally (e.g. occupational safety,\nenvironmental protection, export, customs and logistics regulations, and anti-money-laundering standards) were\nidentified centrally and compared against correlating corporate policies. Next, an IT tool is to be introduced to\nenable the employees concerned in over 30 countries \u2013 those who have increased contact with regulatory areas\nsubject to liability in their everyday and project business \u2013 to deal with the complex regulations more easily and\nreliably.\nThe goal of making the processes, projects and tasks enshrined in the compliance management system more\nmeasurable and transparent was achieved in the year under review by implementing a new reporting tool. More\nthan 110 employees entrusted with a compliance function in around 130 units of the company make use of the\nmany opportunities to track, assess and manage the status of a large number of compliance-relevant processes\nand projects at various organizational levels of the Rheinmetall Group. These include reporting on the status quo\nof training courses, audits, risk analyses, consulting focal points, processes, compliance levels for guideline roll-\nouts, and the recording of project statuses. The associated evaluation options will enable compliance reporting to\nthe Executive Board and Supervisory Board to focus on KPIs in the future.\nIn February 2022, the roll-out of the new guideline on identifying and avoiding conflicts of interest in the\nRheinmetall Group began. This guideline introduces regulations for the recognition, documentation, escalation\nand handling of conflicts of interest on a binding basis.\nCompliance Program | Regulation \u2013 Taking account of or on the basis of external conditions such as laws,\nregulations, etc. and internal organizational requirements, the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG issues\nregulations for the Rheinmetall Group so that all employees concerned act in line with standardized processes.\nRegulation Management, which is based in the central Corporate Compliance department, provides support with\nthe preparation and management of conduct- and process-related regulations of Rheinmetall AG for the\nRheinmetall Group. To ensure a standardized procedure, the Regulation Management Manual 2.0 has been\navailable since October 2020. This manual is aimed primarily at publishers and authors as well as members of the\nExecutive Board and management bodies, but also includes several interfaces at all organizational levels.\nIn the Central Regulations Register on the Group\u2019s intranet, all regulations approved by the Executive Board can\nbe called up at any time. These are provided in German and English in line with the corporate languages.\nRHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 133 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nCompliance\nCompliance Program | Business Partners \u2013 As a shared service center, the central Compliance Due Diligence\ncenter of expertise conducts not only pre-employment checks on applicants for key positions, but also all\ncompliance due diligence checks on new and existing business partners (e.g. procurement, cooperation and sales\npartners) on a Group-wide basis. The focus lies here on determining whether the commitment is legally\npermissible, whether all attributable people can be identified (\u201cknow your customer \u2013 KYC\u201d and \u201cknow your\nsupplier \u2013 KYS\u201d) and whether conflicts of interest are excluded. The general performance and integrity of the\nbusiness partner are also assessed. The local compliance organization will continue concentrating on assessing\nthe transaction-specific compliance risk associated with the commitment of a business partner at company level.\nThe center of expertise will be integrated in day-to-day operational business through various technical and\nprocedural interfaces. There is already a relatively high degree of digitalization in the Compliance Due Diligence\norganization. In addition to a specific management database for selecting, managing and monitoring cooperation\nand sales partners, the whole integrity due diligence process can now be performed via a secure online platform\nas well. As part of two special projects, the data of more than 8,000 business partners was migrated to the\nelectronic third-party management system. The first step involved individual risk assessments. In the second step,\n24/7 active, systematic monitoring of adverse media information and daily updated entries on sanctions lists was\nactivated.\nIn the past fiscal year, apart from the business partners screened by the automated procedure, around 900\nbusiness partners and people who applied for key positions at the Rheinmetall Group were subjected to non-\nautomated screening in procedures of varying complexity depending on the risk.\nThe Rheinmetall Risk Indicator (RRI) developed in the previous year went live in the year under review. It is intended\nto serve as the basis for various internal risk calculations and replace the previously used TI Corruption Perception\nIndex. The RRI is made up of various informative governance, compliance and ESG indices. These are included in\nthe arithmetic with different weightings and thus reflect the risk priorities set by the Rheinmetall Group.\nCompliance Operations | Investigation \u2013 If employees have information on questionable activities that have been\nobserved, specific breaches of regulations or business practices that may be prohibited, they can contact not only\ntheir line manager but also \u2013 and in full confidence \u2013 various internal offices as well as an independent, external\nombudsman (lawyer) and so avert losses for the company.\nIncident management is also supported by the electronic whistleblower platform \u201cIntegrity Line,\u201d which has been\nimplemented throughout the Group. In addition, employees can contact the compliance organization directly if\nthey suspect or know of breaches of regulations or business practices. In addition to employees, external parties\ncan also contact the ombudsman by telephone or e-mail, send an e-mail to speakup@rheinmetall.com or contact\na specialist compliance officer by telephone.\nProtection is guaranteed for all whistleblowers; who need not fear any disadvantages as a result of providing\ninformation. Employees involved in investigations into possible breaches of compliance will be assumed to be\ninnocent until proven otherwise. Any information that is received will be systematically analyzed.\nAn incident management guideline on how to deal with suspected cases and on the standardized processing of\ncompliance cases aims to ensure that the handling of information is also independent, transparent and fair as\nwell as being subject to high standards that are comparable across the Group. It also offers legal certainty when\ncarrying out investigations, meaning that appropriate account can be taken of the interests of employees and the\nemployer.\nSystematic follow-up checks are performed on the basis of this incident management guideline and appropriate\nmeasures are taken to properly clarify the facts that have been reported, if necessary with the involvement of\nexternal specialists. Confidentiality and discretion take top priority here. If necessary, we will involve the relevant\nauthorities and cooperate with them to resolve the matter. Proven misconduct is sanctioned and entails\norganizational measures and, for the employees who committed the offense(s), consequences under labor law,\ncivil law and criminal law. The 23 Incident Response Committees established to conduct rapid, interdisciplinary\ninitial evaluations of reports help to ensure that suspected cases can be identified and clarified without delay.\n134 RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nCompliance\n\nTo improve the internationalization of data protection in the Group, in 2022 contacts were identified in the relevant\nGroup companies around the world who will be available in the future as contact and coordination points for the\nimplementation of data protection requirements. The first intensive data protection training courses have already\nbeen held to assist them, and these will be continued in fiscal 2023.\nTraining and advice\nTo make employees at all levels of the company aware of compliance risks, numerous introduction events, training\nseminars and workshops are held, some of which are tailored to specific functions such as management, buyers\nor sales staff. Legislation and important regulations are explained and further content is provided at these\nsessions. Attention is also drawn to internal compliance requirements, risks and possible sanctions and, based\nRHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 135 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nSocial responsibility\non case studies, practical advice is given on correct conduct in specific situations during everyday work. These\nclassroom training sessions, which also serve as a practical forum for discussions, are accompanied by interactive\nonline programs. Each year, as part of compliance awareness training, employees at sites in Germany and abroad\nnot only receive training in general compliance topics but also in the prevention of corruption, conflicts of interest,\nmoney laundering and CEO fraud, export control and anti-trust and competition law. The compliance training\nmatrix, which forms part of the procedural instructions for compliance training, provides an overview of the training\ncontent geared toward the different target groups and management levels. Its content is adjusted in accordance\nwith the needs of the participants or supplemented with country-specific or regional peculiarities. In the past fiscal\nyear, employees took part in around 6,000 classroom training sessions on various compliance topics. In addition,\naround 6,300 compliance-relevant e-learning modules were completed in the year under review.\nOur employees receive regular instruction and training in matters relating to data protection. Around 2,000 people\ntook part in e-learning courses in the year under review. The content of data protection training is adapted for\nindividual departments in line with the specific requirements in their spheres of work. For new employees, general\ndata protection training is part of the onboarding process. A new e-learning module was also chosen in the past\nfiscal year which is available in numerous languages and will be rolled out in fiscal 2023. In addition, all levels of\nthe company are provided with data protection advice on an ad hoc basis.\nRisks\nInformation on reducing or avoiding compliance risks is provided in the \u201cRisks and opportunities\u201d section\nSocial responsibility\nManagement approach\nSocial acceptance is an important requirement for companies\u2019 economic success. Many Rheinmetall companies\ncan look back on a long history. They have been connected with their sites for many years and are strongly rooted\nin the local community \u2013 after all, this is where their employees and business partners live. In some cases, major\ncustomers are based there. Rheinmetall is a living, breathing part of society and participates actively in it and not\njust in a financial sense. We get involved in the areas of education, sport and culture and also provide direct\nsupport for local social projects and charitable organizations. By adding value locally, we also contribute to\nregional development. Flourishing production sites do not only mean attractive, highly skilled jobs and training\nplaces close to home but also orders for local suppliers and service providers. In addition, a large part of the sales\ngenerated by the companies returns to the respective economies via the employees, public sector and the\nshareholders. Capital expenditure in future growth is financed via the funds remaining in the Rheinmetall Group.\nWe also make major contributions to society as an employer and client as well as with our products and the\ntransfer of knowledge.\nCorporate citizenship\nCorporate citizenship is part of corporate social responsibility and refers to citizenship in and of companies that\npursue a medium- and long-term business strategy on the basis of responsible action and, in addition to their\nactual business operations, are also actively involved in local civil society and/or for social/charitable,\nenvironmental, sporting and cultural causes as \u201cgood citizens.\u201d Social engagement is a long-standing tradition at\nRheinmetall. It always goes beyond the plant boundaries. Since the needs and opportunities in the vicinity of the\nlocations where we operate vary greatly, the decision on which local project to support is incumbent on the\nrespective management teams of the companies, the division heads or the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG.\nAs an expression of our social commitment and in solidarity with the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia, we support\na number of players in D\u00fcsseldorf sports. The cooperation between Rheinmetall and the sports city of D\u00fcsseldorf\nincludes sports sponsorship of a handball league team. However, parts of the package also focus on promoting\nOlympic, youth and amateur sports as well as new trend sports.\nGiven the 2021 flood disaster in the Ahr valley, we decided to support civil disaster protection. In June 2022, we\ndonated two highly mobile HX 4x4 new vehicles to THW-Bundesvereinigung e.V. for use in two local associations\nin North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse. Thanks to their high robustness, mobility and 1.5-meter fording ability,\nthese two trucks are ideally suited for use in difficult terrain or flooded areas.\n136 RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information\nNon-financial statement\nSocial responsibility\nProduct responsibility\nSpecialist working groups in the divisions deal, for example, with safety and environmental standards for\nRheinmetall products. They are responsible for tracking new regulations and developments, defining and\nimplementing the required internal processes and conducting relevant training. Products in civilian business are\nsubjected to extensive testing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by automotive quality and\ndevelopment standards. The Sensors and Actuators division, for example, uses a database-supported process for\nproduct safety management, which maps out the entire product lifecycle. The Materials and Trade division uses\nspecial design and simulation tools. To prove product safety, in addition to tests carried out in testing facilities\noutside the engine, engine operation tests are also carried out with customers under various stress scenarios.\nInternal and external audits are carried out to regularly monitor compliance with the parameters of the quality\nmanagement system and the relevant processes. For the divisions operating in the field of security technology,\nthe guideline for implementing product safety sets out the basic requirements for ensuring the safety of Defence\nproducts in line with common standards and methods.\nIn the year under review, Rheinmetall Technology Management also dealt with further developments regarding the\ndigital product pass at the level of Germany (German Environment Agency: Product Information 4.0) and the\nEuropean Union (Sustainable Product Initiative and Incubation Forum for Circular Economy in European Defence\n\u2013 IFCEED). This is particularly intended to advance the circular economy.

The RWE Group has established a compliance management system (CMS) that is aligned to its risk exposure and aims to ensure adherence to legal provisions as well as internal guidelines and regulations. With the help of our CMS, we want to enshrine compliance as a core value, solidifying it in the thoughts and actions of our staff and thereby avoiding potential misconduct. In doing so, we are particularly diligent in identifying and avoiding the risk of corruption. Measures taken include consulting in case of isolated incidents and training courses. We also carry out regular compliance risk analyses. Our employees have access to a whistleblower channel \u2013 where they can choose to remain anonymous \u2013 to notify compliance officers if they witness violations or activity that could damage the business. For more information on our CMS, please refer to page 90 et seqq.\nWe subject the ICS to a comprehensive review every year. First, we examine whether the risk situation is presented appropriately and whether suitable controls are in place for the identified risks. Then, we test the effectiveness of the controls. ICS reviews that pertain to accounting-related processes, for example, to the preparation of financial statements or to consolidation, are conducted by employees from the Accounting Department. When it comes to processes handled by service centres on our behalf, for example invoice processing, an auditor certifies the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls. The representatives of the finance, human resources, procurement, trading and IT functions document whether the agreed ICS quality standards are adhered to by their respective areas. Our Internal Audit & Security Department provides assistance for the ICS reviews. The results of the reviews are documented in a report to the Executive Board of RWE AG. The review conducted in 2022 once again demonstrated that the ICS is effective.\nWithin the scope of external reporting, the members of the Executive Board of RWE AG take an initial half-year and a full-year balance-sheet oath, confirming that the prescribed accounting standards have been adhered to and that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the net worth, financial position and earnings. When in session, the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee regularly concerns itself with the effectiveness of the ICS. Once a year, the Executive Board of RWE AG submits a report on this to the Committee.\n74\n\n1 2\nTo our investors Combined review of operations\nNon-financial Group statement\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4 5\nConsolidated financial Further information statements\nEnvironment\nRWE Annual Report 2022\nthe Non-financial Statement primarily with the topics of strategic relevance to RWE. Previously, we reported above all based on the sustainability components of the remuneration of the Executive Board of RWE AG. This change in approach has resulted in some new topics being addressed by the report.\nEnvironmental issues play a prominent role for power producers. Our conventional and green energy assets mean that we have an impact on the climate, nature and environment. In the following sections, we report on our major strategic topics: climate change, innovation, biodiversity and the circular economy. We also comment on our environmental management system as well as how we record environmental events, as these topics represent components of the variable remuneration of the Executive Board.\nClear pledge to protect the climate. We are committed to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, which seek to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Decarbonisation of the electricity sector is a major factor. The latest reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal that urgent action is needed in order to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming. We emit greenhouse gases above all from our conventional power stations. At the same time, however, our capital expenditure on renewable energy is enabling us to switch to climate- friendly electricity production. Our business activities also result in our triggering emissions outside of our own operations, which are referred to as Scope 3 emissions. These stem, e. g. from the production of goods and services which we purchase as well as retail sales of gas and lignite products, which are then fired to generate electricity.\nWe want to be carbon neutral in all three scopes of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol by 2040. To this end, we are reducing our direct and indirect emissions. Our strategy is also oriented to hitting this target. By rapidly expanding renewable energy, we are making our contribution to decarbonising the electricity system. We will retrofit or close existing fossil-fuelled and conventional generation assets. Our plans envisage making a full exit from lignite-fired power production by 2030. We develop deployment schedules for our existing gas-fired power stations that enable them to generate electricity in a climate- friendly manner. Research in conversion to hydrogen plays a major role in this context, as does carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in some countries. We are converting our Dutch power plants, which run on hard coal and biomass, to constantly increase the share of biomass firing, so that we can stop generating electricity from hard coal by 2030\n       Section of the Non- financial Statement\n\n                  \u2013\n2 Our electricity generation amounted to 162,612 GWh in the 2022 reporting year, (2021: 166,560 GWh). Direct emissions of contract power plants are included in CO2 and electricity figures, but not in other figures, e. g. Scope 1. However, indirect emissions of power stations we do not own are disregarded, e. g. purchased goods and services or waste, water or input materials.\n3 It cannot be ruled out that proportions of Scope 2 emissions in data used for in-house consumption have already been considered in Scope 1 emissions.\n4 Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using input / output modelling based on our procurement volume. Further emission factors were optimised in the 2022 reporting year. Since 2021, we have been making increasing use of public libraries such as DEFRA and the GHG Scope 3 Evaluator.\n5 Emission factors used do not take account of radiative forcing.\n6 Includes, e. g. gas sold to end customers. Excludes commercial transactions without delivery to the end customer.\n0.1\n\n4 5 RWE Annual Report 2022 Consolidated financial Further information\nstatements\nRWE has set itself goals regarding various aspects of diversity. Information on targets imposed on supervisory boards and management by law in Germany can be found in the Corporate Governance Declaration, which has been published at www.rwe.com/corporate- governance-declaration. One objective is to have women in 30 % of managerial positions throughout the Group in the core business (i. e. excluding the Coal / Nuclear segment). This objective only applies to our core business as setting a goal for the Coal / Nuclear segment is not deemed practical given the personnel cuts necessary in this part of our business. In the year under review, we increased the quota to 20.8 % in part by filling vacancies at the management level. At the close of 2022, the 20-member Supervisory Board of RWE AG included seven women, four of whom are employer representatives. The share of women on the Executive Board of RWE AG was 33.3 %. Diversity and inclusion targets in Germany are supplemented by the legally prescribed 5 % quota for severely disabled people.\nRWE seeks to maintain good relationships and be regarded as a reliable partner. We report on some of these groups in this chapter, amongst other things as we comment on our approach to diversity, health and social responsibility. To us, the last of these topics encompasses engaging with local communities and municipalities.\nPromoting diversity and inclusion within the company. Every day, more than 18,000 employees give their all to ensure our company\u2019s success. The breadth of experience, backgrounds and talent in our company is what makes us unique and we believe this is an asset that helps our company grow. This highlights how important diversity is for RWE. Moreover, we are subject to statutory regulations in many markets, such as in relation to the number of women in managerial positions and antidiscrimination.\nIt is important to us to create a working environment that enables all our employees to reach their full potential at every stage of their career. Diversity, inclusion and antidiscrimination are enshrined throughout the Group in our Code of Conduct. We expressly oppose all forms of discrimination. In 2022, we reinforced this pledge in the RWE Antidiscrimination Policy. In addition to the Corporate Diversity & Inclusion team, which prepares objectives and measures, companies within the Group are also accountable for spurring activities going above and beyond this. Diversity champions are nominated for this. As regards employees, many groups and networks are active at RWE, including the advocate group for the disabled, the Women\u2019s Network, the LGBT*IQ & Friends Network, Diversity Ambassadors and the Empower Network for Disability, Neurodiversity and Mental Health. In addition to the network members, a large number of further employees actively helps to take measures and implement a lived, inclusive corporate culture. To promote gender diversity, the general rule at RWE is that all leadership and management positions shortlist a woman. Additional initiatives are carried out at the operational level. For example, hiring measures include a variety of one-on-ones with the aim of overcoming systemic bias. We raise awareness through campaigns and purpose-designed measures in the fields of personnel development, training, employment and health as well as suitable workplace designs and accessibility.\n\nemergency medical technicians, the continued development of measures to promote health and prevent illness and injury, ergonomic workplace design and counselling. The International Health Standard (IHS) of the RWE Group specifies the health products and services that must be offered to every RWE employee such as counselling to assist them in overcoming professional and personal challenges, referrals to specialised physicians and emergency care on business trips.\nWe aim to optimise the safety of every employee\u2019s workplace, be it in an office, at a wind farm, in an opencast mine or at one of our power stations. The object of our health management work is to offer staff members measures tailored to their needs through which they can maintain and promote their physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. Occupational safety is of central importance to the RWE Group and is thus linked to executive and management board remuneration. The key performance indicator established for occupational safety is the number of work-related accidents among in-house and contract staff resulting in at least one day of absence for every 1 million work hours (lost time incident frequency \u2013 LTIF). The target within the RWE Group is 1.9. This figure was exceeded in 2021, but the LTIF dropped back down to 1.5 in 2022. The LTIF for RWE personnel was 1.1 and also dropped compared to the preceding year. Our objective remains to allow not a single fatal work-related accident among our staff or the employees of our partner companies. Unfortunately a contract worker had a fatal accident while cleaning a coaling system at one of our power plants in November 2022.\nemployees with disabilities were initiated. Some examples are real-time subtitling, gaze controls and voice commands.\nStaying safe and healthy at RWE. The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees are particularly important to us as an employer. To keep an eye on all matters related to the variety of workplaces we have, occupational health and safety (H&S) has become a firm fixture in our corporate policy. The guiding principle \u2018All accidents are avoidable \u2013 we give priority to occupational health and safety\u2019 expresses our ambition in this area.\nThe Chief Human Resources Officer and Labour Director, who sits on the Executive Board of RWE AG, is responsible for the groupwide coordination and assessment of occupational H&S. She is informed, advised and assisted by the Health and Safety Unit of RWE Power AG which, in addition to providing occupational H&S services to RWE AG, also acts centrally in addressing general topics and pools expertise throughout the Group. Group companies have their own units dedicated to H&S. The Occupational Health and Safety Group Policy helps to organise and comply with H&S standards throughout the entire RWE Group. Designated executive board members and managing directors at the Group companies ensure implementation and compliance with H&S regulations. Each Group company is obligated to make at least one member of its executive or management board responsible for occupational H&S. We have established occupational safety management systems in our Group companies to facilitate achieving the company\u2019s H&S goals. The systems establish structures, goals and procedures. Corresponding guidelines and processes are monitored systematically and constantly improved adhering to the plan-do-check-act cycle. Furthermore, Group companies are advised to obtain external certification for their occupational safety management systems (e. g. ISO 45001). Tasks performed as part of the health management system satisfy the legal requirements in the relevant country. In Germany, these tasks primarily consist of services rendered by company physicians and\n87\n\n\nand local communities. At the same time, the construction and expansion of new power generation technologies will open the door to myriad opportunities and possibilities. As a company, it is incumbent upon us to shape this change transparently and in a socially acceptable manner. We strive to be a good employer, no matter where our employees work. Maintaining a dialogue to involve and communicate with them early on is important for us.\nRWE interacts with a large number of stakeholders on a daily basis. We take their interests into account to ensure that their views are considered in our goals and plans, from project planning and execution to operation. Accountabilities vary within the Group from one set of stakeholders to the next.\nRWE AG and its HR team create the framework for employees. The operating companies have their own HR departments, which implement independent processes and measures in areas such as career development and recruitment while taking account of regional needs.\nOperating functions manage their own contacts with local municipalities and communities in the areas in which they operate, paying due regard to national regulations and local requirements. This enables us to cater to local needs and expectations.\nIt is our ambition to make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate. To ensure a just transition, we stand by those of our employees whose jobs are affected by the energy transition and come up with socially acceptable solutions and prospects for them. To us, a just transition translates into treating employees, partners and communities both fairly and responsibly especially whenever disruptive steps are unavoidable. In our company, we want to offer a working environment that attracts new talent, promotes existing potential and provides fair, performance-based pay. The engagement index is an important indicator when it comes to measuring our success in this area. The index is compiled at the Group level, which ensures comparability with other industrial groups. Motivation reflecting the workforce\u2019s general perspective is polled once a year and has been documented in a groupwide survey since 2021. Four of the 24 questions expressly relate to the engagement\nNon-financial Group statement\n\n      As always, the incident is being investigated by conducting a root cause analysis. This method is applied to systematically identify the reasons for events with a view to developing measures and strategies to prevent them in the future. All fatal accidents and events that are very likely to lead to serious or fatal injuries are subjected to systematic investigations. Prevention programmes aiming to ensure responsible behaviour among executives are implemented in Group companies in order to convey the main elements of occupational H&S in the context of managing employees. The RWE Group stopped imposing international minimum standards for protective measures relating to the coronavirus in February 2022, transferring this responsibility to the operating companies. At present, Group companies and locations take measures to prevent corona from spreading in line with risk assessments made on site. These may include hygiene and social distancing rules, mandatory masks, mobile working, restrictions imposed on business travel, events and meetings as well as free corona tests.\nDriving change together and justly. Our company is undergoing a process of transformation. This is affecting both our employees and local communities. Despite the differences between these stakeholder groups, it is very important to us to interact with them honestly to enable just change. After all, the transformation of the working world 2.0 along with the challenging demographics and shortage of skilled labour it brings will change the way in which people work. As plants are decommissioned, sites that have often been operated for years will have to be closed down. This will affect employees, suppliers, partners\n\nor recruiting new employees. For RWE, it is important to attract new talent and retain skilled labour while increasing the staff\u2019s identification with our company. To this end, an employer brand under the motto \u2018Our energy has impact\u2019 and an employer value proposition were developed and launched in the year being reviewed. One improvement relates to the ways in which talent and interested individuals come across job offers. RWE\u2019s central career website was revamped extensively and now accepts applications without prior registration. Furthermore, the internal job board has been made uniform, enabling vacancies to be searched across borders. In the reporting year, all internal onboarding, offboarding and job change processes were reviewed, harmonised and standardised both groupwide and around the globe. These improvements guarantee uniform quality throughout the Group, paving the way for automation. This increases the efficiency of HR processes, provides everyone involved with an optimal experience and supports the growth strategy of our company. We are currently preparing for new ways of working in our offices, and work started on a pilot for hybrid offices in 2022. A pilot concept including office equipment and furnishings is being worked on at several locations. This mainly involves redesigning team rooms and offices in order to create a more comfortable working environment and create a balance between individual work stations and work spaces designed for interaction, in which colleagues can collaborate more effectively than in the past.\nIn addition to our employees, the people who live in the areas adjacent to and surrounding our facilities are important, and we involve them early on and \u2013 if possible \u2013 share the value added by our plants with them. Payments continued to be made via community funds in 2022. In the year under review, through wind farms operated by RWE in the UK and Ireland, we invested over #5 million in local communities. In Germany, we decided to give all communities in which an RWE wind farm or ground-mounted solar system is located a share of the profit in accordance with the German Renewable Energy Act. The \u2018RWE Climate Bonus\u2019 went into effect on 1 January 2023 and generally applies to existing facilities as well as future RWE assets once they are commissioned.\nindex. The indices and figures are determined applying the top 2 logic. This involves calculating the percentage share of people responding to questions by selecting one of the first two options (\u2018I agree entirely\u2019 and \u2018I agree\u2019). In the year being reviewed, the engagement index rose to 84 %, up 3 % compared to 2021 and surpassing the 78 % target. Therefore, all key indicators improved, based on a participation rate of 74 % (compared to 67 % in 2021).\n  Engagement index\n\n     There is no general indicator that would enable progress in local engagement to be measured. Due to the differences in approach, a variety of formats is evaluated by the responsible units to establish whether they are fit for purpose.\nWe are supporting the company\u2019s transformation by taking measures for our employees. Whereas the growth business involves recruiting new staff, we are confronted with necessary decommissioning activities in the Coal / Nuclear segment. Despite the manpower required for dismantling, in the next few years, thousands of jobs will have to be cut in a socially acceptable manner and existing staff will have to be transferred to new positions. The announced accelerated exit from lignite will have significant ramifications for many employees. We will need more personnel in the short term to operate power plants longer than envisaged during the European energy crisis caused by the continuing war in Ukraine. However, job cuts will pick up considerably towards the end of the decade. As before, RWE plans to carry out the personnel adjustment to the new decommissioning roadmap in a socially acceptable manner. One objective is to provide younger employees, who cannot take early retirement, with prospects within the company or with other employers. Extensive qualification and retraining measures will underpin the adjustment path. RWE AG\u2019s HR organisation was rearranged in the year under review to support the continued growth strategy. A focal point of the new structure will primarily consist of creating and improving services and processes, for instance when onboarding new staff members, identifying talent\n89\n\nResponsibility statement\n4 5 RWE Annual Report 2022 Consolidated financial Further information\nstatements\ntraining sessions to learn about specific behaviours and measures, in particular to avoid corruption and the appearance thereof. Mandatory compliance training is conducted once a year on a web-based platform with variable points of focus. Furthermore, employees attend in-person training sessions depending on the risks to which their work is exposed. The training concept also includes the Executive Board. We support our employees in notifying their superiors, the appropriate compliance officers / managers and / or the Chief Compliance Officer of RWE AG of potential breaches of our Code of Conduct and other non-compliant behaviour. In addition, throughout the Group our employees have access to a web-based whistleblower system. With the option of remaining anonymous, whistleblowers can use this system to report incidents, e. g. violations of our Code of Conduct or the German Basic Data Privacy Regulation, white-collar offences and actions that harm the company. Furthermore, our staff members and external entities such as vendors and other business partners can get in touch with an independent external contact via the phone or e-mail. We treat received tips confidentially and, if so desired, anonymously. We protect whistleblowers by all means necessary from the potential fallout of their notification. When following leads, we protect the justified interests of individuals affected by a notification. We investigate all tips pointing at potential compliance infractions. These are recorded by the Compliance Department and reviewed by the Group functions in charge of the investigation. Thereafter, if necessary, remedies are initiated as part of a systematic follow-up process. Necessary and appropriate measures are set in motion for all confirmed compliance violations committed by employees and / or business partners.\nThe Group\u2019s purchasing teams have established structures and processes to minimise the risk of bad business practices by our partners and vendors and to ensure ethical and responsible action. Various procurement teams were involved in purchasing transactions throughout the Group until the end of the year under review. The common basis for purchases is our Group Procurement Policy, which establishes the principles of procurement applicable throughout the Group. A reorganisation planned during the reporting year became effective at the beginning of 2023. The Code of Conduct is a binding element of contracts the Group signs with suppliers. By entering into these agreements, vendors pledge to observe our ethical and environmental principles and to put them into practice in their supply chains. We\nEntrepreneurial action in accordance with applicable laws and values is of great importance to us. Good company management and adequate corporate governance are indispensable in terms of achieving our growth goals and creating value for our stakeholders. In this chapter, we set out our approach and progress made in compliance and ethics.\nIntegrity and legal compliance are pillars of our action. We seek to grow in adherence to applicable laws while staying true to our own values and principles. In this context, we believe our priority topics compliance and ethics translate into preventing corruption and bribery while being guided by our values when working with our vendors and partners. They must meet the standards we impose on ourselves.\nAll our business activities and decisions meet pre-established compliance requirements. Corruption and all types of compliance infractions are not tolerated. As a preventive measure, we set up a Compliance Management System (CMS) for the RWE Group, which is regularly reviewed in accordance with the IDW 980 Audit Standard of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany and was last subjected to a review in 2021. Overarching control of the system is handled by the Chief Compliance Officer. Furthermore, Group companies in Germany and abroad have designated compliance officers, who work to ensure uniform implementation of groupwide compliance. The compliance officers report to the Chief Compliance Officer of RWE AG, who keeps the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee abreast of relevant issues such as developments in legislation, the refinement of the CMS and leads on potential compliance violations.\nThe main objective of the CMS is to permanently ingrain compliant behaviour in the mindset and actions of all staff members and strengthen the compliance culture within the Group in a sustainable manner. A regular compliance risk analysis is an integral component of the CMS. Departments and operating units are covered by the risk assessment conducted by the Compliance Department, which starts by identifying and assessing the key compliance risk fields and ends by deriving from the analysis any necessary measures. Our employees attend\n90\n\nConsolidated financial Further information statements\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n review business relations with partners whenever it becomes public knowledge that they have violated the principles of the UN Global Compact and take all measures necessary and appropriate from our point of view. When purchasing energy fuel and derivatives on trading markets, we also apply standards in an effort to minimise risks to us and to sustainability aspects. All potential trading partners are reviewed before we engage in business relations with them on the wholesale market and purchase coal, gas or biomass for use as fuel from them. This is done as a standardised, multi-stage process. We consult global databases and information systems to determine whether there are any indications of misconduct, irrespective of the purchasing volume contracted from the trading partner in question. Every trading partner is evaluated under application of the established know-your-customer (KYC) process and reviewed by RWE Supply & Trading.\nIt is important to us to have a strong compliance culture throughout the Group. All managers are obliged to report on the implementation of the Code of Conduct within their sphere of responsibility. Referred to as \u2018executives\u2019 compliance reporting\u2019, this is conducted once a year starting in the autumn, in order to create transparency with respect to adherence to the Code of Conduct and to provide an overview of compliance awareness at RWE. The feedback rate of this executives\u2019 compliance reporting serves as an indicator of attention to compliance. We aim for a feedback rate of 100 %, which was achieved yet again in 2022.\nCoverage of contracts with suppliers of which the Code of Conduct is an element %\nRWE Group\n\nIn our efforts to avoid corruption, we concentrated on sensitising our workforce in 2022 once again. The compulsory annual compliance training via a web-based programme focused on dealing with business partners. In addition, our employees are regularly informed via in-house media of further compliance matters such as breaking developments, existing and new Group policies, the requirements of compliant behaviour, and potential risks arising from infractions.\nIn 2022, we reviewed our responsibilities and processes in place to ensure due diligence in relation to human rights against the backdrop of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. From 2023 onwards, this law will oblige certain companies to observe due diligence obligations relating to human rights and environmental matters within their supply chains in a reasonable manner. In the year being reviewed, a risk management system was introduced to ensure adherence to due diligence obligations and was institutionalised for all material business transactions. This enables potential human rights and environmental risks to be detected and minimised while avoiding, ending or minimising the scope of human rights violations and breaches of environmental duties. Risk management also involved publishing a policy statement adopted by the Executive Board and designating a human rights officer. Once the law is enacted, this role will be assigned to the Head of the\nStrategy & Sustainability Department. The Human Rights Officer assists the sustainability\n     We aim to back all purchases from suppliers and partners with contracts including our Code of Conduct as an element. We also aim for this full contractual coverage of our business partners via our KYC process when sourcing fuel. We recorded another year of full coverage for both key figures in 2022.\n91\n\nConsolidated financial Further information statements\nEU Taxonomy\nRWE Annual Report 2022\nteam, monitors risk management and keeps the Executive Board updated on these issues. This occurs in close co-operation and agreement with the purchasing units and further units within the Group. In addition, each segment has established responsibilities for due diligence with regard to human rights. Within the scope of our risk management procedures, we performed a risk analysis to identify human rights and environmental risks in our business activities and at our direct suppliers in 2022 for the first time. The risk assessment did not reveal any substantial risks in our business operations. A few potential risks were detected at our direct suppliers and are being analysed further. Building wind and solar farms as well as battery storage systems requires some raw materials which may have to be mined under conditions that are critical in terms of human rights. Therefore, we also give high priority to monitoring the supply chains of these raw materials, which is a very challenging task. Through our human rights risk management system, we analyse critical commodities for human rights risks, create transparency in our supply chains and take measures to reduce risks.\nOnly by transforming the economy can sustainability goals be achieved. This requires substantial investments in climate and environmentally friendly technologies. The EU Taxonomy provides a system for classifying sustainable investments in the European Union.\nWith the introduction of the European Green Deal, the European Commission seeks to make the economy modern, resource-efficient and competitive, to enable zero net greenhouse gas emissions and decouple economic growth from resource consumption by 2050. The EU Taxonomy is a key element of the European Green Deal. It forms a system for a uniform classification of environmentally sustainable company activities. Business activities are analysed for their contribution to six defined environmental goals (climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). We published information on the first two environmental goals in the reporting year. Our investigation of the contribution made to achieving the aforementioned environmental goals revealed that our activities as an energy company, which predominantly consist of the production and storage of renewable energy, and thus reduce carbon dioxide emissions, make a major contribution to achieving the goal of climate change mitigation.\nSince 2021, we have been applying the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2020 / 852 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 18 June 2020 about setting up a framework for facilitating sustainable investments and for amending Regulation (EU) 2019 / 2088 (hereinafter referred to as EU Taxonomy). Last year, we applied the existing simplification rules and reported exclusively on the taxonomy-eligible activities. In the year being reviewed, we applied the regulations on reporting our taxonomy-aligned activities for the first time. Furthermore, we apply the regulations pursuant to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021 / 2139 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 9 March 2022 in relation to business activities in certain energy sectors and pursuant to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021 / 2178 in relation to special disclosure duties for these business activities. This is a regulation\n\n4 5 RWE Annual Report 2022 Consolidated financial Further information\nstatements\nrequirements defined for goal 5, \u2018pollution prevention and control\u2019, and proven via investigations are those for the activity \u2018hydrogen production\u2019. The delegated legal act defines criteria for all our activities in relation to goal 6, \u2018protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\u2019. Here, taxonomy alignment is achieved through compliance with requirements imposed by approval procedures and is proven at the asset level. This is done, e. g., by furnishing proof of environmental impact assessments and studies.\nAs regards the \u2018minimum safeguards\u2019, we lean on the report of the platform for sustainable finance on minimum safeguards and have focused our screening and proof of alignment on key topics for which honouring minimum guarantees at the company level based on EU and international standards have been defined as relevant. Human rights, corruption and bribery, taxes, competition and antitrust law and data privacy. Overall, we ensure minimum safeguards.\nWhen it comes to human rights, notable mention should be made of RWE\u2019s Code of Conduct, which provides a general explanation of human rights and the main labour standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). This Code of Conduct is binding on all employees and is an element of the contracts entered into by the purchasing teams. We have supplemented the Code with a policy statement on our human rights strategy.\nTo combat corruption and bribery, RWE has a compliance management system designed to detect corruption, which has been institutionalised in several Group regulations, among other things. The management system is regularly audited by an external auditing firm. Our staff members have a groupwide web-based whistleblower system and external contacts at their disposal.\nWe took a systematic approach at the Group level to goal 2 (climate change adaptation), which applies to all activities, and conducted the first cross-portfolio climate risk assessment for our taxonomy-aligned business activities in this reporting year. The assessment focused on climate projection scenarios that are the best possible fit for the lifetimes of our newest assets. In so doing, we also considered long-term scenarios. All the predefined and evaluable climate hazards listed in annex 2 to the delegated legal act were considered. The climate models do not contain any projection data relating to climate hazards caused by solid matter or certain serious events such as hailstorms. Projected changes to climate variables were identified using a group of global climate models. Various sources of uncertainty are mitigated by taking account of various driver scenarios, amongst other things. The first result of the assessment reveals a higher relevance for assets that are planned, under construction, or have recently been commissioned. In addition, as a rule, technology-dependent climate data were also analysed for material identified risks and adaptation solutions were implemented, some of which were extensive. Examples are flood protection for run-of-river power stations and retaining basins for plants with water-based cooling systems. The first step of the vulnerability assessment revealed, among other things, changes in wind, sunshine, precipitation and drought duration as being technology-specific climate hazards. The next step will involve looking at further specific data such as the age and service life of individual assets to concretise vulnerability.\nAccording to the delegated legal act, activities that help achieve goal 3, \u2018sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\u2019, must satisfy criteria regarding the impact of their construction and operation on existing bodies of water. Our offshore wind, hydropower and hydrogen production activities meet these criteria. The criteria that must be met are proven at the project and asset level by means of permit applications, environmental impact assessments, studies, and permit requirements in relation to bodies of water in co-ordination with the relevant authorities. Goal 4, \u2018transition to a circular economy\u2019, is being pursued systematically and is not significantly jeopardised. The transition to a circular economy is an element of our sustainability strategy. Associated processes are implemented throughout the Group. In addition, we prove that requirements are met by taking measures specific to the circular economy at the project and asset level.
