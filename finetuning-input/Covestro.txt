Committees of the Supervisory Board
In the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board had five permanent committees set up so that it can continue to
exercise its duties effectively and efficiently. The committees prepared resolutions by the full Supervisory Board
and provided information on other topics to be discussed by this body. Moreover, certain decision-making
powers of the Supervisory Board were delegated to the committees to the extent legally permissible. The
Supervisory Board currently has the following permanent committees: Presidial Committee, Audit Committee,
Human Resources Committee, Nominations Committee, and Sustainability Committee.
The tasks and responsibilities of the standing committees and their current composition are described in greater
detail in “Declaration on Corporate Governance” under “Committees of the Supervisory Board” in the Combined
Management Report.
The meetings and decisions of all committees, and especially those of the Audit and Sustainability Committees,
were prepared on the basis of reports and explanations provided by the Board of Management. The committee
chairs regularly provided comprehensive reports on the work of the committees to the full Supervisory Board.

The Presidial Committee, on which shareholders and employees are equally represented, made preparations in
the year 2022 for the decisions relating to the qualification matrix required by the new GCGC and convened for a
meeting for this purpose on November 23, 2022. This followed the preparation by the Nomination Committee of
a proposed qualification matrix, including a review of and adjustments to the Supervisory Board’s areas of skill.
The Audit Committee met a total of four times in the year under review: on February 21, May 2, July 25, and
October 24, 2022, each time in the presence of the CFO. Three of these meetings were also attended by the
auditor. The Audit Committee conducted a preparatory review of the Financial Statements of Covestro AG, the
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Covestro Group, the Combined Management Report, and the proposal
for the use of the distributable profit for the Supervisory Board. Additionally, it also discussed in detail the
respective audit report and in particular, along with the oral report by the auditor on the material results of the
audit. The Combined Management Report also included the Group’s nonfinancial statement. In conducting its
review, the Audit Committee found no grounds for objections. It recommended to the Supervisory Board to
approve the Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021 as well as to consent to
the Combined Management Report and the proposal for the use of the distributable profit. In addition, the Audit
Committee discussed with the Board of Management the half-year financial report in light of the results of the
review by the auditor, and the Q1 and Q3 2022 interim statements prior to their publication.
The Audit Committee monitored the accounting and financial reporting process and the appropriateness and
effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system,
including sustainability-related aspects, and deliberated on the audit of the Financial Statements and compliance.
In doing so, the Committee received reports, including from the heads of Corporate Audit and the Corporate Law,
Intellectual Property & Compliance functions and from the auditor. No material weaknesses were identified in the
internal control system for financial reporting purposes or the risk early warning system.
The Audit Committee additionally undertook preparations for the Supervisory Board’s proposal for the
appointment of the financial statement auditor by the AGM, the engagement of the auditor and agreement on the
auditor’s fee. It monitored the quality of the audit and the independence of the auditor as well as the
supplementary non-audit services provided in addition to the financial statement audit. In this context, the
committee had the auditor confirm their independence.
The Audit Committee discussed the audit risk assessment, audit strategy, audit planning, key audit matters, and
audit results with the auditor. The Chairman of the Audit Committee had regular feedback sessions with the
auditor on the audit progress and reported on this to the Audit Committee.
Particular topics discussed by the Audit Committee in the fiscal year under review were current and future
regulatory requirements for sustainability reporting and their implementation, including especially the
requirements of the EU Taxonomy; the amendments to the GCGC; pension plan asset management; information
security; and cyber risk management. Furthermore, the Audit Committee obtained information on an ongoing
basis on enhancements to the compliance management system (particularly regarding anti-corruption
measures), the handling of suspected compliance violations, progress in significant litigation, new legal and
regulatory risks, and the risk situation, risk tracking, and risk monitoring in the Group. The Corporate Audit function
provided regular reports about risk assessments.
The heads of the relevant corporate functions also participated in meetings of the Audit Committee on selected
agenda items, reported on these, and answered questions. In addition, the Chair of the Audit Committee
discussed important matters between meetings, particularly with the Supervisory Board Chair, the CFO and the
auditor. The key results of these discussions were reported regularly to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory
Board. The Audit Committee continued its practice of closed sessions in the year under review. They allow the
auditor and the committee during the meeting to have a discussion without the Board of Management being
present.

CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
In the reporting period, the Human Resources Committee met for a total of five meetings held on February 22,
April 21, June 9, September 28, and December 16, 2022. Topics of particular importance in connection with
long-term succession planning for the Board of Management in the past year also included the reappointment of
the CEO, Dr. Markus Steilemann, and the extension of his contract as well as succession planning for the CTO.
The CTO succession planning was on the agenda of the Human Resources Committee meetings in February,
June, and September.
In its first meeting on February 22, the committee discussed the CTO succession planning, as well as target
attainment by the members of the Board of Management, long-term variable compensation of the Board of
Management, and adjustments to the description of the compensation system for the Board of Management.
The meetings on April 21 and June 9 focused on the reappointment of the CEO and the extension of his contract.
In the fourth meeting held on September 28, the Human Resources Committee dealt in particular with the
reappointment of Dr. Klaus Schäfer and the extension of his contract and the appointment of Dr. Thorsten Dreier
as member of the Board of Management and successor to Dr. Schäfer as of July 1, 2023. It also approved
Dr. Thomas Toepfer’s membership of the Regional Advisory Council for the Central Region of Commerzbank AG.
The agenda of the meeting held on December 16 included the annual review of the appropriateness of Board of
Management compensation, long-term variable compensation of the Board of Management, and short-term
variable compensation for the current year.
The members of the Nomination Committee held a meeting on September 22 of the reporting year to discuss
the skills profile and the qualification matrix of the Supervisory Board required by the GCGC. The Nomination
Committee reviewed and added to the skills profile to meet the requirements of the new version of the GCGC. In
this meeting, the Nomination Committee also prepared the qualification matrix required by the GCGC, which was
subsequently processed further by the Presidial Committee.
The Sustainability Committee convened for a total of five meetings. In its first meeting on February 1, it dealt
with Covestro’s path to climate neutrality (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and related proposals on objectives
and implementation measures. The committee also discussed the EU’s chemicals strategy and the approach
adopted by Covestro in response. In its second meeting on March 30, the focus was on Scope 3 emissions and
how they relate to the circular economy. In the third meeting on June 7, the Scope 3/circular economy topic was
raised again on the basis of examples from the market. In addition, discussions centered on ratings by external
rating agencies on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, and the approach pursued by Covestro
in this regard. Another topic at this meeting was the concept for the K plastics trade fair in October 2022, with a
focus on sustainable solutions and the circular economy. In the fourth meeting on September 9, the committee
discussed the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring performance against targets. It also considered
the ESG aspect of “Compliance with human rights” and spent time on the topic of “Transparency of our reporting”
(current forms of reporting at Covestro and future requirements, in particular in accordance with the EU
Taxonomy Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). The topics focused on at the fifth
meeting on November 25 included a progress update on ESG reporting, the 2022 materiality assessment, and
the annual planning of the topics of the Sustainability Committee for the year 2023.

MANAGEMENT REPORT PROFILE
Combined Management Report of the Covestro Group and Covestro AG
The Combined Management Report pertains to both the Covestro Group and Covestro AG. This report covers
the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022. The presentation of the results of operations, financial position,
and net assets as well as the expected development, including the principal opportunities and risks, relate to the
Covestro Group, unless otherwise noted. Information that applies to Covestro AG only is identified accordingly.
The results of operations, financial position, and net assets of Covestro AG are presented in a separate chapter
of the Report on Economic Position. In addition, the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c
in conjunction with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB is integrated into the Group Management Report.
This includes the statements in accordance with the European Union’s Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).
A nonfinancial statement in accordance with Sections 289c through 289e of the HGB does not have to be
provided for Covestro AG.
Nonfinancial Reporting
Covestro reports comprehensively and transparently about topics important from the company's perspective
and for our stakeholders. We measure our sustainability performance using financial indicators as well as key
nonfinancial indicators published in the Group Management Report. Our objective here is to highlight how closely
linked environmental and societal factors are with responsible corporate governance and the long-term success
of our business. The Group Management Report and the supplementary sustainability information together
comprise our annual sustainability reporting. We supplement the nonfinancial information in the Group
Management Report by reporting additional content, which meets the requirements of the “with reference to GRI”
reporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) and is identified
separately.
For all reportable aspects, the nonfinancial statement includes the policies we pursue in addressing
environmental matters, employee matters, and social matters as well as respect for human rights and anti-
corruption and bribery matters, the due diligence processes followed, as well as the outcomes of these
strategies. Nonfinancial performance indicators are reported only when these are important to the Covestro
Group.
As an integral part of the Group Management Report, the nonfinancial statement was audited with reasonable
assurance by our auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf (Germany). The supplementary
sustainability information specifically identified as such additionally contributes to the transparency of our
reporting, which meets the requirements of the “with reference to GRI” reporting option of the Global Reporting
Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS). We voluntarily report the management approaches for
material topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). The supplementary sustainability information that is not part of
our statutory audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements was subjected to a separate review with limited
assurance pursuant to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 by KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf (Germany).
Environmental Performance Indicators
Environmental protection performance indicators are reported for all fully consolidated companies. Since these
figures are calculated only at the end of the year, they include the group of companies consolidated as it stands
at year-end. In this process, we incorporate data from all environmentally relevant Covestro sites, i.e., all
production sites and relevant administrative sites. This data is used in addition to the environmental reporting
contained in this report to communicate with various stakeholders, e.g., associations, the press, and government
agencies, as well as to continually improve our environmental performance. In order to comply with publication
deadlines, the sites estimate the environmental data for the final weeks of the current fiscal year on the basis of
established estimation methodologies that ensure accurate reporting of data as close as possible to the actual
figures for the year. If, however, in the course of the following year, we become aware of material deviations based
on internally defined thresholds, the figures in question are corrected retroactively. This was not required in fiscal
2022 for the preceding fiscal year 2021.
32 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
The reporting of direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, e.g., from burning fossil energy sources and from our
production processes (Scope 1), of indirect GHG emissions from the provision and use of energy produced
outside the company (Scope 2), and of GHG emissions from upstream and downstream processes in the value
chain (Scope 3), is based on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes all fully consolidated
companies. If, in our efforts to achieve climate neutrality, measures are taken to offset emissions in relation to our
Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, they are disclosed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The
global warming potential (GWP) factors correspond to the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Alternative Performance Measures
Throughout its financial reporting, Covestro uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to assess the
business performance of the Group. These are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) adopted by the European Union (EU). These non-IFRS indicators should be considered a supplement to,
not a replacement for, the financial performance measures determined in accordance with IFRSs. The alternative
performance measures of relevance to the Covestro Group include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization (EBITDA), return on capital employed (ROCE), free operating cash flow (FOCF), and net financial
debt. The calculation methods for the APMs may vary from those of other companies, thus limiting the extent of
the overall comparability. These alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation or employed
as an alternative to the financial indicators determined in accordance with IFRSs and presented in the
Consolidated Financial Statements for purposes of assessing Covestro’s results of operations, financial position,
and net assets.
Explanations of the definition and calculation of these alternative performance measures can be found in the “Management” section.
33 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Internal Control System to Ensure Compliance
Compliance risks are systematically identified and assessed as part of Covestro’s Group-wide risk management.
Risk owners assess the compliance risks that have been identified. A risk matrix is used to define focal points of
compliance tasks at Covestro. The findings of a risk-based analysis enabled Covestro to identify four key topics:
antitrust law, corruption, data protection, and foreign trade law. The General Counsel/Chief Compliance Officer is
the risk owner responsible for breaches of antitrust law and corruption, while the Global Export Control Officer
oversees the risk of breaches of foreign trade law, and the Group Data Protection Officer is assigned to handling
the risk of loss and improper handling of personal data. With respect to corruption, areas including gifts and
invitations, relationships with government officials, and relationships with certain business partners such as sales
agents were identified as being especially risk-relevant. A corruption risk analysis was performed in the year
under review for all companies in which Covestro holds a majority interest. If the risk profile changes, new
controls are implemented if needed.
Many controls have been implemented at both the global and local levels to reduce the number of compliance
risks. To the extent possible, we integrate the compliance controls into our internal control system. The
effectiveness of the compliance controls is evaluated on the basis of a cascaded self-assessment system, as are
the ICS processes for accounting and financial reporting. The results of the effectiveness evaluations are
documented in the global system for the ICS processes. The Corporate Audit function regularly reviews the
compliance activities in independent, objective audits as part of dedicated compliance checks in the larger
companies. In the smaller companies, compliance aspects are part of a general review.
Risk Management System
Covestro has implemented a structured risk management process for the early identification of any potentially
disadvantageous developments that could have a material impact on our business or endanger the continued
existence of the company. This process satisfies the legal requirements regarding an early warning system for
risks pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, and is aligned with the
international risk management standard COSO II Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework (2004).
Risk management system
155 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Corporate Risk Management defines, coordinates, and monitors the framework and standards for this risk
management system, ensuring adequate risk communication and reporting to both management and the risk
managers. Covestro uses risk management software that simplifies the aggregation of risks, provides displays of
various interdependencies, and compares individual risks to the risk bearing capacity.
Risks are identified, evaluated, and controlled in the operating divisions and corporate functions by the respective
risk managers, who are organized in various global sub-committees. The Covestro Corporate Risk Committee
met three times in fiscal 2022 to review the risk landscape as well as the various risk management and monitoring
mechanisms that are in place, and to take any necessary measures. Additionally, we conduct an ad-hoc process
for newly identified risks throughout the year so that these are immediately incorporated into the risk
management system. These ad-hoc risks are identified and their handling is determined based on risk
assessments and depending on the defined thresholds. In addition, the Corporate Audit function complements
the monitoring process with process-independent monitoring.
Financial risks are evaluated using estimates of the potential impact after taking into account countermeasures
and the likelihood of their occurrence. The potential economic losses are projected using the expected EBITDA
loss and, in some individual cases, the FOCF loss. All material risks and the respective countermeasures are
documented in the risk management software, which is used throughout the Group. The risk management
system is reviewed regularly over the course of the year. Significant changes must be promptly entered in the
software and reported to the Board of Management. In addition, a report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the
Audit Committee several times a year and to the Supervisory Board at least once a year.
Nonfinancial risks associated with our own business activities, business relations, or products are also recorded.
The extent of losses associated with these risks is evaluated on a quantitative and/or qualitative basis. In
quantitative evaluation, any potential EBITDA loss is estimated. This also takes into consideration any
countermeasures that have a mitigating effect on the potential extent of losses or the probability of the risk. A
qualitative assessment of the impact is made on the basis of criteria such as strategic effect, influence on our
reputation, or possible loss of confidence among groups of stakeholders.
The following matrix illustrates the quantitative and qualitative criteria for rating a risk as high, medium, or low. The
same applies to the classification of nonfinancial risks.
Rating matrix
1 An individual risk that could have both a direct financial and an indirect financial impact of different severities is always classified based on the higher level of risk.
156 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Process-Independent Monitoring
The effectiveness of our management systems is evaluated at regular intervals by the Corporate Audit function,
which performs an independent and objective audit focused on verifying compliance with laws and policies.
Corporate Audit also supports the company in achieving its goals by systematically evaluating the efficiency and
effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes and helping to improve them. This
includes internal monitoring of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk
management system. The selection of audit targets follows a risk-based approach. Corporate Audit performs its
duties according to internationally recognized standards. The Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee is regularly
informed about the results of audits and also receives an annual report on the internal control system and its
effectiveness.
Risks in the areas of occupational health and safety, plant safety, environmental protection, and product quality
are assessed through specific health, safety, environment, energy, and quality (HSEQ) audits.
The external auditor assesses the early warning system for risks as part of its audit of the financial statements,
focusing on whether the system is fundamentally suitable for identifying at an early stage any risks that could
endanger the company’s continued existence so that suitable countermeasures can be taken. The auditor also
reports at regular intervals to Covestro AG’s Board of Management and the Audit Committee as well as the
Supervisory Board on the results of the audit and any weaknesses identified in the internal control system. Audit
outcomes are also taken into account in the continuous improvement of our management processes.
Opportunities and Risks
Overall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks
Particularly in the year 2022, Covestro’s business environment was severely affected by geopolitical events, such
as the Russian war against Ukraine, a rise in inflation trends around the world, higher energy and raw material
prices, disrupted global supply chains, and the global acceleration in recessionary trends. However, the overall
opportunity and risk position of the Group, has not changed significantly compared to the previous year. The
latest assessment of financial and nonfinancial risks shows that none of the risks reported below endanger the
company’s continued existence. Nor could we identify any risk interdependencies that could combine to
endanger the company’s continued existence.
Based on our product portfolio, our know-how, and our innovation capability, we are confident that we can use
the opportunities resulting from our business practices and successfully master the challenges resulting from the
risks stated below.
Opportunities and Risks in General and in the Company’s Business Environment
The risks outlined below may have material effects on EBITDA and, in individual cases, the FOCF of our Group
within the one-year forecast period. In this context, risks are deemed material if the potential loss to Covestro is
estimated at €50 million or more and/or they have at least a moderate potential qualitative impact. The likelihood
of occurrence of the risks is used for internal management purposes to define focus areas for the Corporate Risk
Committee. The risks are more highly aggregated in this report than in our internal documentation. Various
individual risks are combined into risk categories we have defined for this purpose. The following overview shows
the levels of risk allocated to the individual risks within each category. A risk category can therefore include more
than one weighted risk occurrence level. The order in which the risk categories are listed does not reflect their
significance. Unless explicit information to the contrary is provided, the opportunities and risks described below
always refer to both segments of Covestro.
Financial opportunities and risks that affect neither EBITDA nor FOCF are presented separately at the end of the
chapter.
157 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Risk management considers risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group’s objectives by having a
negative impact on the existing business or strategic goals. They are included in our risk portfolio, which is in turn
linked to the material sustainability topics and the topics of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD).

Risk categories by weighted risk occurrence
Business Environment
Geopolitical Tensions and Social Upheavals
In the year 2022, we saw geopolitical tensions between regional powers, whose effects included a decline in
product demand, rising energy and raw material prices, and disruptions in the supply chains. There is great
general uncertainty about how existing trade conflicts and tensions will develop, including the associated
macroeconomic implications, which could also have an impact on Covestro’s business situation.
Market Development
General economic conditions worldwide and, in particular, in the geographic regions in which Covestro operates
are a significant factor affecting the company’s earnings, since their effect on the industries in which Covestro’s
direct and indirect customers operate affects demand for our company’s products.
Negative economic developments triggered by a variety of events may have a negative impact on the global
economy and international financial markets in general. As a rule, this also adversely affects the sales markets for
our products, which then usually decreases Covestro’s sales volumes and earnings. However, the extent of the
impact of economic developments on sales volumes and earnings also depends on capacity utilization rates in
the industry, which in turn depend on the balance between supply and demand for the industry’s products.
Downturns in demand lead to reduced sales volumes and, ultimately, to reduced capacity utilization, which
negatively impacts margins. Conversely, a positive economic environment characterized by growth and upward
trends normally leads to improved business success.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Covestro’s corporate governance is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles.
Covestro places great importance on responsible corporate governance. This promise to shareholders, business
partners, and our employees is based on our commitment to the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)
and Articles of Incorporation that reflect these standards. In pursuing our business activities, we follow company
principles that exceed the requirements of the law and the GCGC. A key concern is combining business success
with environmental and social goals, so when making any business decision, we always consider the three
dimensions of sustainability – people, planet, profit. The principles guiding our actions, which are also based on
these dimensions, are documented in six policies applicable throughout the Group. These provide our employees
with guidance in the areas of value creation; sustainability; innovation; employees; health, safety, environment,
energy, and quality (HSEQ); and compliance. The standards contained in these policies are mandatory for all
employees worldwide.

Board of Management
Duties and Activities of the Board of Management
The Board of Management runs the company on its own responsibility with the goal of sustainably increasing the
company’s enterprise value and achieving defined corporate objectives. In doing so, it takes into account the
interests of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. The Board of Management performs its duties
according to the law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Management’s rules of procedure, and the
recommendations of the GCGC as stated in the Declaration of Conformity. It ensures compliance with the law
and internal company policies, and works with the company’s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.
The current rules of procedure of the Board of Management are available at: https://www.covestro.com/rulesofprocedure2022
The Board of Management defines the long-term goals and strategy for the company and sets forth the
principles and policies for the resulting corporate policies. Furthermore, it coordinates and monitors the most
important activities, defines the company’s portfolio, develops and deploys managerial staff, allocates resources,
and decides on the management and reporting of the Covestro Group. In this context, the Board of Management
ensures that both, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with social and environmental factors,
and the ecological and social impact of the company’s activities are systematically identified and assessed. In
addition to the long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy also takes ecological and social goals into
account. Corporate planning incorporates appropriate financial and sustainability-related goals.
During their period of service for Covestro, Board of Management members are subject to a comprehensive non-
compete clause. They are obligated to work in the company’s interests at all times and may not pursue any
personal interests in making decisions for the company or take advantage of the company’s business
opportunities for themselves. All Board of Management members are required to disclose any conflicts of
interest to the Chair of the Supervisory Board’s Human Resources Committee and the Board of Management
Chair, and inform the other Board of Management members of this fact. Other duties, particularly holding seats on
Supervisory Boards or comparable governing bodies at companies outside the Group, may only be assumed with
the approval of the Supervisory Board.
The members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole. However,
the individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within the framework of
the decisions made by the full Board. The allocation of duties among the members of the Board of Management
is defined in a written schedule appended to its rules of procedure and listed in the following table. The full Board
of Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in cases where a decision of the
full Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of procedure of the Board of Management
contain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by the full Board.
Board of Management meetings are held regularly and are convened by the Chair of the Board of Management.
Any member of the Board of Management may also request that a meeting be convened, notifying the other
members of the matter for discussion. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the
votes cast, except where unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chair casts the deciding vote.
According to the Board of Management’s rules of procedure, the Chair bears particular responsibility for
functional coordination of all Board of Management areas. The Chair represents the Board of Management as
well as Covestro AG and the Group in dealings with the public and other third parties.

Compliance
Compliance Management System
Our corporate conduct is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as ethical principles. Compliance with
legal and regulatory requirements is integral to our operations. It is only in this manner that we can sustainably
increase the company’s enterprise value and safeguard our reputation.
Compliance Culture and Targets
In its Corporate Compliance Policy, Covestro has specified a Group-wide code of conduct that mandates
fundamental principles and rules for all employees. This code of conduct details our commitment to fair
competition, integrity in business dealings, the principles of sustainability and product stewardship, data
protection, upholding of foreign trade and insider dealing laws, the separation of business and private interests,
proper record-keeping and transparent financial reporting, as well as to providing fair, respectful, and
nondiscriminatory working conditions. These requirements apply within the company as well as to all interactions
with external partners and the general public. Our code of conduct provides a framework for all decisions by the
company and our employees. The Corporate Compliance Policy is available on our intranet and on our website,
and is part of an information packet distributed to new employees when they are hired.

Covestro is aware that employees will likely embrace and exhibit integrity if managers are excellent role models.
The Board of Management states very clearly in its Corporate Compliance Policy for all staff that, above and
beyond any legal requirements, Covestro elects not to conduct any business activities that would violate our
rules and that management staff is prohibited from instructing employees otherwise. In this way, management
continuously fosters our compliance culture by, for example, regularly drawing employees’ attention to
compliance topics and their significance to the company. At Covestro town hall meetings, for example, Board of
Management members regularly present recent compliance cases to employees and underscore the importance
of complying with statutory requirements and internal regulations.
See “Corporate Commitments.”
We want to utilize our compliance management system in order to:

We have taken steps to meet our targets, including implementing an internal control system to ensure
compliance rules are followed. The insights gained from our annual evaluation of effectiveness are leveraged in
our efforts to continually improve our compliance management system.

Compliance Organization
The Chief Compliance Officer is in charge of all compliance activities at Covestro, and in this function reports
directly to the Board of Management. The corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function is the single
point of contact that coordinates Group-wide compliance activities. Chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
of Covestro, the Compliance Committee is the Group’s top-level decision-making body on these issues. The
Committee’s responsibilities include the following: exercising a Group-wide compliance governance function,
initiating and approving compliance-related regulations, and approving the annual training plan. In the reporting
period, the Compliance Committee met a total of four times. The suitability and effectiveness of compliance
activities are regularly reviewed by the Corporate Audit function in independent, objective audits.
See “Process-Independent Monitoring.”
Data privacy is under the responsibility of the corporate Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance function and is
coordinated Group-wide. By defining controls and processes, the function works to ensure compliance with legal
requirements (in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) and legal judgments to protect
personal data of employees, as well as of business partners, media representatives, etc. Local Data Privacy
Officers have been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. They serve as local points of
contact for employees on all questions regarding data privacy. The Board of Management is informed regularly
about activities in the company relating to data privacy law.
A local Compliance Officer has also been appointed for each country in which Covestro has employees. This
person serves as a local point of contact for employees on all questions regarding legally and ethically correct
conduct in business situations. The country organizations also have local compliance committees.
Communications and Compliance
Covestro systematically conducts training courses on compliance. Once focus areas have been specified, target
groups are defined for each content category and the employees (including managerial staff) are invited.
Covestro expressly encourages its employees to openly address any doubts about proper conduct in business
situations and to solicit advice. We inform all employees whom they can contact if they have any doubts or
questions. Covestro has also set up a whistleblowing tool. Employees and third parties can report potential
compliance violations through a hotline accessible worldwide or use an online tool that also permits anonymous
reports. In addition, employees can also report any compliance incidents to their supervisors or to the
Compliance organization.
Additional information is available at: www.covestro.com/en/company/management/compliance
An internal policy sets out the principles for handling compliance incidents at Covestro. All suspected
compliance incidents are recorded in a central database. Confirmed violations are evaluated, and organizational,
disciplinary, or legal measures are taken if necessary.
Compliance incidents are regularly reported to the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the
business entities’ management teams. Moreover, a current overview of incidents, including additional information
on various aspects and developments related to this topic, is published in a monthly Compliance Telegram on the
intranet. This ensures a high degree of transparency for all employees.
On a quarterly basis, all companies document risks arising from pending or current legal or administrative
proceedings. Relevant cases are reported on a regular basis to the Board of Management and to the Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board. The material legal risks are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

DISCLOSURES ON SUSTAINABILITY
REPORTING AND GRI INDEX
Covestro aims to help protect the environment, conserve limited resources, advance society, and create value, all
by firmly integrating sustainability into our Group strategy and management.
Our sustainability reporting is based on recognized standards. We report on material topics and nonfinancial
performance indicators pursuant to Section 315 (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in our Group
Management Report and supplement this information with additional content, which meets the requirements of
the “with reference to” reporting option of the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards
(SRS); this option has been available since the year 2022. We voluntarily report the management approaches for
material topics in accordance with GRI 3-3 (2021). We plan to check whether the use of voluntary GRI reporting
under the “in accordance with GRI” option is appropriate against the backdrop of regulatory developments.
Nonfinancial Group Statement
We publish the nonfinancial Group statement pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with
Sections 289c through 289e HGB as an integrated part of the Group Management Report. The respective
sections include the strategies we pursue in addressing environmental, labor, and social issues as well as
protecting human rights and fighting corruption and bribery, including the due diligence processes followed and
measures implemented, as well as the outcomes of these strategies.
We applied the GRI standards as a framework for preparing the nonfinancial Group statement.
Key topics relevant to the nonfinancial Group statement are identified in an internal process and in consideration
of their significance and implementation within the company. The starting point for this is the materiality
assessment and the material sustainability topics identified or updated as a result, i.e., the topics that are of
medium or high relevance to Covestro and on the aspects of which Covestro’s business activities have a medium
or high impact. The following table provides an overview of the key sustainability topics with an eye to the relevant
aspects and contains references to the specific sections in the Group Management Report. In order to identify
and address current developments and sustainability-related opportunities and risks at an early stage, we also
review whether there are any new findings relevant to opportunity and risk management. No material risks have
been identified in connection with Covestro’s own business activities, business relationships, or products that
have or are very likely to have a severely negative impact on the nonfinancial aspects of the company’s business.
See “Opportunities and Risks Report.”

187 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
For economic activity 3.10 – Manufacture of hydrogen, we potentially make a substantial contribution to the
environmental objective of climate change mitigation for selected sites. However, we are not yet able at present to
fully meet the stringent quality requirements (e.g., product-related lifecycle assessments [LCAs] that go beyond
externally certified methodology assessments) that the EU Taxonomy imposes on the evidence to be provided.
Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)
For an activity to qualify as a substantial contribution to one environmental objective, the EU Taxonomy requires
that it does not cause significant harm to the five other environmental objectives. In connection with the
environmental objective of climate change mitigation, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was conducted
for activity 3.10 – Manufacture of hydrogen at site level, using Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6,
4.5, and 8.5. With regard to the environmental objective of sustainable use and protection of water and marine
resources, a risk assessment was likewise performed to establish any possible environmental damage at site
level. For the environmental objective of transition to a circular economy, no criteria had been defined for the
economic activity analyzed at the time of publication of this report. As a result, compliance is currently not bound
by any criteria. The criteria for ensuring that no significant harm is done for the environmental objective of
pollution prevention and control were reviewed in two steps. Employees with the relevant professional expertise
examined compliance with the requirements for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation set out
in Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation on climate change mitigation in connection
with the specified guidelines and regulations. At the same time, compliance with the emission values in
connection with the best available techniques (BATs) was verified for the sites at which products are
manufactured with which we make a substantial contribution to meeting the environmental objective of climate
change mitigation. Finally, a check was performed at site level to make sure that no significant harm is done to the
environmental objective of protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
For activity 3.10 – Manufacture of hydrogen, proof could be provided for the environmental objective of climate
change mitigation that no significant harm was done to the other five environmental objectives. The only
exception is Appendix C of Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation for the environmental objective of
climate change mitigation due to interpretation uncertainty about the provision of evidence, especially in relation
to subitem g. Taxonomy-eligible products that either do not make a substantial contribution to meeting the
environmental objective of climate change mitigation or cause significant harm to at least one environmental
objective are not classified as taxonomy-aligned.
Minimum Safeguards
Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to establish processes and procedures to ensure
compliance with different rules and regulations. They relate in particular to human rights (including labor and
consumer rights), corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition. These requirements correspond to
Covestro’s culture, which we have made an integral part of our actions on the basis of existing Corporate
Commitments, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and various Group regulations. To ensure compliance with all legal
and Group-wide provisions, regulations, guidelines, and standards, including those relevant to the minimum
safeguards of the EU Taxonomy, we have implemented processes and controls (e.g., as part of the compliance
management system, the internal control system, or the integrated Health, Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality
management system).
See “Corporate Policies,” “Health and Safety,” “Sustainability in the Supply Chain,” “Human Rights,” “Compliance,” and note 26
“Legal Risks” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
189 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
The review of the minimum safeguards for human rights relates to Covestro’s overarching management
approach to respecting human rights, and primarily to the risk analysis conducted as part of the human rights due
diligence. In addition to the company’s own business activities, this also covers our direct suppliers. It also
considers the upstream supply chain, especially if there are specific allegations. The comprehensive and ongoing
risk analysis covers all of Covestro’s own sites, the supply chain, as well as the use phase and end-of-life of our
products. Depending on the respective risk assessments, various measures are agreed with the suppliers, e.g.,
supplier assessments under the TfS initiative* or special human rights training.
See “Sustainability in the Supply Chain” and “Human Rights.”
In addition, as part of the review to establish compliance with the minimum safeguards, we verified at Group level
that no final court judgments have been handed down against Covestro in connection with the above issues.
Although no economic activities were reported as taxonomy-aligned in the year 2022, there are no indications
based on the review described above to suggest that Covestro does not meet the minimum safeguards under
Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
We are planning further activities to be undertaken by our cross-functional Human Rights Task Force, such as
additional training for buyers, the completion of guidance for buyers with various measures for suppliers
prioritized during the risk analysis, or the introduction of a Group-wide guideline on our human rights-related
management system.
Result of the Alignment Check
In fiscal 2022, we did not identify any taxonomy-aligned economic activities associated with the environmental
objective of climate change mitigation.
Calculation of Taxonomy KPIs
We calculate taxonomy KPIs and report on the nature of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic
activities in accordance with Article 10(3) and Article 11(3) of the Taxonomy Regulation. We are required to report
the share of turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) that are generated by
taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned activities. The way in which we define and document these KPIs and run
the data queries for the calculations prevents double-counting amounts when allocating turnover, CapEx, and
OpEx to our economic activities. Where data could not be definitively allocated or KPIs had to be split between
economic activities, we applied allocation models appropriate for the particular process to reflect the technical
circumstances in the KPI calculation. The taxonomy KPIs are determined with system support in processes
established for the purpose. Validation steps are taken and the data is checked against the figures in the Group’s
Consolidated Financial Statements to ensure the data is complete and correct. Controls in our Internal Control
System are used to support the underlying systems and processes.
See “Main Features of the Internal Control System.”
Turnover
In order to determine the turnover generated by Covestro from taxonomy-eligible economic activities, we
allocated the relevant Covestro products to these activities. The corresponding turnover for fiscal 2022 was then
calculated for the identified products and a ratio derived using the Covestro Group’s sales reported in the Income
Statement (denominator). Turnover generated from the activity of high-efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and
power from fossil gaseous fuels is calculated in the same way.
See “Covestro Group Consolidated Income Statement.”

Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities generally comprise primary financial liabilities and negative fair values of derivatives.
In subsequent periods, such nonderivative liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method. The Covestro Group does not opt to measure financial liabilities at fair value, e.g., to avoid or minimize
accounting mismatches.
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has expired.
Netting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities in the context of master netting or similar agreements are netted and the
net amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position if the Covestro Group has a present
legal entitlement to offset the recognized amounts against one another and there is the intention to balance them
on a net basis or at the same time to settle the corresponding liability with realization of the asset.
Provisions for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits
Within the Covestro Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and defined
benefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or privately
administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual, or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been
paid, the company has no further payment obligations. The regular contributions constitute expenses for the year
in which they are due. As such, they are included in the functional cost items, and thus in EBIT. All other post-
employment benefit systems are defined benefit plans, which may be either unfunded, i.e., financed by provisions,
or funded, i.e., financed through pension funds.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations and the resulting expense are calculated in accordance with
IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) using the projected unit credit method. The future benefit obligations are valued by
actuarial methods and spread over the entire employment period on the basis of specific assumptions regarding
beneficiary structure and the economic environment. These relate mainly to the discount rate, future salary and
pension increases, variations in health care costs, and mortality rates.
The discount rates used are calculated from the yields of high-quality corporate bond portfolios in specific
currencies with cash flows approximately equivalent to the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The
uniform discount rate derived from this interest rate structure is thus based on the yields, on the closing date, of a
portfolio of corporate bonds with at least an AA or AAA rating whose weighted residual maturities approximately
correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.
The fair value of plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligation for pensions and
other post-employment benefits to determine the net defined benefit liability. Plan assets in excess of the benefit
obligation are reflected in other receivables, subject to the asset ceiling specified in IAS 19. Comprehensive
actuarial valuations for all major plans are performed annually as of December 31.
The balance of all income and expenses relating to defined benefit plans, except the net interest on the net
liability, is recognized in EBIT. The net interest is reflected in the financial result.
The effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in other comprehensive income.
They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets, and changes in the effects of the asset
ceiling, less the respective amounts included in net interest for the last two components. Deferred taxes relating
to the effects of remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.
251 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Other Provisions
Other provisions are measured in accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent
Assets) or, where applicable, IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Where the cash outflow to settle an obligation is
expected to occur after one year, the provision is recognized at the present value of the expected cash outflow.
Claims for reimbursements from third parties are separately recognized in other receivables if their realization is
virtually certain.
If the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the
corresponding amount and the resulting income generally recognized in the functional cost item(s) in which the
original charge was recognized.
To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain provisions that could have a material effect on the
net assets, financial position, and results of operations are selected and tested for their sensitivity to changes in
the underlying parameters using sensitivity analysis. To reflect uncertainty about the likelihood of the assumed
events actually occurring, the impact of a five-percentage-point change in the probability of occurrence is
examined in each case.
Provisions for environmental protection are recognized if future cash outflows are likely to be necessary to
ensure compliance with environmental regulations or to carry out remediation work based on an obligation, such
costs can be reliably estimated, and no future benefits are expected from such measures.
Estimating the future costs of environmental protection and remediation involves many uncertainties, particularly
with regard to the status of laws, regulations, and the information available about conditions in the various
countries and at the individual sites. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in
similar cases, the conclusions in expert opinions obtained for existing environmental programs, current costs,
and new developments affecting these costs. Also taken into consideration are management’s interpretation of
current environmental laws and regulations, the number and financial position of third parties that may become
obligated to participate in any remediation costs on the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely
to be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results.
Taking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature,
Covestro’s management believes the existing provisions to be adequate based upon currently available
information. Given the business environment in which the Covestro Group operates and the inherent difficulties in
accurately estimating environmental liabilities, material additional costs beyond the amounts accrued may be
incurred under certain circumstances. It may transpire during remediation work that additional expenditures are
necessary over an extended period and that these exceed existing provisions and cannot be reasonably
estimated.
Provisions for restructuring are based either on a legal or a constructive external obligation. They only cover
expenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are necessary for restructuring, and are not related to
future business operations. Such expenses include severance payments to employees and compensation
payments in respect of rented property that can no longer be used. Prior to recognition of this type of provision,
the associated assets are tested for impairment.
Restructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of
business activities, leveraging of portfolio synergies, or fundamental reorganizations of business units. The
respective provisions are recognized when a detailed restructuring plan has been drawn up, resolved by the
responsible decision-making level of management, and communicated to the affected employees and/or their
representatives. Provisions for restructuring are generally recognized at the present value of future cash
outflows.
As a company with international operations, the Covestro Group is exposed to numerous legal risks for which
provisions for litigation must be recognized under certain conditions – especially in the areas of product liability,
competition and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax law, environmental law, and compliance issues such as
corruption and export control.
252 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Litigation and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and
complexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the jurisdiction in
which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. The outcomes of currently pending and future
proceedings generally cannot be predicted. Judgment in court proceedings, regulatory decisions, or the
conclusion of a settlement may result in the Covestro Group incurring charges for which no accounting
measures have been taken for lack of reasonable estimate or which exceed established provisions and insurance
coverage.
The Covestro Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, and
the extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its Law, Intellectual Property &
Compliance corporate function and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Covestro Group.
Where it is more likely than not that such litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably
estimable, a provision for litigation is normally recognized in the amount of the present value of the expected
cash outflows. Such provisions cover the estimated unavoidable payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural
costs, attorney costs, and the cost of potential settlements.
It is often impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the
probability that a potential outflow of resources will result from pending or future litigation. Due to the special
nature of these litigation, provisions are generally not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of
potential amounts or judgments have been issued, and not before at least a range of possible legal outcomes of
such litigations can be determined. Provisions for legal defense costs are recognized if it is probable that material
costs will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the company’s legal position and an outflow of
resources can generally be expected.
Internal and external legal counsels evaluate the current status of the material legal risks to the Covestro Group at
the end of each reporting period. The need to recognized or adjust a provision and the amount of the provision or
adjustment are determined on this basis. Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of preparation of the
consolidated financial statements.
See note 26 “Legal Risks.”
Personnel-related provisions are mainly those recorded for variable one-time payments, individual performance
awards, long-service awards, severance payments in connection with early retirement arrangements, surpluses
on long-term accounts, and other personnel costs. Since January 1, 2022, calculation of the provision for short-
term variable compensation (“Covestro Profit Sharing Plan”, “Covestro PSP”) has been based not only on the
achievement of financial performance indicators such as Earnings Before Interest , Taxes, Depreciation and
Amortization (EBITDA), Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF), and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
above Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), but also on a sustainability component measured on the basis
of selected environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. In fiscal 2022, measurement was based on
selected environmental criteria.
Obligations under share-based compensation programs that provide for awards payable in cash are also
included in personnel-related provisions (“Prisma”). The compensation of the Board of Management of
Covestro AG and of managerial employees includes cash compensation based on the share price that are
earned with lock-up periods and are reflected in profit or loss as personnel expenses in line with the
consideration paid in the performance period. They are measured using a subscription price model at the time of
granting and at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment). In 2021, Prisma was
expanded to include a sustainability component that covers Covestro’s target for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions (CO equivalents, CO e).
2 2
Miscellaneous provisions include those for other liabilities, for product liability, for warranty, and insurance
payments. Rebates to be granted to customers, on the other hand are reported under refund liabilities.
253 Covestro Annual Report 2022
CAPITAL MARKET MANAGEMENT REPORT COMPENSATION REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION
Other Receivables and Liabilities
Other receivables are measured at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
the asset.
Pending Transactions
Pending transactions relating to contributions in kind (“executory contracts”), i.e., agreements in relation to which
(to a degree) neither the service nor the consideration has been rendered, are not recognized in the statement of
financial position on the reporting date if there is no risk of a loss on the reporting date. If there is the risk of a loss,
this is generally anticipated in the form of provisions if all the other requirements are met. In contrast, gains
anticipated from such agreements on the reporting date may not be recognized in the statement of financial
position. Examples of executory procurement contracts include contracts regarding the procurement of energy
for the operation of production facilities, which also includes what are known as power purchase agreements
(PPA) for the procurement of power from renewable energy. In comparison, pending transactions in the area of
the application of the rules regarding financial instruments (financial derivatives) are to be recognized on the
reporting date in the amount of the negative fair value if a loss is expected and in the amount of the positive fair
value if a gain is expected.


The image is a diagram of a corporate risk management system, detailing the structure and flow of responsibilities within an organization. The system is layered to show different levels of oversight and operational functions related to risk management. Here is a breakdown of each level:

1. **Supervisory Board / Audit Committee**:
   - At the top, responsible for monitoring the risk management processes. This ensures oversight and accountability.

2. **Board of Management**:
   - Directly below the Supervisory Board/Audit Committee, this layer has overall responsibility for handling material risks and opportunities within the group. It also ensures the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system.

3. **Corporate Risk Committee**:
   - This committee ensures a holistic overview of the organization’s risk landscape. It functions under the Board of Management to aggregate and assess risk information from various parts of the organization.

4. **Corporate Risk Management**:
   - Positioned below the Corporate Risk Committee, this level is responsible for the creation and implementation of risk management guidelines and software. It also handles communication and reporting, process-integrated monitoring, and provides guidance on risk management.

5. **Sub-committees with Risk Owners**:
   - At the operational level, these sub-committees are involved in the hands-on management of risks. They perform functions such as risk identification, evaluation, and handling, ensuring that risks are managed effectively on the ground level.

6. **Corporate Audit**:
   - Shown at the base of the diagram, operating independently from the risk management processes to ensure unbiased monitoring of the entire risk management system.

The diagram uses arrows to indicate the flow of information and responsibility, emphasizing a comprehensive and structured approach to risk management that integrates oversight, management, and execution across different levels of the organization.
