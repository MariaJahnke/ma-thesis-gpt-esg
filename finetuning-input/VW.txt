 3 FOCUS TOPICS STRUCTURE AND TASKS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY ORGANIZATIONSustainability means maintaining intact environmental , social and economic systems with long-term viability at global , regional and local level . The Volkswagen Group can in/f.narrowluence these systems in various ways and actively takes responsibility to make a contri-bution to preserving their sustainability . An extensive sustainability management system was set up for this purpose . The related structures , processes and responsibilities are codi/f.narrowied in a speci/f.narrowic Group policy . We view sustainability management as a continu-ous improvement process.The Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG has cross-functional overall responsibility for sustainability . Additional responsibility is taken by members of the Board of Management with their responsibility for speci/f.narrowic management systems relating to sustainability and by the Group Steering Committee for Sustain-ability . The members of this steering committee include managers from central Board of Management business areas and Group func-tions , representatives of the brands and the Group Works Council . The steering committee de/f.narrowines concrete strategic targets and pro-grams , sets out measures for uniform cross-business-area , cross-brand and cross-regional development of sustainability manage-ment and makes decisions on sustainability-related basic issues and positions in the Volkswagen Group . In addition , topic-speci/f.narrowic questions on sustainability are addressed in Group initiative 6 of the NEW AUTO Group strategy .

  Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights verted into impact points . This makes the absolute environmental impacts comparable with one another and means we can im-plement reduction measures targeted precisely at the areas where greatest impact can be achieved.• We use the site checklist to continuously review the implementa-tion status of 143 prede/f.narrowined environmental criteria that can not be easily quanti/f.narrowied . Examples of this include speci/f.narrowic projects for retaining biodiversity , creating conditions for environmentally friendly employee mobility or measures for promoting the circular economy.In the 2022 reporting year , we achieved an important milestone on the way to the Zero Impact Factory . The Production Group Committee con/f.narrowirmed the visionary aim of “ Zero Impact ” for 2050 as well as the measurement methods and management tools developed for this . The aim is to record and reduce the absolute environmental impact , particularly in the areas for action of climate protection and energy , emissions , water and waste . However , the focus will also be on qualitative aspects such as the appearance of the factory , commit-ment to biodiversity , protection of soil , avoidance of operational ANCHORING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN MANUFACTURING : ZERO IMPACT FACTORYWe are planning the production of tomorrow with our one.PRO-DUCTION Group production strategy . The program included participatory events , talks by experts , and many digital work-shops and information programs on the topics of decarbonization , energy , environmental compliance , biodiversity , water , waste and circular economy.We have been presenting the Zero Impact Factory Award to recog-nize particularly innovative environmental projects and increase awareness of the  The /f.narrowirst line comprises the operational risk management and in-ternal control systems at the Group companies and business units . The RMS and ICS is an integral part of the Volkswagen Group ’ s structure and work/f.narrowlows . Incidents that could constitute a risk are /f.narrowirst identi/f.narrowied and then assessed on the basis of multiple criteria with regard to the likelihood of occurrence , /f.narrowinancial loss and reputa-tional damage and the potential threat to adherence to external legal requirements . Countermeasures are introduced , the remaining potential impact is assessed , and the information incorporated into the planning in a timely manner . Material risks are reported to the relevant committees on an ad-hoc basis . The results of the operational risk management process are incorporated into budget planning and /f.narrowinancial control on an ongoing basis . The targets agreed in the budget planning rounds are continually reviewed in revolving plan-ning updates . At the same time , the results of risk mitigation mea-sures are promptly incorporated into the monthly forecasts regard-ing further business development . This means that the Board of Management also has access to an overall picture of the current risk situation via the documented reporting channels during the year.The second line is the Group risk management organization , which , among other things , sets standards for the RMS/ICS , provides support to the divisions in the form of relevant training and coordinates the quarterly risk survey . It reports quarterly to the Group Board of Management on any material risks , which are de/f.narrowined using quan-titative and qualitative assessment criteria and given probability ratings . The additional annual governance , risk and compliance ( GRC ) control process , with a focus on internal control activities , will be gradually replaced by a standardized ICS by 2025 . In the stan-dardized ICS , standardized control targets are now set for the key Group companies to cover process risks . The documented control activities are regularly tested for their effectiveness and the ICS is thus improved.The third line of defense is Group Internal Audit , which carries out regular checks on the structure and implementation of the RMS and ICS as part of its independent audit activities.The Volkswagen Group continuously develops its risk management in order to take account of constantly increasing internal and ex-ternal requirements in the /f.narrowield of corporate responsibility.RISKS RELATING TO THE FOCUS ISSUESRisks relating to our focus issues are taken into account in both the methodology and the content of our RMS and ICS . The standardized ICS uses master control catalogs . These contain standardized process risks and associated control targets as a speci/f.narrowication for internal controls to be carried out in the Group companies . Risks and require-ments in relation to product or environmental compliance are ad-dressed in various master control catalogs , e.g. , for production . We check whether the master control catalogs are up to date each year and adjust them if necessary . In the quarterly risk process , the risks are classi/f.narrowied into risk clusters . 33 SUSTAINABILITY IN THE GROUP ’ S DNA Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights The focus areas are addressed in both the master control catalogs in the standardized ICS and the risk clusters of the quarterly risk process . For example , the content of the focus issue of decarboniza-tion is taken into account in the environment and sustainability master control catalog via the risk that “ the material environmen-tal and sustainability risks of our products , production and ser-vices along the entire life cycle are not/insuf/f.narrowiciently identi/f.narrowied. ” In the compliance master control catalog , the risk that “ compliance breaches and risks ( whistleblower information ) are not addressed or not suf/f.narrowiciently addressed or not promptly/correctly dealt with ” serves to take account of the focus issue of integrity . As part of the quarterly risk process , risk clusters involving environmental risks , emission risks , compliance risks or CO₂ risks , or product-related risks , for example , that address these focus issues are speci/f.narrowied.Risks that could impact on our bottom line also include general en-vironmental risks and climate-change risks . These include risks that could result from different CO₂ and emissions regulations , but also extreme weather , storms or /f.narrowloods with effects on production , infrastructure and supply chains . The risks relevant from the Volkswagen Group ’ s perspective are presented in the report on risks and opportunities in the Group management report . In /f.narrowiscal year 2022 , risks continued to be identi/f.narrowied with regard to compli-ance with regulations on /f.narrowleet CO₂ emissions in individual brands and markets that may result in charges for the Volkswagen Group . A more detailed description is available in the report on risks and opportunities in the Annual Report under the heading “ En-vironmental Protection Regulations. ” Further risks can arise from the assertion of what are actually civil-law environmental policy objectives.The Volkswagen Group produces CO₂ emissions with its business and products . We wish to make our contribution to limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius in accordance with the Paris Agreement by making our entire Group net carbon neutral by 2050 . To this end , decarbonization has been /f.narrowirmly anchored as a focus area in the NEW AUTO Group strategy . More information on the effects , targets and measures can be found in the Decarboniza-tion chapter . DecarbonizationIn addition , no further material risks within the meaning of section 289c ( 3 ) no . 4 of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB ) relating to the focus issues have been identi/f.narrowied . 2022 Annual Report > Group Management Report > Report on Risks and Opportunities 34 SUSTAINABILITY IN THE GROUP ’ S DNA Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights Degreed , the innovative learning platform that we have established , will open up a wide range of further training opportunities for our employees . The platform creates a simple , individual learning expe-rience and will be progressively rolled out in the Group . Degreed is aimed at supporting the results of strategic HR planning with appro-priate training programs . Another focus is developing important skills – for example , in areas such as data analytics , software devel-opment , leadership , machine learning and arti/f.narrowicial intelligence . The “ Individual career orientation ” ( ICO ) module offers all Volkswagen AG employees the opportunity to re/f.narrowlect on career goals , interests and personal skills and compare these with the development opportuni-ties in the Group . Various methods of self-re/f.narrowlection or assessment by others , practical exercises , literature recommendations and pod-casts are also offered in a toolkit.In our extensive training measures , we set store by an overarching system and uniform standards . This also applies to the leadership and management programs we currently use , which are summa-rized in the following overview.Program Participating brands and companies¹ Target audienceForeman base training ( FBT ) The FBT teaches the basic skills necessary for performing the work of a foreman . The participants optimize the management of their own foremanship , are strengthened in their foreman role and expand their leadership skills . They experience their own behavior in real management situations and learn to re/f.narrowlect on themselves even better . VW AG , MAN Truck & BusForemanManager base training ( MBT ) In the MBT , participants get to know the relevant management tools and successfully use them situationally within Volkswagen AG ’ s value system . The MBT also includes content on re/f.narrowlection on your own management style.VW AG Subsection managerManagement development programThe management development program for prospective managers focuses on diversity , business management and personal responsibility .

That is why we conduct the Opinion Survey each year . In this employee survey , in which 159 companies of the Group took part in 2022 , we measure the status of our internal employer attractiveness with a targeted question . In addition , we are also interested in our employees ’ views on the questions of where the Group stands on the topic of integrity and how they assess working relationships in the Group . The results of the Opinion Survey help us to identify possible improvements and inform managers of where action needs to be taken in their organizational units . In de/f.narrowined follow-up processes , managers take suitable measures in dialog with their employees . The Opinion Survey ’ s Group team supports them in this with various tools/uni00A0– such as a method toolbox.¹ To improve readability , subsidiaries and microenterprises have not been mentioned.GRI 404-2 80 PEOPLE IN THE TRANSFORMATION Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights The regular communication with managers on the measures de-rived and their implementation status takes place using a top-down approach , beginning with the respective division manager/Board member and proceeding to the lowest management level . The aim is to ensure the implementation of the measures derived from the organizational units in a lasting manner.In 2022 , the survey covered 159 companies in 49 countries . Of the 614,142 employees in the companies surveyed , 475,778 participated . This is equivalent to a response rate of 77 % . The employee satisfac-tion index , which is calculated from 22 questions , is the principal indicator of the Opinion Survey . It is calculated from the total of all the related answers in the survey and , in 2022 , stood at 82.4 out of a possible total of 100 index points in the Volkswagen Group ( 2021 : 82.3 index points ) and at 76.2 index points in Volkswagen AG ( 2021 : 76.2 index points ) . The result of the employee satisfaction index in/f.narrowluences the level of the annual bonus as part of the vari-able remuneration for the Board of Management.In 2022 , the score on the employee satisfaction index in the Volkswagen Group was82.4 out of 100 possible index points and thus slightly above the score in the previous year.Successfully Contributing Their Own IdeasThrough their creativity , knowledge and initiative , employees take on responsibility for improving processes and products and ulti-mately help us to achieve our sustainability goals . In 2022 , 13,953 ideas were submitted as part of idea management , and savings of around €38 million were achieved at Volkswagen AG ’ s sites . In addition , Volkswagen AG supports the development of business ideas /f.narrowit for the future with its own separate innovation fund . The associated “ intrapreneurship ” program offers employees the oppor-tunity to implement their own business ideas at Volkswagen and expand the existing portfolio of services and products . It consists of an incubator phase for developing a business plan and an accel-erator phase for constructing prototypes and customer tests . Under an agreement between IG Metall and Volkswagen AG , the Group makes €20 million available to the fund each year for projects in new areas of business./two.LinProp .  In the course of this , the Volkswagen Group Academy established a training portfolio on agility.In order to actively support divisions , departments and project teams with implementing strategic realignments , the Culture & Change Factory was founded at Volkswagen in 2021 . This area , which is under the umbrella of the Group Academy , supports and steers various transformation projects with around 40 experts . The team ’ s exper-tise includes change management , culture change , agile training , coaching , process design and continuing training./three.LinProp . INITIATIVES IN THE ALL OF US @ VOLKSWAGEN DIMENSIONThe Volkswagen Group Essentials de/f.narrowine the shared underlying values across all of the Group ’ s brands and companies . Seven simple “ We ” statements describe what the Group stands for : “ We take on responsibility for the environment and society , ” “ We are honest and speak up when something is wrong , ” “ We break new ground , ” “ We live diversity , ” “ We are proud of the work we do , ” “ We not me , ” “ We keep our word. ” We want our corporate culture to create a feeling of belonging for our workforce – a feeling that increases in importance in particular in times of change and in an environment that is becoming increas-ingly diverse . We see fair remuneration as an important part of our self-image . It is intended to motivate and express our appreciation for the performance of each individual . And last but not least , we need to empower our leaders to contribute to a successful transfor-mation and act as role models . Leading by Example As a ManagerRole models motivate , give people courage for change and create trust . These are key factors for successfully working together . The role model program supports managers in strengthening these fac-tors . Concise catalogs give managers suggestions and instructions for different activities that can be implemented easily and without any additional budget . The binding framework with minimum requirements for managers supports implementation of this pro-gram to improve the corporate culture.Social Compatibility of the Transformation in FocusCollective job security agreements play an important role in the transformation . In Volkswagen AG in Germany , the job security ap-plies until 2029 as a result of the Digital Transformation Roadmap , which underlines our appreciation for industrial work . We also strive to act in a socially responsible way anywhere we have to cut jobs for economic reasons . For example , as it did many other companies , the coronavirus pandemic also challenged Volkswagen do Brasil to reduce /f.narrowixed costs . Volkswagen do Brasil , metalworker trade unions and employee representatives of all four plants came together to negotiate a restructuring agreement . In addition to cost-cutting , it was also a matter of applying /f.narrowlexibility mea-sures and adjusting the headcount through a program of volun-tary resignations.At MAN Truck & Bus SE , partial retirement contracts , termination agreements , a change of Group and the establishment of a transfer company were used as tools for the socially responsible headcount reduction that was also necessary there . The basis for this was the negotiation of a joint key issues paper between the company ’ s man-agement and the employee representatives . The corresponding rules and programs that were implemented in 2021 continue to ap-ply until 2023.We provide the HR answers to various challenges at a national or international level with future-proo/f.narrowing programs that we have concluded as part of codetermination . For example , Germany and other parts of Western Europe face not only risks resulting from demographic changes but continue to face shortages of skilled workers who we will need for cutting-edge areas of work . Fair and Transparent PayA fair and transparent pay system and payment of fair remunera-tion make a signi/f.narrowicant contribution to employees ’ work satisfac-tion . In accordance with our Social Charter , the remuneration and fringe bene/f.narrowits for our employees correspond at least to the legally required minimum level which is to be guaranteed in the particular country . As they are collectively agreed with trade unions , our rates of pay are usually higher than the prevailing minimum levels . Our employees are generally selected , hired and promoted on the basis of their quali/f.narrowications , experience and abilities . Individual pay is generally based on the job performed.GRI 404-2 82 PEOPLE IN THE TRANSFORMATION Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights GRI 2-23 , 2-24T/four.LinPropI Initiatives and Packages of measures The T4I packages of measures are grouped in 11 core initiatives:1 ) HR compliance policies and procedures : I & C is integrated into standard HR processes such as recruitment , training , promotion and remuneration . It is also a compulsory topic in annual employ-ee appraisals and is part of training measures for employees . Volkswagen/uni00A0AG and other de/f.narrowined companies keep anonymized statistics on misconduct and the resulting sanctions . These are regularly communicated to employees.2 ) Code of Conduct : The Code of Conduct ( CoC ) lays the foundations for compliance in the Volkswagen Group . It acts as the key element for reinforcing awareness of responsible conduct and decision- making within the workforce , providing help , and /f.narrowinding the right contact persons in cases of doubt . The CoC is a component of the Group ’ s employment contracts and is mandatory for all the Group ’ s employees . The CoC is also part of employee appraisals as a measurement criterion for “ setting an example of integrity and compliance. ” 3 ) Integrity program : The integrity program aims to anchor integri-ty as a strategic success lever and a control variable for deci-sion-making processes . The objective is to communicate the im-portance of integrity to employees , to support them in acting with integrity in their day-to-day work and to make integrity visi-ble and tangible . The most important tools included dialog-orient-ed communication measures , event formats and so-called integ-rity ambassadors , who carry the topic into the structures of the Group and promote dialog . One focus of the program is raising awareness of making decisions with integrity . Speci/f.narrowic training modules for all levels of manage-ment , including foremen , have been developed for this . These are in-tegrated into all Volkswagen AG ’ s obligatory management training programs . Brands and companies that do not use these programs are required to include corresponding modules in their own development programs.4 ) Risk management and internal control processes : Binding struc-tures and processes are intended to create transparency and help manage risk from our business activities . These include the quar-terly risk process , which is focused on acute risks , the standard internal control system ( ICS ) , which is intended to protect key processes , business continuity management , which identi/f.narrowies business-critical processes and protects them with contingency plans , and root cause analysis.5 ) Internal compliance risk assessment ( ICRA ) and compliance orga-nization : The ICRA determines the compliance risks in the Group . Based on their risk pro/f.narrowile , measures are de/f.narrowined for each company and their implementation is tracked . The ICRA also de/f.narrowines im-plementation standards for the CoC , the whistleblower system , compliance training and communication . The Group Chief Com-pliance Of/f.narrowicer reports to the K-VAC on an ad hoc basis , but at least annually , on the implementation status of the measures . In the reporting period , the ICRA process was brought into line with the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltsp/f.narrowlichtengesetz ) . These changes will be applied in 2023.6 ) Whistleblower system : The whistleblower system is the central point of contact for reporting cases of rule-breaking by Group employees , direct and indirect suppliers , and selected other business partners . These include , for example , economic crimes , corrup-tion , tax offenses and breaches of the CoC . A detailed description of the whistleblower system follows on p. 101 . 7 ) M & A and NCS compliance : In the case of planned mergers and acquisitions ( M & A ) requiring the involvement of the Compliance team , the companies and transactions are audited for human rights risks and for integrity and reputation risks , including corruption , money laundering and fraud – for example , in a due diligence . This also applies to joint ventures , industrialization projects such as the construction of new foreign production sites with external partners , and collaborations with third parties . The business units are then given recommendations for risk-reducing measures . Furthermore , Group Compliance deals with compliance manage-ment at noncontrolled shareholdings ( NCSs ) , i.e. , companies that are not controlled by a Volkswagen Group company as a majority shareholder . This also includes the Chinese joint ventures . 8 ) Business partner due diligence : The business partner due dili-gence process reviews the integrity of business partners and sup-pliers on the procurement side and the sales side , particularly for corruption risks . This also encompasses constantly monitoring the business partners for whether they are complying with laws and ethical standards.9 ) Product compliance : The product compliance management sys-tem ( PCMS ) supports our products in meeting the statutory and regulatory requirements of the exporting and importing coun-tries , internal and external standards , contractually agreed cus-tomer requirements and externally communicated commit-ments over their entire service life . The PCMS de/f.narrowines roles and responsibilities for design , implementation and monitoring . We train employees and managers on product compliance and have central points of contact to which our employees can address their questions.10 ) Environmental compliance : The Group ’ s environmental policy and the environmental compliance management system stipu-late that environmentally relevant aspects and requirements must be taken into account in all strategy , planning and deci-sion-making processes of the brands and Group companies . This includes a KPI system that measures progress on environmen-tal targets . Environmental Compliance Management97 INTEGRITY Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights 11 ) Anti-corruption : The Volkswagen Group has a zero-tolerance policy toward active or passive corruption . This is anchored in both the Code of Conduct for Employees and in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners . Further Group policies set out how to deal with con/f.narrowlicts of interest , donations and sponsor-ship or bene/f.narrowits in the form of gifts or invitations . In addition , there are operating guidelines addressing approval procedures , record-keeping and appropriate behavior . Reported breaches of the code are pursued and investigated by managers and HR , and in serious cases also by our investigation of/f.narrowices . If personal misconduct is found , the HR department in question takes the appropriate disciplinary action . Further Increasing the Measurability of IntegrityIn addition to the perception workshops , the annual employee survey – the Opinion Survey – in particular provides information about the progress of our culture of integrity . The Group-wide survey includes a question on whether it is possible for each indi-vidual to act with integrity . If employees have any doubts about this , the relevant manager needs to identify and clear possible ob-stacles together with their team . The brands that manufacture passenger cars use the “ compliance , culture of dealing openly with mistakes and acting with integrity ” strategic indicator as an additional metric . This is also based on the Opinion Survey and asks about compliance with regulations and processes , dealing with risks and errors , and whether it is possible to act with integrity . The key performance indicator has continuously improved through to 2022 from an already good starting point : since compilation of this indicator began , employee agreement has always been in the highest category of the underlying /f.narrowive-point scale . COMPLIANCE : CLEAR RULES IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUPSustainable economic success can only be achieved if each individ-ual complies with laws , internal regulations and voluntary com-mitments . Compliant behavior should be a matter of course for all Group employees . The compliance organization provides support through programs , guidelines for action , processes and practical advice in the Group-wide , risk-oriented compliance management system ( CMS ) .COMPLIANCE ORGANIZATION : ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE GROUPGroup Compliance supports the Group and brand companies in carrying out their business activities in compliance with the rules and complying with the relevant laws and internal regulations . Focuses of the work include anti-corruption and preventing embez-zlement , fraud and money laundering . In addition , the Compliance department and Group Legal must be included in M & A transac-tions , which includes joint ventures , industrialization projects and cooperation projects with external partners . Group Legal also conducts risk assessments on antitrust and anti-competitive risks in relevant Group departments and companies.The Group Chief Compliance Of/f.narrowicer heads the global compliance organization . They report directly to the member of the Board of Management for Integrity and Legal Affairs and to the Audit Com-mittee of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG . The compliance organization is structured by division , which is intended to strengthen communication and enable harmonized processes across all relevant Group companies.The divisional compliance of/f.narrowicers are generally responsible for several brands and implement compliance measures in their area of responsibility . Porsche AG and Traton SE are exceptions from this . They have their own , independent compliance structure .   Supply Chain and Human Rights COMPLIANCE ALONG OUR SUPPLY CHAINCLEAR STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS– Code of Conduct– Business partner due diligenceTRAINING AND OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES– Mandatory , regular CoC training for all employees– Target-group-speci/f_ic training ( e.g. , anti-corruption , antitrust , compliance ) – Compliance information pointDATA PROTECTION– Data protection management system ( DPMS ) including reporting process– Data protection management organization EXTERNAL REPORTING CHANNELOmbudsmen ( external attorneys ) WHISTLEBLOWERSInternal or external REPORTING CHANNELS IN THE VW GROUPOnline reporting channel , 24/7 hotline , email , mail , in personWHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM : Business partners , employees , customers and other third parties can report information on potential breaches of the rules at any time and/uni00A0in many languages . Extensive Compliance and Anti-Corruption Training Group Compliance has implemented structures and measures to establish Group-wide , uniform standards for compliance training through the compliance management system – for example , on the/uni00A0Code of Conduct , on anti-corruption , the prohibition of money laundering and the whistleblower system . Implementation packages for the rollout of mandatory training describe the key aspects of the training in terms of content and process . These will enable brands and companies to train employees in a risk-based , target-group- speci/f.narrowic manner with de/f.narrowined core content and hold training courses of equal quality . Members of senior management and above are certi/f.narrowied on the CoC each year . They con/f.narrowirm that they comply with the requirements of knowing their own role of setting an example of compliance , raising the awareness of employees in their area of responsibility accordingly and giving them access to the CoC . Knowledge of the obligation to report serious breaches of regulations and the disclosure of any con/f.narrowlicts of interest are also part of the certi/f.narrowication . Business partners and contractors from sales and pro-curement also receive training based on risk . The basis for this is the CoC for Business Partners . This has been a component of agree-ments with suppliers and service providers since 2020 . Across the Group , all employees are required to complete regular CoC training in accordance with uniform standards . It ensures basic awareness of integrity and compliance . The content of the training – including business and human rights , environmental compliance , product conformity , product safety , and occupational safety – is up-dated every two years . The next update will follow in 2023 . The brands and companies regularly provide changing supplementary focus content from the Code of Conduct.Here , employees have to complete the training and /f.narrowinal test in the form of a web-based training ( WBT ) and repeat it every two years . Passing is documented in their training history . Interns , student workers and doctoral candidates are excluded from the training for technical and process reasons . Production employees receive mandatory CoC training every four years . Volkswagen AG systemically records the number of permanent staff ( employees and management , including full-time and part-time staff ) who are required to take mandatory training and have a valid quali/f.narrowication from the web-based training on the CoC . In Volkswagen AG , 48,311 employees in the relevant target group had a valid CoC quali/f.narrowication as of the end of December 2022 . This is equivalent to 98.4 % of the permanent staff at Volkswagen AG who must be trained using the web-based training on the CoC.In addition , Group Compliance develops and implements target-group- speci/f.narrowic training for employees in areas or companies with high risk exposure . Anti-corruption training with an in-depth module on dealing with of/f.narrowiceholders and mandate holders is mandatory for employees . Companies with high risk exposure must implement this training on a mandatory basis . Managers from senior manage-ment upwards also have their awareness raised regarding the parts of the CoC containing the prohibition on corruption as part of the annual certi/f.narrowication on the CoC.The number of permanent staff who are required to take mandatory training and have a valid quali/f.narrowication is systematically recorded for the mandatory web-based training on the topic of anti-corrup-tion – for example , in Volkswagen AG . In Volkswagen AG , 45,808 employees in the relevant target group had the relevant valid quali-/f.narrowication as of December 31 , 2022 . This equates to 93.0 % of the permanent workforce ( employees and management ) to be trained , including full-time and part-time employees . The practical “ Anti- corruption ” guidelines can also be accessed at any time.Group Legal introduced new web-based antitrust training in 2022 . Depending on risk exposure , its completion may be mandatory . Group Legal also continuously provides antitrust training on a risk-based basis . The Group Board of Management is also trained on its content . In addition , employees who are employed in key positions with high risk exposure receive additional compliance training . This concerns , for example , managing directors or /f.narrowinancial of/f.narrowicers . This training is held across the Group by the respective companies ’ compliance and personnel managers . In addition to the training , Volkswagen AG ’ s compliance depart-ments offer target-group-speci/f.narrowic training formats and communi-cation formats , including management discussions and training courses for disseminators of information . Moreover , compliance content is a component of all career development paths , from the trainee induction program through programs for leadership and management development to the senior management program . The measures are supplemented by information and communication activities such as awareness campaigns , /f.narrowilm and dialog formats , newsletters and interactive games . GRI 2-24 , 205-2 100 INTEGRITY Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights Communication and Advice : Options for EmployeesThe compliance information point has established itself as a central advisory of/f.narrowice . It can be contacted in person , in the Volkswagen 360° app or by email . The team is responsible for speci/f.narrowic compliance ques-tions – for example , on sponsorships , memberships and collabora-tions and on questions relating to HR and labor law – interprets in-ternal company guidelines and policies , and advises on process standards . If no direct recommendation is possible , the query will be passed on to a competent body . Dialog events in the departments supplement the services offered . Tasks and example cases from the practice of the advisory work are regularly included in compliance communication . The aim is to provide employees with concrete recommendations for future , similar questions and improve the internal control system.In the reporting year , the information point handled 1,517 inquiries ( previous year : 1,335 , in each case Volkswagen AG ) . Around 18 % re-late to the acceptance or giving of gifts and invitations . Where gifts have been received that , for example , exceed value limits , and these can not be given back – for instance , for cultural reasons – it is possi-ble to hand these in to Compliance . The gifts collected in the past few years were sold at auction in the reporting year . The proceeds of around €10,200 Euro were donated to a non-pro/f.narrowit climate and environmental protection association.Data protectionTo meet the requirements of the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) , Volkswagen AG has created a data protection management system ( DPMS ) and a data protection management organization . The DPMS ensures that the data protection processes set up are regularly analyzed , are up to date and are further developed . One component of the DPMS is the process for reporting data protec-tion violations ( reporting process ) . It is connected with Volkswagen AG ’ s whistleblower system and IT Security . In /f.narrowiscal year 2022 , there were no reportable data protection breaches pursuant to Art . 33 EU GDPR in the processing of personal customer data . In addition , reportable data protection breaches outside of the processing of personal customer data were also reported to the competent super-visory authority in due time . In accordance with Group policy , Group companies are responsible for their own compliance with the applicable data protection requirements.Risk Prevention through the Whistleblower SystemThe whistleblower system is intended to avert damage to the Group , the workforce and other stakeholders with binding principles and regulated procedures . Employees , business partners and their em-ployees , customers and other third parties can report information on potential breaches of the rules at any time – including anonymously if they so choose . The whistleblower system offers six different report-ing channels for this . These include an online channel , which accepts reports in many languages ; an international 24-hour telephone hot-line ; and external attorneys , who act as ombudsmen . The processing of the reports and any follow-up questions can also be con/f.narrowidential and anonymous , if this is requested . Special IT infrastructure pre-vents the source of the information from being identi/f.narrowied . Strict con/f.narrowidentiality and secrecy apply throughout the investiga-tion process . An investigation is only initiated after a thorough review and in the event of concrete indications of rule-breaking . There is a presumption of innocence . Those involved are heard as soon as possible , and their names are cleared if they have been wrongly accused . Sanctions are applied where misconduct is proven . This can comprise a warning , a reprimand or termination . Following serious breaches of rules , structured root cause analyses are conducted in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.The Central Investigation Of/f.narrowice in Wolfsburg coordinates the Group-wide whistleblower system . The employees there process whistle-blower information concerning Volkswagen AG and those of its subsidiaries that do not have their own investigation of/f.narrowice and also process reports with relevance for the Volkswagen Group.Group Internal Audit , Group Security and Group Legal assist with operational case investigation . In individual cases , the investigation of/f.narrowice also commissions investigations by independent and external third parties , such as law /f.narrowirms or auditors . This may occur espe-cially when the information concerns members of the Board of Management or cases are exceptionally complex – particularly with imminent legal consequences for Volkswagen AG ( e.g. , in the event of particularly serious corruption or possible breaches of antitrust and anti-competitive law ) . AUDI AG , Porsche AG and TRATON SE each have separate investi-gation of/f.narrowices for themselves and their subsidiaries . There is also a regional investigation of/f.narrowice at Volkswagen ( China ) Investment Company Ltd . It processes whistleblower information concerning Volkswagen AG ’ s Chinese subsidiaries . Cooperation between the in-vestigation of/f.narrowices and uniform processing of whistleblower infor-mation are centrally monitored and coordinated in Wolfsburg.An IT system , internal controls and multiple-party veri/f.narrowication sup-port employees with the processing of suspicious activity reports . Figures on the whistleblower system are reported to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board at regular intervals . The workforce is also regularly informed about the whistleblower system . In addition , numerous compliance training courses address the task of the whistleblower system and how it works . Employees who might frequently come into contact with serious breaches of rules due to their work receive in-depth training . This includes , for example , employees in the /f.narrowields of audit , security , human resources , legal or compliance.GRI 2-26 101 INTEGRITY Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights The Volkswagen Group assures all whistleblowers and people who support the whistleblowers or the investigations of protection from any reprisals they could experience due to their reports and their efforts to investigate breaches . This is anchored in Group policy 3 , which applies worldwide , and is described in the Code of Conduct . The terms stated in the Group policy show that the Volkswagen Group complies with the provisions of international whistleblower protection laws – for example , the EU directive on whistleblower protection , its implementation acts and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( LkSG ) . To prepare for the entry into force of these new legal regulations , the Central Investigation Of/f.narrowice has carried out an information campaign to raise awareness in the relevant Group companies . Breaches of the ban on discrimination are treated as serious breaches of the rules.Within the digital ComplianceXChange workshop format , the whistleblower system team communicates with experts from other DAX companies twice a year to share experiences and discuss current issues.Suspected Cases and Compliance Breaches in the Reporting YearIn 2022 , the investigation of/f.narrowices registered 3,073 whistleblower reports ( 2021 : 3,219 ) . Around 24 % of these were anonymous but with the option to contact the whistleblower , and around 9 % were anonymous without the option to make contact . In 754 cases , the Central Investigation Of/f.narrowice accepted an initial suspicion of breaches of the Code of Conduct , in several cases also of laws and/or speci/f.narrowic internal regulations at the same time , with the result that an inter-nal investigation was initiated . Of these , 187 cases involved poten-tially serious breaches of rules.In the reporting year , the investigation of/f.narrowices investigated individual cases of suspected serious infringements of rules to prevent corrup-tion . In six cases this resulted in signi/f.narrowicant sanctions such as warn-ings or dismissals . In /f.narrowive cases this was due to violations of rules to avoid con/f.narrowlicts of interest and in one case to a violation of pro-curement guidelines . Five investigations into suspicions of serious infringements of antitrust or competition law were closed . In none of these cases was a serious violation of antitrust or competition law established.An independent external auditor regularly audits the effectiveness and functionality of the whistleblower system . The audit is currently conducted annually . The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board , the Group Board of Management and the boards of manage-ment of companies concerned are informed of the result and possi-ble suggestions for improvement . The past audit showed that the Group whistleblower system ’ s processes are suitable for ef/f.narrowiciently and effectively processing whistleblower information . In the reporting year , the investigation of/f.narrowices of AUDI AG , Traton SE , Porsche AG and Volkswagen AG were audited.GRI 205-3 , 418-1 102 INTEGRITY Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights INTEGRITY KPIS KPIUnit20222021Notes and commentsT4I T4I rollout in controlled companiesnumber784707Since the start of the program Approval rate from T4I perception workshopsin % 87.882.7De/f.narrowinition , see p. 96Information point Inquiries processed to the compliance information pointnumber1,5171,335Volkswagen/uni00A0AG Change in inquiries processed to the compliance information point in % 14–10Code of Conduct Employees of Volkswagen AG who have a valid quali/f.narrowication on the Code of Conductnumber48,31148,017Web-based training ; scope de/f.narrowinition , see p. 100 Proportion of the workforce of Volkswagen AG to be quali/f.narrowied in % 98.498.2Web-based training ; scope de/f.narrowinition , see p. 100Anti-corruption Employees of Volkswagen AG who have a valid quali/f.narrowication on the topic of anti-corruptionnumber45,80836,565Web-based training ; scope de/f.narrowinition , see p. 100 Proportion of the workforce of Volkswagen AG to be quali/f.narrowied on the topic of anti-corruption in % 93.074.8Web-based training ; scope de/f.narrowinition , see p. 100Pieces of whistleblower information Pieces of whistleblower informationnumber3,0733,219In all investigation of/f.narrowices of which anonymous and without any possibility of contactin % 910BPDD reviewsnumber > 4,300 > 8,600Business partners in sales and procurement ( suppliers ) Culture of rules Compliance , a culture of dealing openly with mistakes and acting with integrity86.686.3GRI 205-2 103 INTEGRITY Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights Supply Chain Grievance Mechanism The supply chain grievance mechanism is used to process informa-tion on human-rights and environmental risks and on breaches of human-rights or environmental obligations by the Volkswagen Group ’ s direct or indirect suppliers.The mechanism is accessible via the channels of the Volkswagen Group ’ s whistleblower system and is open to all potentially affected stakeholders – e.g. , employees of suppliers , civil society players or representatives of communities in the immediate vicinity of our production locations . The processing of cases is uniformly de-scribed in a binding manual and is managed by the Group . Cases are processed together with the brands and regions of the Volkswagen Group . Breaches identi/f.narrowied are categorized by their severity to ensure adequate processing . Depending on the categorization of the breach , appropriate measures are then introduced . If there are serious breaches , it is possible to temporarily block suppliers from eligibility for the award of new contracts or to terminate the busi-ness relationship with them.Media ScreeningGroup Procurement Sustainability carries out continuous and risk-based media screening of relevant suppliers² using a software tool . If the tool identi/f.narrowies indications of possible breaches of our Code of Conduct for Business Partners , these are reviewed and , if necessary , processed in the supply chain grievance mechanism . Sustainability RatingA sustainability rating ( S rating ) was introduced in 2019 as a key measure for all relevant companies and suppliers with a high sus-tainability risk . The S rating is used to audit the sustainability per-formance of relevant suppliers³ and reveal opportunities for con-tinuous improvement . It assesses the environmental performance of suppliers and their social sustainability and integrity . The S rating is directly relevant to awarding contracts : If a supplier does not meet our requirements for compliance with sustainability standards , it is fundamentally not eligible for the award of contracts . There is thus a direct incentive for suppliers to improve their sustainability performance.SUSTAINABILITY RATINGThe S rating is a Group-wide tool used to assess the sustainability performance of relevant suppliers³ in the /f_ields of the environment , social and integrity and to mitigate risks . It is directly relevant to awarding contracts . • Standard measures : These proactive and reactive measures in-clude the Code of Conduct for Business Partners , the supply chain grievance mechanism , media screenings , the sustainability rating and training suppliers and employees . • Deep Dive measures : These encompass the human rights focus system in the supply chain , the raw material due diligence man-agement system and collaboration with external partners to develop the concept of sustainability in the supply chain.Implementation of the management approach is mandatory and is enshrined in corresponding policies for the Group ’ s brands and controlled companies . The Volkswagen Group identi/f.narrowies the sus-tainability risks that may arise as a result of its business relation-ships . The processes for analyzing risk represent the /f.narrowirst step of our ReSC system . Based on the risks identi/f.narrowied , a package of mea-sures for preventing and mitigating risks is assigned to the suppli-ers in the respective business models and countries.STANDARD MEASURES : FOUNDATION OF OUR RESC SYSTEMCode of Conduct for Business PartnersThe core element of our supplier management is the “ Volkswagen requirements for sustainability in relations with business part-ners ” /uni00A0– the Code of Conduct for Business Partners . It sets out our expectations of our business partners ’ conduct with respect to key human-rights , environmental , social and compliance standards . The requirements are based , among other things , on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the relevant International Labour Organization ( ILO ) conventions . The Code of Conduct is , however , not just based on international standards , but also objectives , rules and policies of the Volkswagen Group.Before submitting a quote , our suppliers must con/f.narrowirm that they accept our sustainability requirements in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners . They must consent to this again after 12 months if they wish to submit new quotes . We also call on our tier 1 suppliers to pass our requirements set out in the Code of Conduct for Business Partners down along the supply chain . In 2022 , the Code of Conduct was revised and the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( LkSG ) were added . In addition to the Code of Conduct for Business Partners , there are additional product-speci/f.narrowic require-ments for suppliers . These are set out in the speci/f.narrowications and stipulate the way in which certain products must be manufactured . The requirements include , for example , achieving full disclosure of the cobalt supply chain for battery cells . These requirements are also binding for the suppliers in question . ² The relevance of a supplier for media screening results from factors including the procurement volume or the risk exposure derived from the type of product or service . ³ The relevance of a supplier for the S rating results from factors including the size of the company or the risk exposure derived from the type of product or service.GRI 2-23 , 2-24 , 2-25 108 SUPPLY CHAIN AND HUMAN RIGHTS Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights Sustainability Training for Employees and SuppliersSystematic training of our employees and suppliers is a central component of our strategy and essential for the improvement of sustainability in the supply chain . For all Procurement employees , the topic of sustainability is an established part of the skills pro/f.narrowile . The training course on sustain-ability for procurement was taken more than 2,000 times in total worldwide in 2022 . Our training measures continue to also be geared to speci/f.narrowic target groups . For example , buyers of components asso-ciated with higher sustainability risks were given an intensive training program in a separate format . Since 2017 , we have trained our Procurement employees to deal with the special challenges found in battery supply chains . In 2022 , more than 2,900 suppliers were trained on sustainability globally.In order to facilitate continuous supplier development , we usually conduct issue-speci/f.narrowic sustainability training courses and workshops with our suppliers at selected locations or online and offer web-based training . More than 2,900 suppliers were trained accordingly in the reporting period . This includes 245 suppliers who use the Drive Sustainability initiative ’ s online training and e-learning op-tions.⁴ Voluntary , in-depth human rights training for suppliers has been available since 2020 and was run again in 2022.In addition to the trainings , we make an e-learning module on sus-tainability available to current suppliers in nine languages . DEEP DIVE MEASURES : FURTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR RESC SYSTEM Human Rights Focus SystemIn our sustainable supply management , we are also involved in protecting groups of people who may be subject to a high risk of potential human rights violations at any point in our supply chain . We implemented a human rights focus system ( HRFS ) in 2022 to comply with international frameworks and requirements and speci/f.narrowically the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( LkSG ) . The system aims to identify particularly high risks in our supply chain in connection with human rights violations and the environment and to manage these appropriately . To this end , we evaluated aggregated data from our supply chain grievance mechanism , the on-site checks and information from studies , NGO reports and stakeholder conversations in the reporting year in order to draw up a long list of relevant topics . For 2023 , we plan to use this to The check for the S rating takes place via a multistage process . In an initial step , the risk exposure is identi/f.narrowied from a combination of country risk and the supplier ’ s corporate processes and policies . In addition , the companies ’ sustainability performance is checked in on-site spot checks . A specialist service provider is used for the identi/f.narrowication of the country risk . We check whether suppliers ’ corporate processes and guidelines meet our requirements by means of a standardized questionnaire for self-assessment . We developed the self-assessment questionnaire ( SAQ ) in a joint project with other automotive corpora-tions involved in the DRIVE Sustainability Working Group organized by CSR Europe . Relevant topics were added to the SAQ to prepare for the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( LkSG ) . The information and documents in the SAQ are checked and validated by a service provider via a central platform : If a supplier states that it has appro-priate processes and guidelines , it must prove this with documents . Every supplier that the S rating applies to must meet the requirements enshrined in the questionnaire in the areas of corporate governance , the environment , social issues , human rights , compliance and supplier management . Since this reporting year , selected questions in the SAQ have been considered mandatory as minimum require-ments for all suppliers from a site size of ten employees . As of this year , proof of a certi/f.narrowied and/or validated environmental manage-ment system is also mandatory for all suppliers with a production site and a site size of 100 employees or more . Suppliers in the scope who do not have an existing environmental management certi/f.narrowicate may submit a letter of commitment pledging the completion of certi/f.narrowication in the near future during a transition phase . A supplier is not eligible for the award of contracts unless it meets the mini-mum requirements . In addition , suppliers who we have identi/f.narrowied as having an increased corruption risk due to their business and region are also subjected to a more in-depth corruption risk audit . This process is called the business partner due diligence ( BPDD ) process and is carried out before any decision to award a contract . In addition , all relevant business partners will then also be continuously checked for any change in general conditions through risk and news screening . There were a total of 487 business partner due diligence reviews in the reporting year.We are also working continuously on avoiding duplication when auditing and , to achieve broader coverage of the supply chain , are partnering with original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) and sup-pliers in a German Association of the Automotive Industry ( VDA ) task force to create a common standard for on-site audits . To this end , major Volkswagen Group companies founded the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative e.V . in 2021 together with 11 additional partners , and this initiative continued to grow in the reporting year . First pilot projects of the on-site-check standard were run in connec-tion with this in 2022 . ⁴ Change in methodology : scope expansion for training in 2022.109 SUPPLY CHAIN AND HUMAN RIGHTS Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights Increasing transparency is an important prerequisite for identifying , avoiding and mitigating human rights risks in the upstream supply chain . To this end , the Volkswagen Group works closely with its direct suppliers and business partners in the context of the raw material due diligence management system.We cooperate with , among others , service providers who enable suppliers to be comprehensively audited using arti/f.narrowicial intelligence . Here , permanent real-time monitoring of freely available internet sources , including social media , provides us with indications of possible breaches by suppliers.Because the human-rights-related risks are often highest at the start of the supply chain and these can be countered most effectively here , direct collaboration with mine operators on the certi/f.narrowication of mines is an additional part of our strategy . In this way , we intend to audit , assess and improve the sustainability performance of the mines in our supply chain in the medium term . Collaboration with External Partners and Involvement in International InitiativesIn addition to close collaboration with our direct and indirect sup-pliers , we get involved in initiatives and local projects to address human rights risks in the upstream supply chain and beyond our contractual relationships . These cross-industry and , in some cases , raw-material-speci/f.narrowic initiatives are listed in our Responsible Raw Materials Report . The aims of collaboration with partners in the automotive industry and along the value chain include knowledge transfer , the development of standardized tools for risk assessment and the introduction of standards for responsible raw material supply chains with respect to human rights , the environment and compliance.In the reporting year , the Volkswagen Group and its brands joined additional important initiatives . For example , Volkswagen AG has been a member of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance ( IRMA ) since February 2022 . IRMA is a multi-stakeholder alliance that advocates for high standards in mining . The IRMA standards encompass the protection of human rights and the rights of local communities , the exclusion of corruption , health protection mea-sures , occupational safety , and environmental protection . In the re-porting year , the Volkswagen Group also became a member of the Leather Working Group . Porsche joined the Responsible Mica Initia-tive in 2022.decide on focus activities , which will then be addressed during the year . A toolbox of measures will be developed to address these focus topics . This will be used from 2023 for mitigating the risks identi/f.narrowied . Raw Material Due Diligence Management SystemWith regard to the responsible sourcing of raw materials , the Volkswagen Group implements the /f.narrowive steps of the OECD Due Dili-gence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and the require-ments of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Con/f.narrowlict-Affected and High-Risk Areas . In 2020 , we implemented an OECD-oriented raw material due diligence management system . It serves to identify , assess and avoid actual and potential human rights risks in our upstream raw material supply chains and currently encompasses 16 particularly risky raw materials . These include the battery raw materials cobalt , lithium , nickel and graphite , the con/f.narrowlict minerals tin , tungsten , tantalum and gold ( 3TG ) , and aluminum , copper , leather , mica , steel , natural rubber , platinum group metals and rare earths.⁵ With this risk-based approach , we prioritize our activities on the basis of the severity and probability of breaches of the law and on the basis of the Group ’ s in/f.narrowluence . We also systematically use our Group structure for developing and implementing speci/f.narrowic prevention and mitigation measures , whose effectiveness we audit . New report structures and toolkits have been developed and existing tools , such as the supply chain grievance mechanism , have been integrated in/uni00A0the management system . Depending on the results of the due diligence process , the measures are adapted and improved on an ongoing basis.Since 2021 , the Volkswagen Group has also reported on the obser-vation of its human rights due diligence obligations in the raw material supply chain – including reporting on the status , progress and goals of the raw material due diligence management system – in an annual Responsible Raw Materials Report . The Group ’ s speci/f.narrowic activities and measures regarding the 16 particularly risky raw materials are also set out there . www.volkswagenag.com > Sustainability > Reporting & ESG Performance > Sustainability Report ⁵ The risk scope of the management system goes beyond Annex 2 of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Con/f_lict-Aﬀected and High-Risk Areas . 110 SUPPLY CHAIN AND HUMAN RIGHTS Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENTS AMONG OUR SUPPLIERS A total of more than 16,029 active suppliers⁶ completed an SAQ in connection with the S rating . In the reporting period , 6,748 suppliers improved their sustainability performance through taking appro-priate steps . Based on sales revenue , more than 85 % of our suppliers with a production site and a site size of 100 employees or more have documented that they have a certi/f.narrowied environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 or validation in accordance with EMAS or a letter of commitment.⁷Following an initial analysis of the supplier data , in-depth audits are carried out on-site , based on risk . 252 on-site audits were carried out worldwide in 2022 . On average , six breaches of our sustainability re-quirements were identi/f.narrowied.⁸ Differences can be seen depending on the region.By the end of the reporting year , we had 12,660 S ratings for suppliers , accounting for around 75 % of total procurement expenditure . Of these suppliers , 6,618 have an A rating . 65 suppliers were rated C and are thus not currently eligible for the award of contracts . Suppliers who do not meet our requirements for compliance with our sus-tainability standards are also not eligible for the award of contracts . 6,618 suppliers have an A rating.In the reporting period , 145 reports of breaches from the supply chain grievance mechanism were dealt with . In total , four suppliers were blocked from eligibility for the award of new contracts due to seri-ous breaches.For battery raw materials , especially cobalt , we pursue the objective of creating supply chain transparency from mining the raw materi-als to manufacturing the /f.narrowinished product . We have been passing the requirement for full transparency on to our direct battery sup-pliers in our contracts since 2020 . Volkswagen has the data received audited and veri/f.narrowied by partner companies through second-party supply chain mapping audits . In the Cobalt for Development project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , we work together with partners for improved working and living conditions for small-scale cobalt miners and their communities . The pilot project aims to strengthen compliance with laws and improve health and safety conditions and social well-being for people locally . Additional in-formation is available on the project website . Cobalt for Development ( C4D ) For the battery raw material lithium , the Volkswagen Group , to-gether with other partners , has created the Responsible Lithium Partnership initiative , which works towards responsible use of re-sources and sustainable lithium production in Salar de Atacama in Chile . This is to be achieved through a multi-stakeholder platform comprising all the relevant players in the Salar watershed – from civil society groups , including indigenous communities , through government institutions to local mining companies.Beyond raw material activities , our involvement in the industry-led initiative DRIVE Sustainability under the umbrella of CSR Europe remains key . The development of the common questionnaire stan-dard for auditing sustainability aspects of suppliers was a mile-stone in this respect , as was the training approach for suppliers pursued jointly with other OEMs via training events in selected countries.GRI 308-2 , 414-2 ⁶ Change in methodology : in 2021 , active SAQs from suppliers without revenue were also taken into account.⁷ Change in methodology : Scope in the previous year took account of production sites of suppliers of production material ( direct material ) . In this reporting year , the production sites of suppli-ers of general material ( indirect material ) were also taken into account.⁸ Scope : excluding on-site checks at logistics service providers.111 SUPPLY CHAIN AND HUMAN RIGHTS Table of Contents The Group ’ s DNA | Decarbonization | Circular Economy | People in the Transformation | Diversity | Integrity | Supply Chain and Human Rights
