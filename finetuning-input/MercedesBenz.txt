### Title and Header
- **B.36**: This appears to be a reference or section number from a larger document.
- **The Compliance Management System**: This serves as the heading of the flowchart, clearly indicating the subject matter.

### Core Elements of the Compliance Management System
The flowchart is divided into seven main components that outline the structure and process of the compliance management system:

1. **I. Compliance Values**:
   - Positioned at the top, this is the foundational element of the CMS. It represents the core principles and ethical standards that guide the organization's compliance efforts.

2. **II. Compliance Objectives**:
   - Directly flows from the Compliance Values, indicating that the objectives of the CMS are derived from these foundational values.

3. **III. Compliance Organization**:
   - This component is about the structural setup of the compliance team or department within the organization, detailing how it is organized to meet compliance objectives.

4. **IV. Compliance Risks**:
   - Identifies potential compliance-related risks that the organization might face, suggesting a proactive approach to risk management.

5. **V. Compliance Programme**:
   - Details the specific programs and policies implemented to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and internal standards.

6. **VI. Communication & Training**:
   - Focuses on how the organization communicates its compliance policies internally and how it trains employees to adhere to these policies, ensuring they are well-informed and equipped to comply.

7. **VII. Monitoring & Improvement**:
   - The final component, indicating a continuous process where the CMS is regularly monitored for effectiveness and improved based on findings and evolving compliance needs.

### Flow of Information
The arrows show a clear flow of information and dependency:
- Starting from Compliance Values, branching out to Objectives and Organization, and flowing into Risk identification.
- From Risk identification, the flow moves into specific Compliance Programs, which are supported through Communication and Training.
- Finally, all efforts are under constant Monitoring and Improvement to close the loop, ensuring ongoing refinement and responsiveness of the CMS.

This structure underscores a comprehensive and systematic approach to compliance, highlighting the organization's commitment to maintaining high ethical and legal standards across its operations.
