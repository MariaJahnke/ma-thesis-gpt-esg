SAP Integrated Report 2022

The Work of the Supervisory Board Committees
The committees made a key contribution to the work of the Supervisory Board in 2022, notably by
preparing relevant agenda items and resolutions for Supervisory Board meetings and by regularly
reporting on their deliberations in general and on their decisions taken. The following committees
were in place in the year under review:
– Personnel and Governance Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, Finance and
Investment Committee, Technology and Strategy Committee, People and Culture
Committee, Nomination Committee, Go-To-Market and Operations Committee
Each of the aforementioned committees was active in 2022. For more information about the
Supervisory Board committees, particularly their respective composition, tasks, and responsibilities,
see the Corporate Governance Statement and the Corporate Governance section of SAP’s Web site.
Besides the matters described above, the committees focused primarily on the following topics in
2022:
– The Personnel and Governance Committee held four regular meetings in the reporting year. In
particular, the Committee, in fulfillment of the tasks assigned to it, extensively prepared and
discussed in advance the deliberations of the Supervisory Board and its resolutions on the new
Executive Board compensation system. It also approved two loans for officers of SAP who hold
procura powers. At its meeting in February, it did preparatory work on the Supervisory Board’s
proposal to the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders with respect to the adjustment of
Supervisory Board compensation. It also deliberated on the draft Supervisory Board report for the
financial year 2021, SAP’s competitive position, and the Executive Board’s customer relationship
management (CRM) strategy. When the Committee met in April 2022, it reviewed the composition
of the Supervisory Board committees that was envisaged after the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders on May 18, 2022. On July 27, 2022, the Committee conducted its regular review of
pension payments made to former Executive Board members and deliberated on the creation of a
formalized process for the feedback of the Supervisory Board vis-à-vis Executive Board members.
In addition, it updated the target number of women on the Executive Board and the diversity
concept. It was resolved that SAP should voluntarily keep to its target of having two women on the
Executive Board. The Committee additionally dealt, at both its April and July meetings, with the
search for a successor to SAP’s CFO Luka Mucic, who would be leaving the Company in
March 2023. Even between meetings, the Committee members were in continual contact with the
23/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
personnel consulting firm that had been enlisted for this purpose, and conducted interviews of
potential candidates. The Committee chairperson reported on the status of the candidate search in
the meetings of the full Supervisory Board. Finally, in August, the Committee initiated the proposed
resolution by the full Supervisory Board on the appointment of the new CFO. The focus of the
October 2022 meeting was once again the aforementioned feedback process and its
implementation. In addition, the Committee deliberated on the process for cultivating and
shortlisting internal talents who were considered potential successors to Executive Board positions.
– The Audit and Compliance Committee held 11 regular meetings in 2022 – two of which jointly with
the Finance and Investment Committee and one jointly with the Technology and Strategy
Committee. Said schedule included one short telephone conference per quarter to vote on the
quarterly reporting, and one session per quarter to address regular and topical agenda items. In its
meetings, the Committee also had the opportunity to engage with the auditor without the Executive
Board present, which was an integral part of the meeting agenda. The Committee comprehensively
prepared the resolutions of the Supervisory Board for all topics assigned to it, as described above.
Regular agenda items included the course of business in the respective quarter, the accounting
processes, the preparation of end-of-quarter closings, and the quarterly reports due for publication.
In addition, the (new) Committee chairperson was in regular contact with the auditor. Other
recurring meeting topics included the monitoring of SAP’s risk management system, internal control
system, and compliance system (including specific compliance issues, the status of corresponding
SAP-internal investigations, and case-related collaboration with authorities), and cybersecurity. In
its February 2022 meeting, the Committee prepared the Supervisory Board’s resolutions on the
financial statements of SAP SE and the Group for 2021 in the run-up to the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders, which were adopted at the audit meeting. Other material topics dealt
with by the Committee beyond the regular meeting topics in its ordinary meetings and those
described in the “Sustainability” section of this report included quarter-specific matters and the
compensation system for SAP’s Sales organization. Further, the Committee monitored the progress
of selected lawsuits involving SAP. The Audit and Compliance Committee also received regular
updates on activities relating to the change in auditor for SAP’s financial statements and
consolidated financial statements, particularly progress reports on the onboarding of the new
auditor. In addition, the Committee continually monitored the quality of the current and future
auditor and the management report. To this end – in addition to evaluating satisfaction surveys for
the previous year’s audit by the current auditor – the Committee obtained and referred to regular
reports from the auditor on its internal quality assurance standards and to any material findings
from internal quality audits, external quality controls, and peer reviews, and from any investigations
conducted by the government or regulators into the auditor's audits. The Committee discussed the
audit focus for 2022 with the auditor at its meeting in July. As reported in more detail below, the
Committee also held two joint meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee in February
and December 2022 to discuss the Group annual plan for 2022 and the preliminary Group annual
plan for 2023. The joint meeting with the Technology and Strategy Committee in July focused on
the results of the assessment by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, a
department of the U.S. Department of Commerce) and the progress of certain internal audits. The
auditor attended all Audit and Compliance Committee meetings except for the joint meetings with
the Finance and Investment Committee and the Technology and Strategy Committee, and reported
in depth on its audit work and on its quarterly reviews of selected software and cloud agreements.
– The Finance and Investment Committee held six regular meetings and five extraordinary meetings
in 2022, and outside these meetings it passed two resolutions by correspondence. It held a joint
meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in February and again in December 2022, and
a joint meeting with the Technology and Strategy Committee in December 2022 as described in
more detail below. In an extraordinary meeting in January 2022, the Committee approved the
acquisition of a minority interest in Icertis, a contract lifecycle management specialist based in the
United States. It also discussed the planned acquisition of Taulia, an American working capital
management firm, at length and ultimately resolved to recommend the acquisition to the
Supervisory Board. In the joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in
24/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
February 2022, the members of both Committees discussed the annual budget for 2022 and voted
in favor of recommending its approval to the Supervisory Board. At the Finance and Investment
Committee meeting on the same day, the new head of the Investor Relations team introduced
himself, provided an overview of the core topics in his remit, and presented his strategic concept.
When it met in April, the Committee and the Executive Board discussed selected investor relations
and capital market topics, strategic business plans for various product areas, plans for future
collaboration with SAP partners, and potential divestments. The Executive Board also reported on
the major investments planned and on its analysis of employee efficiency. During the Committee’s
first meeting in July, it deliberated on the sale of the Litmos business as described above. At its
second meeting in July, the Committee dealt with Investor Relations matters and engaged in a
detailed discussion about the efficiency of SAP’s development organization. The Executive Board
also presented its new strategy for investing in the venture capital sector in collaboration with the
Sapphire Ventures team. After extensive consultation, the Committee resolved to recommend that
the Supervisory Board approve the set-up of a new fund for direct investments totaling
US$1.25 billion and a further venture capital fund for fund-of-funds investments totaling
US$100 million. The Committee also resolved, by way of correspondence, to recommend the
Supervisory Board’s consent to a share buy-back program worth €500 million and approved the
extension of existing bilateral bank loans. In the October meeting, the Executive Board updated the
Committee on investor relations and treasury topics, explained its plans to streamline the portfolio,
and presented its regular report on the success of the Company's recent acquisitions. Beyond this,
the Committee and the Executive Board discussed management efficiency and competency, and
examined process optimizations in the cloud. In addition, the Committee reviewed its own activities
and the format of its meetings, with a view to good corporate governance. At its two extraordinary
meetings held on December 12 and 13, 2022, the Committee was apprised of planned
improvements to selected business areas and drafted a resolution to recommit funds previously
dedicated in July 2022 for Sapphire Ventures fund-of funds activities. In December 2022, the
Committee held a second joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee, at which the
Executive Board presented the preliminary Group annual plan for 2023. This meeting was held in
preparation for the Supervisory Board meeting in February 2023, at which the full Supervisory
Board resolved to approve the Group annual plan for 2023.
– The Technology and Strategy Committee held six meetings in 2022, which included one joint
meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee and one joint meeting with the Finance and
Investment Committee. The Committee discussed the outlook for key technology trends in the
software industry in the years to come and SAP’s corporate and product strategies. The Executive
Board explained SAP’s midmarket and customer experience strategies to the Committee members
at its February meeting, where the two bodies also discussed the specific requirements resulting
from the rapid growth and expansion of medium-sized customers. In April, the Committee turned
its attention to artificial intelligence and “data to value” – the act of deriving business value from
data – placing particular focus on the integration of data sources in compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements. In July 2022, the Executive Board updated the Committee on the strategic
plans for process intelligence and automation and explained how SAP Signavio solutions would be
used to expand SAP’s opportunities in the business process optimization space. At the joint
meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee, also in July, the Committee was updated on
progress in the areas of enterprise vulnerability management and asset management. When it met
in October 2022, the Committee examined SAP’s innovation strategy as regards business
transformation, business network, and sustainability. At their joint meeting in December, the
Technology and Strategy Committee and the Finance and Investment Committee deliberated on
the efficiency of SAP’s development organization and were given an overview of SAP’s current
development processes and tools by the Executive Board.
– The People and Culture Committee met five times in the reporting year. The focus of its February
meeting was on strategic personnel planning as relate to the “the future of work” concept and the
evolution of skills. The Committee was presented in this regard with a detailed overview of the past
and expected demographic development of the SAP SE workforce, and discussed the skills and
25/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
expertise the Company would require of employees in the future. In addition, the global head of
Diversity and Inclusion introduced herself to the Committee, following which the Committee looked
at the career development of employees in expert functions and discussed the refining of SAP’s
leadership culture introduced the year before. Performance management was a key topic of the
July meeting, where an initiative to promote appreciation and respect at the Company was
presented. The Committee then reviewed the progress made in this initiative and the feedback
received from employees in this connection at its October meeting, where it also looked at
investments in headcount and the compensation budgets for 2023. The Committee held an
extraordinary meeting in November where it and the Executive Board looked in-depth at the talent
development process the Company was pursuing in the SAP S/4HANA area. The two bodies
addressed three specific aspects in this regard: improving the quality of the recruitment process,
training and upskilling staff, and promoting the performance culture at SAP.
– The Nomination Committee met four times in 2022. In February 2022, it deliberated on proposed
successors for the departing Supervisory Board member Bernard Liautaud. Following
corresponding interviews and careful evaluation of the competencies of all persons under
consideration, it resolved the nomination of Jennifer Li as further candidate for election to the
Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2022. The Committee came to the
conclusion that Jennifer Li had the best qualifications to succeed Bernard Liautaud and that her
other mandates outside SAP would not prevent her from performing her duties as a member of the
Supervisory Board and making valuable contributions to the work of the SAP Supervisory Board.
The Committee also met on July 27, 2022, where it discussed succession planning on the
Supervisory Board, particularly for the position of chairperson, and agreed that the search for
suitable candidates should continue to be conducted both within SAP and outside the Company.
As in the past, the Committee enlisted the help of a renowned personnel consulting firm for this
purpose. In its meeting on October 27, 2022, the Committee members discussed the status of the
candidate search and the initial results submitted to it by the consulting firm. At the Committee’s
meeting in December, the personnel consultant presented a short list of candidates, which the
Committee discussed in depth before deliberating on the next steps in the search.
– The Go-To-Market and Operations Committee likewise met four times in the reporting year. At the
February meeting, the Committee was informed of the cloud revenues generated in 2022 versus
the year before, apprised of the current cloud backlog growth, and presented with the Executive
Board’s current strategy to accelerate growth in the cloud. In April, the Executive Board presented a
new strategy for technology and sales that addressed how SAP would position its technologies in
the market going forward and the role SAP Business Technology Platform would play in this. In
July, the Committee was updated on SAP’s competitive situation and, based on this information,
discussed with the Executive Board what strategic decisions would result from this. The two bodies
then deliberated on how SAP cloud solutions could be run more efficiently in key strategic
business areas. The October meeting focused on the transformation of the Cloud Success Services
(CSS) area, which had been triggered at the beginning of 2021. The core of this transformation was
the merger of various user departments into one CSS unit that supported SAP’s cloud portfolio.
The Executive Board first explained how this measure was intended to ensure end-to-end
customer relationships that focused on customer success and customer lifetime value. It then
presented the Committee with the CSS targets and the Company’s plans for expanding the
organization further. The Committee also examined how SAP’s partner ecosystem evolved with the
shift to the cloud. The business update included a discussion about how SAP would react in the
event of interruptions to its energy supply. The Executive Board explained to the Committee how
SAP was currently protecting its data centers and for which scenarios the Company was preparing
itself, including in the case of hyperscalers and their server systems, which would likewise be
affected by energy bottlenecks.
The work of the committees and their regular reports to the full Supervisory Board ensured that we
were kept fully informed of all matters covered by the committees and were able to discuss them
thoroughly.

Conflicts of Interest
Members of the Supervisory Board and of the Executive Board had no conflicts of interest that
recommendations E.1 and E.2 of the GCGC require to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board. Insofar
as Supervisory Board members hold executive positions in companies or have material equity in
companies that currently have business dealings with SAP, we do not see any impairment of their
independence. The scope of these transactions is relatively small and, moreover, takes place at arm’s
length.
Training and Professional Development
The members of the Supervisory Board were once again offered various training and professional
development opportunities throughout the year, with appropriate support from the Company. On-
boarding sessions and leaflets are available for new Supervisory Board members to familiarize
themselves with their tasks and responsibilities when they assume office. Where it made sense,
presentations and training offerings were recorded and placed on a specially configured training
platform to enable the remaining Supervisory Board members to take part in them as well. The
members of the Audit and Compliance Committee were invited to short seminars in April 2022 on
“New EU reporting requirements for sustainability” (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), and
on the “OECD/G20 New World Tax Order for Digital Business” (a basic approach adopted by
OECD/G20 to reform international business taxation). An external expert attending the Supervisory
Board’s meeting in October provided a general overview of the importance of sustainability for
companies and the expectation of investors where this was concerned. In December 2022, external
experts held an information session for members of the Supervisory Board on the future legal
framework in the area of ESG and its relevance for the work of the Supervisory Board.
SAP SE and Consolidated Financial Reports for 2022
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin (KPMG) audited the SAP SE and consolidated
financial reports for 2022. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders elected KPMG as the SAP SE
and SAP Group auditor on May 18, 2022. The Supervisory Board proposed the appointment of KPMG
on the recommendation of the Audit and Compliance Committee. Prior to the proposed resolution
being put to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, KPMG had confirmed to the chairperson of
the Supervisory Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee that circumstances did not exist that
might prejudice or raise any doubt concerning its independence as the Company’s auditor. In that
connection, KPMG informed us of the volume of the services that were not part of the audit which it
had either provided to the Group in the past year or was engaged to provide in the year to come. The
Supervisory Board has agreed with KPMG that the auditor should report to the Supervisory Board and
record in the auditor’s report any fact found during the audit that is inconsistent with the declaration
given by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board concerning implementation of the German
Corporate Governance Code. KPMG examined the SAP SE financial statements prepared in
accordance with the German Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as required by the German
Commercial Code, section 315e, and the combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report
prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code, and certified them without qualification.
The auditor thus confirmed that, in its opinion and based on its audit in accordance with the
applicable accounting principles, the SAP SE and consolidated financial statements give a true and
fair view of the net assets, financial position, and results of operations of SAP SE and the SAP Group.
The auditor also confirmed that the combined SAP SE and SAP Group management report is
consistent with the corresponding financial statements and as a whole gives a suitable view of the
position of SAP SE and the SAP Group and of foreseeable opportunities and risks. In accordance with
section 317 (3a) of the German Commercial Code, the auditor also examined and confirmed that the
renderings of the financial statements, the management report, the consolidated financial statements,
and the combined management report contained in the files submitted on an electronic data carrier,
which can be accessed by the issuer on the secure client portal, and prepared for the purposes of
27/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
disclosure comply in all material respects with the requirements of section 328 (1) of the German
Commercial Code regarding the electronic reporting format (“ESEF format”). KPMG had completed its
audit of SAP’s internal control over financial reporting and certified without qualification that it
complies with the applicable U.S. standards. The auditor stated in its opinion that it considers SAP's
internal controls with respect to the consolidated financial statements to be effective in all material
respects. Additionally, it provided assurance on the non-financial declaration and the disclosures
contained therein on the topics identified as material – namely, the environment, employees, human
rights, corruption and bribery, customer loyalty, and data privacy and data security – in the combined
management report, and on the separate review of the compensation report and selected qualitative
and quantitative sustainability disclosures outside of the financial statements and management report.
All Audit and Compliance Committee members and Supervisory Board members received – initially in
the form of drafts that were identical to the final documents – the documents concerning the financial
statements mentioned above, the audit reports prepared by KPMG, and the Executive Board’s
proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings in good time. On February 22, 2023, the
Executive Board prepared the financial accounts of SAP SE and the Group for 2022, comprising the
SAP SE financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management
report, and submitted them without delay to the Supervisory Board.
The Executive Board explained the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group and its
proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings at the meeting of the Audit and
Compliance Committee on February 22, 2023 (based on the drafts identical to the final documents)
and at the meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 22, 2023. Members of the Executive Board
answered questions from the Committee and the Supervisory Board. At the Audit and Compliance
Committee meeting, they also explained the compensation report and the Annual Report on Form 20-
F prepared in accordance with the applicable U.S. standards.
After the Executive Board had explained them, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the
Supervisory Board reviewed the financial statement documents (based on drafts identical to the final
documents), taking KPMG’s audit reports (or the drafts identical to the final documents) into account.
The Audit and Compliance Committee then passed the compensation report on to the Supervisory
Board for release. The representative of the auditor who attended presented full reports on the audit
and the results of the audit to the Audit and Compliance Committee and Supervisory Board meetings
and explained its audit reports (or final drafts thereof). The auditor also reported that it had not
identified any material weaknesses in SAP’s internal control and risk-management systems for
financial reporting. Both the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board asked
detailed questions about the form, scope, and results of the audit. The Audit and Compliance
Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on its own review of the financial statements of SAP SE
and the SAP Group, its discussions with the Executive Board and with the auditor, and its supervision
of the financial reporting process. It confirmed that, as part of its supervisory work, it had addressed
the SAP Group’s internal control, risk management, and internal auditing systems, and found the
systems to be effective.
The Committee also reported that KPMG had told it that no circumstances had arisen that might give
cause for concern about KPMG’s impartiality, and informed us about the services KPMG had provided
that were not part of the audit. The Committee reported that it had examined the auditor's
independence, taking the non-audit services it had rendered into consideration, and stated that, in the
Committee’s opinion, the auditor possessed the required degree of independence and professional
qualification.
The Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board satisfied themselves that KPMG
had conducted the audit properly. In particular, they concluded that both the audit reports and the
audit itself fulfilled the legal requirements. On the basis of the report and the Audit and Compliance
Committee’s recommendation, the Supervisory Board approved the results of the audit and, since
there were no findings from our own examination, we gave our consent to the SAP SE financial
statements, the consolidated financial statements, the combined Group management report, and
adopted the compensation report pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, section 162. The
28/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
financial statements and combined management report were thus formally adopted upon approval by
the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board’s opinion of the Company and the Group coincided
with that of the Executive Board as set out in the combined management report. The Supervisory
Board considered the proposal presented by the Executive Board concerning the appropriation of
retained earnings. We had regard to the requirements of dividends policy, the effects on the liquidity of
SAP SE and the SAP Group, and the interests of the shareholders. We also discussed these matters
with the auditor. We then endorsed the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of
retained earnings, in accordance with the Audit and Compliance Committee's recommendation. The
corporate governance statement pursuant to the German Commercial Code, sections 315d and 289f
was approved for publication by the Supervisory Board by way of correspondence vote prior to the
meeting to discuss the financial statements. Finally, we adopted this present Report.
Changes on the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in 2022
There were no changes on our Executive Board in 2022. The appointment of the new CFO as
described above will only come into effect in 2023.
The Supervisory Board bade farewell in 2022 to Bernard Liautaud who, after 14 years as a member,
resigned from his position with effect from the closing of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
on May 18, 2022. The Supervisory Board thanks Bernard Liautaud for his commitment to SAP. On
May 18, 2022, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders elected Jennifer Li to the Supervisory
Board as his successor.
In addition to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we now face major challenges from the war in
Ukraine and its humanitarian, geopolitical, and economic implications. The Supervisory Board thanks
the members of the Executive Board and all SAP employees for their tireless commitment to SAP
under these extraordinary circumstances.

Independent Assurance
Practitioner's Report
To the Supervisory Board of SAP SE, Walldorf
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement of SAP SE
(further “Company” or “SAP”) and on the non-financial statement of the parent company that is
combined with it, which are published in the Management Report, (further “combined non-financial
statement”) for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022.
Responsibilities of Management
Management of the company is responsible for the preparation of the combined non-financial
statement in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB
[“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of June 18, 2020 on establishing a framework
to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the "EU
Taxonomy Regulation") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own
interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated
acts adopted thereunder as set out in section “Sustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures” of the
combined non-financial statement.
This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting
methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the
group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, management is responsible for such
internal control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a combined non-financial
statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms
that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not
yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU
Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section “Sustainable Finance:
EU Taxonomy Disclosures” of the combined non-financial statement. They are responsible for the
defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be
interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.
Independence and Quality Assurance of the Assurance
Practitioner’s firm
We have complied with the independence and quality assurance requirements set out in the national
legal provisions and professional pronouncements, in particular the Professional Code for German
Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the
German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance
requirements in audit practice (IDW QS 1).
Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the combined non-financial
statement based on our assurance engagement.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of
41/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Historical Financial Information" issued by the IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform
the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our
attention that cause us to believe that the company's non-financial statement, is not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the
EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by
management disclosed in section “Sustainable Finance: EU Taxonomy Disclosures” of the combined
non-financial statement. We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure.
In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable
assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The
selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the assurance
practitioner.
In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following
assurance procedures and other activities:
– Interviewing employees responsible for the materiality analysis at group level in order to obtain an
understanding on the approach for identifying key issues and related reporting limits of SAP,
– Carrying out a risk assessment, inclusive of media analysis, on relevant information on
sustainability performance of SAP in the reporting period,
– Assessing the design and implementation of systems and processes for identifying, handling, and
monitoring information on environmental, employee and social matters, human rights and
combating corruption and bribery, including the consolidation of data,
– Interviewing staff on group level, who are responsible for the disclosures on concepts, due
diligence processes, results and risks, the performance of internal control activities and the
consolidation of the disclosures,
– Inspecting selected internal and external documents,
– Analytically assessing the data and trends of the quantitative information, which is reported on
group level of all locations,
– Evaluating the local data collection, validation, and reporting processes as well as the reliability of
the reported data by means of a sampling survey at two locations,
– Interviewing of responsible staff on group level to obtain an understanding of the approach to
identify relevant economic activities in accordance with the EU taxonomy,
– Evaluating the design and implementation of systems and procedures for identifying, processing,
and monitoring information on turnover, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for the
taxonomy-relevant economic activities for the first two environmental objectives climate change
mitigation and climate change adaptation,
– Evaluating the data collection, validation, and reporting processes, as well as the reliability of the
reported data for the taxonomy-aligned economic activities in conjunction with the assessment of
the technical evaluation criteria for the substantial contribution, the fulfilment of the DNSH-criteria
and the documentation of the minimum safeguard,
– Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures.
In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation,
management is required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined
legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly,
our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.

Including Information on
Sustainable Activities
With this section and the information referenced to in this section, SAP SE fulfills its duty to produce a
non-financial statement (NFS) for the holding company, pursuant to section 289b–e of the German
Commercial Code (HGB), and a non-financial group statement, pursuant to section 315b–c in
conjunction with section 289c–e of the German Commercial Code (HGB), in the form of a combined
non-financial statement. The relevant non-financial matters are referenced in the table below and can
be found in the relevant sections of our combined management report.
Additionally, following Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of the European Union (EU Taxonomy), we have included information on how and to what extent
SAP’s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable
under this regulation.
For more information, see the EU Taxonomy Disclosures subsection.
Reporting Framework
The social and environmental data and information included in the SAP Integrated Report have been
prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.
Business Model
SAP’s business model is described in the Strategy and Business Model section of the combined
management report. Good governance is a prerequisite for continued success and is described
throughout the combined management report. Therefore, we did not include governance as an
individual material topic in our materiality assessment and our non-financial statement.

The criteria for Taxonomy-alignment of activity 8.1 were not met in fiscal year 2022. We expect that the transition from Taxonomy-eligible to Taxonomy-aligned will progress over the next few years
corresponding to the fulfillment of the technical screening criteria. For instance, according to the EU Taxonomy regulation, refrigerants used in data centers need to conform with a certain level of
global warming potential. The refrigerants employed by SAP do not meet this threshold yet. An immediate exchange would lead to additional toxic waste and costs. Therefore, SAP intends to
replace the refrigerants according to our regular maintenance schedule over the course of the next few years. Also, SAP’s data center co-locations and hyperscalers are not yet in full alignment
with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy regulation. Together with our providers, we are evaluating options to reach Taxonomy alignment over the next few years.
Furthermore, SAP assessed whether any capital and operational expenditures had been incurred related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned economic
activities. In 2022, SAP capitalized an amount of €151 million relating to the purchase of vehicles. While a portion of these expenses, specifically relating to the purchase of electric vehicles, may
be Taxonomy-aligned, we could not obtain the necessary verification from our suppliers. Therefore, SAP classified the full amount as Taxonomy-eligible (purchases of output of the activity “3.3
Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport" contributing to climate change mitigation) but not as Taxonomy-aligned.
In single locations, SAP operates combined heat/cool and power generation facilities using fossil gaseous fuels. However, the associated potential Taxonomy-eligible and aligned revenues, capital
expenditures, and operational expenditures are negligible. No further activities for nuclear or gas are applicable.
SAP also evaluated whether activity “7.2 Renovation of existing buildings” is relevant for SAP. While SAP regularly conducts renovation measures, for 2022 renovation expenses were considered
immaterial compared to SAP’s total investments and were not clearly distinguishable from other related but non-eligible costs. We therefore concluded that activity 7.2 is not relevant for 2022.

Business Conduct
Vision and Strategy
In an increasingly complex business environment, making the right decisions and abiding by ethical
choices has never been more important. As a company operating in numerous countries across the
globe, SAP is required to adhere to strict international legislation that defines acceptable business
conduct and practices.
At SAP, we also expect our business practices to not only meet international rules and legal
requirements, but to adhere to our internal high standards of ethics and integrity. We understand that
our customers expect this as well. SAP’s reputation for doing business the right way is one of our most
important assets. By striving to make ethical choices and acting with integrity, we aim to continue to
grow SAP in a way that meets both our own and our customers’ high ethical expectations.
Due Diligence
Governance

To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Outside SAP, the OEC regularly exchanges ideas and best practices for compliance processes with
relevant peers in the software industry and beyond. In Germany, the OEC participates in the annual
DAX Chief Compliance Officer Round Table. SAP is also a Corporate Member of the Association of
Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), and the GCCO is also a member of the European Chief
Compliance Officers Forum (ECCIOF) and the UN Global Compact’s Think Lab focused on
transformational governance.
Guidelines and Policies
In 2022, a revised and updated version of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (CoEBC)55 was
rolled out throughout the Company and made available outside of SAP. It replaced multiple existing
local Codes of Business Conduct and provides, in a single document, the primary ethical and legal
framework within which SAP conducts business and remains on course for success. The revised
CoEBC is available in 22 languages.
SAP also expects all partners and suppliers to commit to meeting our high standards of integrity and
sustainability. For this reason, we have the SAP Partner Code of Conduct and the SAP Supplier Code
of Conduct in place so that partners and suppliers understand what is expected of them.
How We Measure and Manage Our Performance
Enforcing Policies and Guidelines
All employees are bound by the CoEBC; they are required to acknowledge its contents and confirm
their commitment to it on an annual basis. In 2022, we continued to monitor employee certification of
the CoEBC for employees worldwide, recording a 99.9% certification rate for permanent SAP
employees (excluding those from acquired companies).
Communication
The OEC’s dedicated communications team consistently distributes integrity-related communications,
at all levels of the Company – including to senior leaders, managers, and employees, as well as topic-
related content for SAP partners. Executive Board members and senior leaders regularly host all-
hands meetings as well as leadership team meetings and smaller gatherings, which include integrity-
focused topics, demonstrating their dedication to ethical business.
Quarterly OEC newsletters provide all SAP employees with information on a range of compliance-
related topics. Additionally, a quarterly newsletter with a focus on leadership and management topics
is sent specifically to executive and senior management.
Employees can use the SAP One employee portal at any time to access all global policies, guidelines,
and additional information. The SAP Compliance mobile app56 also provides convenient, ongoing
access to compliance-related information. Externally, our Web site sap.com features information and
guidance for our external stakeholders.
All Board areas have re-committed their support for OEC’s Compliance Ambassador Program and
have nominated employees to participate in it. In 2022, a fifth cohort was introduced, bringing the
number of participants from over 500 in 2021 to over 1,100 in 2022. The program is designed to give
employees a further point of contact in the business when compliance matters arise. Ambassadors
participate in an extensive curriculum of monthly on-boarding sessions over an 18-month period. They
are expected to cascade and transfer information on the importance of compliance and ethics
throughout their teams and lines of business.
55 Link leads to information that was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance engagement performed by
our external auditor.

Speak Out at SAP is SAP’s independently managed whistleblower reporting tool, through which any
matters or concerns can be reported easily, and, if desired, anonymously. The tool is available
24 hours a day, seven days a week, both internally to SAP employees and externally to concerned
parties, including customers, suppliers, and partners.
Reports may be submitted either directly by the reporter through the Internet-based portal, or by
phone, with local language support across the globe in order to maximize accessibility for reporters. In
all cases, SAP continues to maintain a strict non-retaliation policy.
Compared with the previous whistleblower reporting tool, we observed a substantial increase in the
number of concerns reported through Speak Out at SAP since the tool’s launch in 2021. Within this
increase, a number of the concerns raised came from external parties, such as partners, customers,
and suppliers.
Beyond Speak Out at SAP, we provide further reporting channels, including an internal ticketing
system, a postal address for written submissions, as well as local contact persons worldwide.
Investigating Misconduct
The OEC’s investigations team is comprised of dedicated investigators who probe allegations of
misconduct within the OEC’s area of responsibility. Where appropriate, the OEC engages the
assistance of an external law firm when examining conduct that may violate SAP’s policies and
57 Excludes employees on parental leave, long-term sick leave, sabbaticals, and on early retirement. Training last assigned in 2021 with
biennial frequency.

disciplinary action.
For more information about the material allegations currently being investigated by the OEC, see the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.3).
Related Risks for SAP
The actions and processes to address risks in business conduct are described above. No material

Risk Management and Risks
Our Risk Management
Internal Control and Risk Management Systems
As a global company, SAP is exposed to a broad range of risks across our business operations.
Consequently, our Executive Board has established comprehensive internal control and risk
management structures that enable us to identify and analyze risks early and take appropriate action.
Our internal control and risk management systems are designed to identify potential events that could
negatively impact the Company and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the operating
effectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting.
These systems comprise numerous control mechanisms and are an essential element of our
corporate decision-making process; they are therefore implemented across the entire Group as an
integral part of SAP’s business processes. We have adopted an integrated internal control and risk
management approach to help maintain appropriate and effective global risk management while also
enabling us to aggregate risks and report on them transparently.
Appropriateness and Effectiveness of SAP’s Entire Internal Control and Risk
Management System62
We have a governance model in place across the internal control and risk management systems, as
well as a central software solution to store, maintain, and report all risk-relevant information. In the
Business Conduct section of our combined management report, we describe in more detail the
governance structure as well as the measures and guidelines SAP has implemented to ensure
compliance not only with international rules and legal requirements but also with our internal
standards of ethics and integrity. Furthermore, SAP monitors risks relating to material sustainability
matters. Material non-financial topics are listed in the section Non-Financial Statement Including
Information on Sustainable Activities. The governance model, policies, and guidelines as well as the
control measures we have implemented relative to these topics are described in the respective
chapters in this combined management report. SAP constantly reviews and adjusts its entire internal
control and risk management system as well as the policies and guidelines we have implemented
regarding the material sustainability topics. We considered the results from external audits, such as
the audit of our internal control system for financial reporting and early risk detection system
conducted by our auditor KPMG, as well as internal sources, such as audit reports from our Global
Risk & Assurance Services (GR&AS) team, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control and risk
management systems. If issues are identified, SAP takes remedial action. While the non-financial
internal control system has not yet reached the same maturity level as the financial internal control
system, no material indication has come to our attention that SAP’s entire internal control and risk
management system is not appropriate or effective.
Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Due to our public listings in both Germany and the United States, we are subject to both German and
U.S. regulatory requirements that relate to internal controls and risk management over financial
reporting, such as provisions in the German Stock Corporation Act, section 91 (2), the U.S. Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, specifically sections 302 and 404, and the German Corporate Governance
Code. Hence, our Executive Board has established an early warning system (risk management
system) to enable compliance with applicable regulations.
62 The appropriateness and effectiveness of SAP’s entire internal control and risk management system, except for the internal control
system for financial reporting and early risk detection system, was neither part of the statutory audit nor the independent limited assurance
engagement performed by our external auditor.

Risk Management Policy and Framework
The risk management policy issued by our Executive Board governs how we manage risk in line with
the Company’s risk appetite and defines a methodology that is applied uniformly across all parts of
the Group.

Our Global Risk Management Governance Framework
The risk management governance framework at SAP represents a comprehensive system of
approaches and processes to ensure control through a clearly structured risk management system
and a supporting risk culture. The risk culture is considered the basis of SAP’s risk management
system. Risk culture at SAP comprises a system of values, beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and
understanding concerning risks and risk management as part of our corporate culture. To support and
continuously foster SAP’s risk culture, we conduct risk activities for the entire SAP organization such
as mandatory training in ethical behavior, code of conduct, and risk management.
Our Executive Board is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the internal control system and
our risk management system. The effectiveness of both systems and their implementation in the
different Board areas is monitored by each Executive Board member. The Audit and Compliance
Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly monitors the effectiveness of SAP’s internal control and
risk management systems. Our GR&AS organization regularly provides a status update on the internal
control and the risk management systems to the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Supervisory
Board. Every year, SAP’s external auditors assess whether the SAP Group early-warning system for
risk detection is adequate to identify risks that might endanger our ability to continue as a going
concern. Additional assurance is obtained through the external audit of the effectiveness of our
system of internal controls over financial reporting.
Our Corporate Financial Reporting (CFR) department codifies all accounting and reporting policies in
our Group accounting and global revenue recognition guidelines. These policies and the corporate
131/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
closing schedule, together with our process descriptions, define the closing process. Under this
closing process, we prepare, predominately through centralized or external services, the financial
statements of all SAP entities for consolidation by CFR. CFR and other corporate departments are
responsible for ensuring compliance with Group accounting policies and monitor the accounting work.
CFR reviews accounting standards and processes to ensure applicable updates are made to SAP’s
financial reporting.

Moreover, protecting and defending our intellectual property is crucial to our success. The outcome of
litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:
dependency in the aggregate on third-party technology, including cloud and Web services, that we
embed in our products or that we resell to our customers; integration of open source software
components from third parties into our software and the implications derived from it; inability to
prevent third parties from obtaining, using, or selling without authorization what we regard as our
proprietary technology and information; and the possibility that third parties might reverse-engineer or
otherwise obtain and use technology and information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, the
laws and courts of certain countries might not offer effective means to enforce our legal or intellectual
property rights. Finally, SAP may not be able to collect all judgments awarded to it in legal
proceedings. The outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.
Management’s view of the litigation might also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and
other claims or lawsuits could differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods,
which are the basis for our accounting for these litigations and claims under IFRS.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: have various internal programs, such as internal policies, processes, and
monitoring in place to assess and manage the risks associated with open source and third-party
intellectual property; endeavor to protect ourselves in the respective third-party software agreements
by obtaining certain rights in case such agreements are terminated; and are a party to certain patent
cross-license agreements with third parties.

Non-compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws by SAP or any of the subprocessors
engaged by SAP within the processing of personal data could lead to risks. These include, among
others: mandatory disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, customers, and data protection
supervisory authorities; investigations and administrative measures by data protection supervisory
authorities, such as the instruction to alter or stop non-compliant data processing activities, including
the instruction to stop using non-compliant subprocessors; or the possibility of damage claims by
customers and individuals, contract terminations, and potential fines.
In addition, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and security industry
experts continue to warn of risks related to a globally growing number of cybersecurity attacks aimed
at obtaining or violating company data including personal data.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial
performance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: have implemented internal processes and measures to enable SAP to
comply successfully and sufficiently with applicable data protection requirements; anchor data
protection requirements in the mandatory product standards of SAP’s product development lifecycle;
continuously review SAP’s existing standards and policies to address changes to applicable laws and
regulations; continuously enhance our data center operations worldwide; actively monitor legal
developments; engage with political stakeholders and government authorities; and provide clear
governance and guidance on data handling, processing standards, and external communication as
part of our data management framework, specifically incorporating aspects of new technologies such
as those represented in embedded intelligence applications.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Corporate Governance and Compliance Risks
Ethical Behavior: Our global business exposes us to risks related to unethical behavior and
non-compliance with policies by employees, other individuals, partners, third parties, or
entities associated with SAP.
SAP’s leadership position in the global market is founded on the long-term and sustainable trust of
our stakeholders worldwide. Our overarching approach is one of corporate transparency, open
communication with financial markets, regulators, and authorities, and adherence to recognized
standards of business integrity. This commitment to recognized standards of business integrity is
formalized in SAP’s CoEBC and supporting guidelines.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: non-
compliance with our policies and violation of compliance related rules, regulations, and legal
requirements including, but not limited to, anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation in Germany, the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt
conduct; unethical and fraudulent behavior leading to criminal charges, fines, and claims by affected
parties; collusion with external third parties; fraud and corruption; public sector transactions in
territories exposed to a high risk of corruption; or increased exposure and impact on business
activities in highly regulated industries.
137/335 SAP Integrated Report 2022
To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Additional
Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand,
competitive or financial position, share price, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has encountered situations that required clear messaging and strong action on non-compliance
in the context of corrupt behavior that has the potential to harm our business and reputation. SAP is
continuing to investigate its dealings with the public sector.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: continuously evolve our comprehensive compliance program based on the
three pillars of prevention, detection, and response; improve associated business processes, to
prevent further and future violations; review partner business models, to mitigate risks of corruption
while meeting agility requirements; conduct internal audits of our compliance programs related to
bribery, corruption, and substantial fraud; annually reconfirm commitment to the CoEBC by SAP’s
workforce (except where disallowed by local legal regulations); implement compliance policies and
processes aimed at managing third parties and preventing misuse of third-party payments for illegal
purposes, including the performance of compliance due diligence activities prior to the engagement of
third parties; and launched a Partner Integrity Initiative aimed at examining the compliance programs
of partners in SAP’s ecosystem and reviewing the SAP-related deals closed by them. We also
introduced a platform called "Speak Out at SAP" for anyone within and outside of SAP to raise
confidentially and, if desired, anonymously their concerns on ethics and compliance related to our
CoEBC and any law or regulation.
Despite our comprehensive and continuously evolving compliance programs and internal controls,
intentional efforts of individuals to circumvent controls or engage in corruption, especially by way of
collusion with other involved parties, cannot always be prevented.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and
classify this risk fact.
