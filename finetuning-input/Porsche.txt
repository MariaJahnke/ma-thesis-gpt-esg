dialogue partners. Trusting exchange with our stakeholders must be geared towards the long term and be nurtured on an ongoing basis. The Porsche AG Group believes it is important for people to talk to one another, not about one another. The company aims to understand different positions by adopting different perspectives, jointly overcome challenges, and foster long-term partnerships. The Porsche AG Group does this by using different media and dialogue formats, as well as various internal and external communication channels.
The Porsche AG Group establishes and maintains personal contact in order to maintain a continuous dialogue with its stakeholders. For instance, this entails events like the Neigh- borhood Dialogues at the company’s sites. Since 2016, these have given, among others, local residents the opportunity to regularly engage with experts from the Porsche AG Group and raise specific issues.
The Covid-19 pandemic and the legal requirements meant that the dialogue formats planned for the reporting year could not take place as normal. Instead, the Porsche AG Group increas- ingly drew on virtual exchange with the key figures and groups in order to obtain direct feedback and input. If necessary, stake- holders can contact the department responsible for sustainabil- ity directly using the email address ↗ sustainability@porsche.com.
Memberships and networks 
The Porsche AG Group promotes economic, environmental, and social topics through its involvement in networks, sustain- ability initiatives, and working groups. This too is part of the Porsche AG Group’s stakeholder dialogue.
UN Global Compact
Porsche AG has been a member of the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest and most important sustainable and responsible corporate governance initiative, since 2022. The platform for developing, implementing, and disclosing responsible business practices calls on companies to align their activities and strategies with the ten generally recog- nized principles in the fields of human rights, labor, environ- ment, and corruption prevention. They are also called on to take action to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Porsche AG will report to the UN Global Compact on its activities in these fields on a regular basis.
The UN Global Compact was founded in 2000. It is one of the largest sustainability initiatives in the world, with more than 19,000 companies and organizations in more than 160 countries.
In the year under review, Porsche AG joined the UN Global Com- pact, the world’s largest and most important sustainable and responsible corporate governance initiative.
Dialogue with politics
When the Porsche AG Group makes business decisions, the consequences of its actions for society and the environment have to be assessed and incorporated into the internal pro- cesses. The Porsche AG Group operates in a complex and heavily regulated field. It is important to engage in transparent and proactive dialogue with representatives from governments, par- liaments, authorities, associations, institutions, and representa- tives of civil society through political lobbying.
The employees of the Politics and Society department who are responsible for political lobbying work in and with associations at times. They are in regular contact with numerous nongovern- mental organizations (NGO) as well as civil society, political, and business representatives. In doing so, they set out the positions of the Porsche AG Group in social and political discourse, as well as decision-making processes. This takes place in compliance with binding Group-wide guidelines, as well as in coordination with the Volkswagen Group. Its policy is based on the principles of integrity, compliance, transparency, and traceability. Competition and antitrust legislation, as well as other legal provisions, are always taken into account too. Porsche AG
is registered in the Lobby Register (↗ https://www.lobbyregister. bundestag.de) for the purposes of lobbying the German Bundestag and the German government.
In the coming financial year, the Porsche AG Group will continue to contribute to the working groups in the existing networks. Likewise, the Porsche AG Group is striving to join other sustainability networks and engage with them.


TRANSPARENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Porsche AG Group is aware of the importance of its rep- utation to the success of its business. The Porsche AG Group regularly takes its stakeholders’ interests into account when it makes relevant decisions. In particular, its stakeholders include customers, employees, investors, business partners, and non-governmental organizations. The Porsche AG Group sets great store by living up to the expectations of these stakehold- ers and society as a whole.
As the general public demands greater transparency, credible communication on ethical and responsible behavior is increas- ingly important. The significance of intensive communication with stakeholders is also rising: in a dynamic and increasingly complex environment, interactions between the Porsche AG Group and its stakeholders must be open and constructive. The Porsche AG Group wants to critically analyze social and ecological challenges, take the diversity of different viewpoints into account strategically, and discuss perspectives and prior- ities with stakeholders. A Group-wide policy has to ensure that internal and external communications are active, professional, transparent, consistent, and credible. Its purpose is to make sure that the Porsche AG Group represents its positions with one voice and consistent arguments.
Transparency and communication
A company cannot be credible or enjoy robust relationships with its stakeholders without clear communication and transparency. Substantial communication content is also crucial to success. Therefore, the Porsche AG Group prioritizes informing the general public and selected target groups about certain issues in an open, specific manner, such as: why is sustainability crucial to the Porsche AG Group? What ambitious targets have been agreed? Have these targets been achieved using the reported methods? Transparency and dialogue about these topics are integral aspects at the Porsche AG Group.
ESG management at the Porsche AG Group
The Porsche AG Group completed its IPO in the reporting year, which means that the expectations of the capital market have become more relevant. It is important to the Porsche AG Group to be seen as sustainable and valuable by analysts and other professional stakeholders. In particular, it aims to meet the sustainability expectations of investors and other market players who focus on environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) aspects. ESG describes a series of sustainability-related requirements that the Porsche AG Group has to meet, and helps it categorize and evaluate its sustainability efforts more effec- tively. The Porsche AG Group wants to accomplish outstanding results here to impress its stakeholders.
To this end, it initiated a project to launch a software-based ESG management system in 2021, which continued in the reporting year. Adopting an integrated approach, it complements the strategy with additional key topics.
The ESG management system should make it easier for the Executive Board and the relevant departments to monitor and manage their ESG contributions, interpret results, and produce regular reports. In the year under review, work started on the construction of a centralized IT system for this purpose. The outcome of this system is pooled centrally within the Sustain- ability department.
Furthermore, the Porsche AG Group has determined perfor- mance indicators, which illustrate material non-financial ESG contributions and transparently demonstrate the Porsche business model’s contribution to sustainable development. The Porsche AG Group aims to control and measure its ESG contri- butions strategically on the basis of these key indicators.
ESG ratings
The Porsche AG Group has itself rated by external organizations to this end and bases its improvement measures on the results of these ratings. Selected independent rating agencies analyze the sustainability efforts of the Porsche AG Group.
In its sustainability strategy, the Porsche AG Group aims to
be rated “in best class” in independent sustainability ratings, which would make it one of the leading companies in the automotive industry. The Porsche AG Group considers this independent, external assessment to be an important tool and source of impetus: building on this, it can continuously improve its sustainability management. The Porsche AG Group has already received ESG ratings from third parties in the past: the Porsche AG Group considers the ESG rating of B- it received from ISS in October 2021 to be one of its most important achievements. The Porsche AG Group received one of the high- est scores in the automotive industry. ↗ https://www.issgovernance. com/esg/ratings
COMPLIANCE AND INTEGRITY
Compliance at Porsche
The following disclosures about compliance at Porsche AG complement the disclosures in the non-financial statement. Compliance and integrity are addressed in the → section entitled  “Responsible corporate governance, compliance, and integrity”.
At Porsche AG, the Code of Conduct sets out the most impor- tant principles and expectations of compliance in three different aspects: as a member of society, as a business partner, and in the workplace. Another code, the Code of Conduct for Business Partners, states that Porsche AG expects its business partners to adhere to the relevant laws, recognize basic ethical values, and act in a sustainable manner. Both of these codes explicitly bring the whistleblower system at Porsche AG to people’s atten- tion. Furthermore, the Executive Board has adopted the Compli- ance Management guidelines: these represent an undertaking by Porsche AG to ensure compliance with laws and guidelines.
Compliance organization and
compliance measures
The compliance management system (CMS) at Porsche AG
is a preventative framework for the totality of all principles, measures, and objective processes that serve to safeguard and implement compliance in six areas of compliance. It is intended to ensure that violations of the law and/or directives in these areas of compliance are prevented, or at least rendered signifi- cantly more difficult.
Employees can report potential breaches of the rules using an internal whistleblowing mechanism that has been set up and communicated. Outside the company, employees and external individuals can report breaches to two ombudsmen who are subject to professional duties of secrecy under German law. These internal and external points of contact for the whis- tleblower system can be contacted in a variety of ways at any time, even anonymously, free of charge. Porsche AG acts on incoming reports, taking into account data protection, labor law, and co-determination regulations. Whistleblowers need
not fear any disciplinary measures or other repercussions from Porsche AG. Porsche AG reacts to identified violations in compli- ance with the data protection, labor law, and co-determination regulations. Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, suitable countermeasures are introduced on a case-by-case basis, and individual misconduct is punished on a case-by-case basis depending on the outcome of the investigation.
Overall, Porsche’s whistleblower system was responsible
for following up on 63 of 168 submitted reports. The plausi- bility check rated 34 of these 63 reports as plausible. Of the 34 plausible reports, 13 were categorized as potentially severe breaches of the rules, and investigated through Porsche’s
whistleblower system. The focal points of the potential misconduct were violations of the German Trade Secrets Act (GeschGehG) and offenses against property (such as fraud and embezzlement).
Eight cases concluded in the identification of a serious breach of the rules and resulted in sanctions. Four investigations ended without identifying a breach of the rules. One case was still open at the end of the reporting year.
The central Compliance department has been conducting compliance monitoring since 2021. Besides interviews with managers, it involves risk-oriented activities such as random inspections of transactions that are of relevance in terms
of compliance. The results are compiled in a report that also describes appropriate action if there is an evident need for improvement.
Compliance communication at Porsche AG focused on intranet posts in the reporting year, addressing topics such as the updated Code of Conduct leaflet and International Anti- Corruption Day. The compliance officers also released various internal communications in the form of info sessions, posts
in departmental groups, and messages to managers.
Compliance training
In cooperation with the HR department, the compliance offi- cers provide compliance training at Porsche AG and selected subsidiaries. The basis is a subject-specific plan which uses risk analyses to identify the relevant target groups and key areas of content. There are mandatory training formats for managers, junior managers, and new employees. The compliance officers also provide organized training for specific departments and target groups, such as on legally mandatory or current topics, or on request.
In the reporting year, 5,817 employees at Porsche AG and its relevant German subsidiaries received compliance training at in-person and virtual events, and 57,337 participants received compliance training through digital training modules. The digital Code of Conduct training module was completed by 17,296 employees from Porsche AG and 7,458 employees from its relevant German subsidiaries. This training module covers the directive of the same name and provides information about the whistleblower system and the contact details of the com- pliance help desk. The training also covers the content of the “Avoidance of conflicts of interest and corruption” and “Human rights” guidelines. By the end of the reporting year, the rate of training in face-to-face and virtual events within the target group at Porsche AG and its relevant German subsidiaries was 93% on average for the defined areas of compliance. In 2022, Porsche AG piloted a digital training module on fraud prevention within Procurement.

Sustainability Governance 115

Porsche Mentoring is a format for a comprehensive exchange of experiences and changing views on both sides. In this program, managers support the professional and personal development of young talent.
The diversity networks and the mentoring program are open to all employees of Porsche AG and selected subsidiaries around the world.
Porsche AG also campaigns for a diverse and inclusive togeth- erness outside of its work sites. The “Porsche helps” platform facilitates employees who want to get involved in voluntary activities, for example, one-off engagements, team events or major events at social organizations. The aim is to do good together and to gain new perspectives, experiences and skills. In the reporting year, team events were introduced, and some major events were expanded.
RESULTS
Porsche AG came sixth in the Women Career Index in 2022.
The Porsche women’s network recorded significant growth numbers in the reporting year. The Proud@Porsche com- munity also became an official employee network in the reporting period.
More than 240 mentor tandems were actively involved in the mentoring format in the reporting year.
The Trendence Institute presented “Porsche helps” with the Trendence Award in the category “Companies helping people”.
Despite a slight decrease in the gender quota at the first man- agement level in the reporting year, Porsche AG still considers itself on track to meet the target by 2025.

Stakeholder dialogue
TARGETS
The aim of the Porsche AG Group’s overarching stakeholder management system is to systematically capture the interests of various stakeholders as well as to derive key social trends and key topics from their interests and points of view. A major aspect is the active contribution to sustainability networks. The Porsche AG Group intends to join additional alliances to those it already has in order to get into contact with groups of stake- holders there. In the Porsche AG Group, the Politics and Society department coordinates the stakeholder management.
Stakeholder management at the Porsche AG Group includes continuously identifying relevant groups of stakeholders, ana- lyzing their interests and opinions and enabling direct dialogue. As a result of this, the Porsche AG Group is expanding its views and recognizing trends. It also receives impetus for improve- ments and innovations, exchanges expertise and finds coop- eration partners. In these dialogues, however, the Porsche AG Group also identifies potential problems, resistance and conflicts of interest at an early stage, creates a level of under- standing and takes countermeasures. The Porsche Sustainabil- ity Council plays a key role here. More information can be found in the → “Sustainability management” section.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS
The complaint management system is the central port of call for suggestions for improvement and complaints from internal and external groups of stakeholders at the Stuttgart-Zuffen- hausen site. It is centralized in Politics and Society as well as Environment and Construction Management. The Politics and Society department also provides the markets with international consulting services on the systematic recording of complaints relating to social or political matters. This also applies to the identification of measures.
The Porsche AG Group uses extensive surveys to learn about its stakeholders’ opinions on sustainability and to include them in its strategy as part of the materiality assessment. To date, the Porsche AG Group has performed these stakeholder surveys every two years, most recently in 2021. More detailed conver- sations with selected stakeholders take place as needed.
MEASURES
The Porsche AG Group was also engaged in proactive dialogue with its stakeholders and continuously expanded this dialogue in 2022.
The most important sources of information about the
Porsche AG Group for thought leaders, decision makers and cus- tomers include the Porsche magazine Christophorus, the online Newsroom with its Twitter and Instagram channels, the web- based TV channel 9:11 Magazine, the 9:11 Porsche podcasts and the Porsche website.
All internal communications at Porsche AG are published in dig- ital and printed formats through the Carrera media. The Carrera Online web pages and the Carrera Magazine provide employees with information on the latest developments in the area of sus- tainability. Regular works and departmental meetings, employee information events, themed weeks and digital events also form part of the extensive array of internal communications. This is one way for employees to contribute their own thoughts and ideas and interact directly with their line managers.
Events such as the neighborhood dialogues held at various pro- duction and development sites enable Porsche AG to establish personal contact with local stakeholders. Since 2016, these have given local residents the opportunity to regularly engage with Porsche AG experts and raise specific issues and questions. The pandemic meant that no events with residents could take place on site in the reporting year. However, the email address ↗ nachgefragt@porsche.de can be used for active dialogue with
the neighborhood. If necessary, stakeholders can contact the departments responsible for sustainability directly using the email address ↗ sustainability@porsche.com.
The Porsche AG Group is an active participant in the industry dialogue on the German National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights (NAP). Porsche AG has also been a member of the German Environmental Management Association (B.A.U.M.) since 2016. In 2017, Porsche AG also joined the European Business Ethics Network Deutschland (DNWE) and became a signatory to the state of Baden-Württemberg’s WIN Charter for sustainable business, marking its commitment to entrepre- neurial responsibility. In 2019, Porsche AG and the Volkswagen Group were the first automobile manufacturers to become a core component of the Value Balancing Alliance.
In the reporting year, Porsche AG joined the world’s largest and most important initiative for sustainable and responsible corpo- rate governance, the UN Global Compact.
The Politics and Society department coordinates all the political topics that are relevant to the Porsche AG Group. It is also responsible for the Porsche AG Group’s political lobbying and holds a transparent and proactive sociopolitical dialogue with representatives from governments, parliaments, authorities, associations, institutions and civil society. The Politics and Soci- ety department organizes and also supports visits by politicians and political events as well as providing regular updates on political topics and developments to the Executive Board.
All of the Porsche AG Group’s political activities are coordinated via the Governmental Affairs Steering Committee to ensure a joined-up approach and consistent communications in dialogue with stakeholders.
Group-wide guidelines stipulate the principles of integrity, transparency and traceability for every political activity. It also contains guidelines for contact with political stakeholders and regulates the political lobbying process. All the people respon- sible for politics at the Porsche AG Group regularly notify the Volkswagen Group’s Public Affairs department of their activities.
RESULTS
The dialogue formats planned for the reporting year could not take place as normal because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the Porsche AG Group increasingly drew on virtual exchange with the key stakeholders in order to obtain direct feedback and input.
In 2022, there was no expenditure related to supporting political party events, advertising in publications affiliated with parties, or external lobbying agencies or services.
GOVERNANCE
The Porsche AG Group’s business practices are based on integrity, transparency and responsibility. Innovations cre-
ate new customer experiences, optimize added value and
help reach sustainability targets. The Porsche AG Group sees digitalization as an opportunity for further development and
is taking on responsibility as a partner in society with the Corporate Digital Responsibility strategy. Customer and vehicle safety is of utmost importance to the Porsche AG Group.
The company simultaneously has a clear focus on long-term customer satisfaction.


The Code of Conduct at Porsche AG summarizes the most important principles and expectations about acting lawfully, sustainably and with integrity at Porsche AG. For example, deal- ing with conflicts of interest, combating any form of corruption, appropriate behavior within the group and towards customers, business partners and public officials as well as taking responsi- bility for the environment and society.
The guidelines define and regulate the compliance requirements in three aspects:
1. As a member of society: human rights; equal opportunities and equal treatment; product conformity and product safety; environmental protection; donations, sponsorships and char- ity; communication and marketing; political lobbying
2. As a business partner: conflicts of interest; gifts, hospital- ity and invitations; prohibition of corruption; dealings with officials and holders of political office; prohibition of money laundering and terrorism financing; accounting and financial reporting; taxes and customs; fair and free competition; procurement; export control; prohibition of insider trading
3. At the workplace: occupational safety and healthcare; data protection; security and protection of information, know- how and intellectual property; IT security; handling company assets
The additional Code of Conduct for Business Partners governs Porsche AG’s expectation that its business partners will comply with the law as applicable, acknowledge the principles of ethical conduct and acting sustainably.
The Executive Board also adopted the company compli- ance management guideline. Porsche AG thus complies with its entrepreneurial responsibility and meets the statutory obligation to adhere to statutory requirements as well as internal guidelines.
Porsche AG’s compliance management system (CMS) forms the preventive framework for all principles, measures and processes not related to a specific person, which serve to ensure and implement compliance in six compliance topics. This aims to prevent breaches of the law and/or policy violations in these topics or to at least make them significantly more difficult.
Due diligence process
Porsche AG uses a compliance monitoring system to check adherence with specific compliance requirements relating to anti-corruption, anti-trust law and prevention of money launder- ing in the specialist departments. In addition to the areas listed, monitoring primarily focused on the implementation of risk-mit- igating measures in the reporting year. The identified potential for improvement has been included in the relevant departments’ action plans. The monitoring also provided extensive findings for the CMS, which will be taken into account in Porsche AG’s compliance program for 2023.
Porsche AG also carries out compliance risk analyses in the compliance topics mentioned above. In the reporting year, Porsche AG continued these for other key departments.
Measures
Porsche AG introduced the compliance management system in 2012. It covers all principles, measures and processes not related to a specific person, with which Porsche AG wants to ensure compliance and achieve the compliance goals men- tioned earlier.
A compliance organization made up of the Chief Compliance Officer and those responsible for specific compliance topics is responsible for developing suitable targets and measures. The Chief Compliance Officer provides the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee with an annual report on the progress of implementing the CMS as well as on the significant measures and activities. According to the company compliance management guideline, the Executive Board of Porsche AG decides on the local set-up and further develop- ment of the CMS, based on a recommendation from the Chief Compliance Officer.
In 2022, compliance risk analyses were carried out in the compliance topics of active and passive corruption (including fraud, embezzlement and conflicts of interest), anti-trust law and prevention of money laundering at Porsche AG. These were also performed for six of Porsche AG’s other main departments in the reporting year, whereby risk analyses were available
for 59 of 64 relevant main departments of Porsche AG by the end of 2022.
The preventive measures that have already been established mainly include the compliance requirements (e.g., guidelines for Porsche AG itself). There are also information and training ses- sions available for employees on relevant compliance topics as well as confidential compliance advice: Employees can ask any compliance-related questions at a centralized compliance help- desk. Furthermore, they have the possibility to report potential violations to an internal whistleblower system via fixed internal reporting channels. This whistleblower system is regulated in the group guideline of the same name. The two guidelines also explicitly bring the whistleblower system to people’s attention. Porsche AG also publishes detailed information about this sys- tem on its intranet and the internet. Externally, two ombudsmen are available to employees, customers and business partners of Porsche AG as well as public officials or other external parties. They can be reached free of charge and at any time via various reporting channels and they also accept anonymous reports about potential violations.
In the reporting year 2022, those responsible for compliance topics carried out numerous communication measures at Porsche AG. There were also in-person and virtual appointments for employee training as well as digital learning modules at Porsche AG and the relevant German subsidiaries.
Results
Within the compliance organization’s work, the focus in 2022 again was on the specialist support of and participation in com- pliance projects of the Volkswagen Group as well as in initiatives and projects of Porsche AG.
Once again, the majority of the employee requests to the com- pliance helpdesk related to dealing with invitations and gifts. The number of reports of potential violations was up on the prior-year level.
In accordance with the group guideline on the prevention of money laundering, Porsche AG submitted three suspicious activity reports to the responsible anti-money laundering authorities in the reporting year.
INTEGRITY
Targets
Correct conduct only when there are laws, regulations and requirements in place is not sufficient for long-term success. If there are no explicit rules or if conflicting objectives arise, one needs integrity as an inner compass on how to act in the right way. The topic is also gaining in importance because increas- ingly shorter innovation cycles, a changing automotive industry and a dynamic environment require entrepreneurial speed more and more frequently.
Integrity management at Porsche AG has set itself the target of anchoring integrity in the corporate culture for the long term. Managers and employees should be able to act in accordance with ethical principles, with responsibility, from conviction and steadfastly. Porsche AG wants to strengthen the confidence of its employees, customers, shareholders and partners. In order to promote this value- and attitude-based culture in the best possible way, integrity management at Porsche AG is enshrined within the Human Resources portfolio in the Executive Board in Employee Development and Corporate Culture.
Integrity is a core value in the Porsche Code — the company’s leadership model — and provides a solid basis for the organi- zation. The Porsche AG Code of Conduct not only emphasizes the importance of honest and ethical conduct and acting
with integrity on the part of each individual, but also explicitly highlights the role model function of members of the Executive Board and managers.
Due diligence process
Integrity is firmly entrenched in the personnel processes on onboarding, recruiting, personnel development, remuneration and disciplinary actions. Minimum standards are determined in the group guideline on HR compliance.
The topic of culture and integrity was rolled out internationally at the Porsche AG Group by the Volkswagen Group as part of its Together4Integrity (T4I) program in 2018. These long-term measures aim to further strengthen the culture of integrity.
The package of measures and the implementation time may vary depending on the local circumstances. A central reporting system informs on the status of implementation of the projects in the relevant group companies. The status of implementation is also a regular reporting topic in the T4I meetings.
In addition, Porsche AG also uses results from the employee survey to derive measures for managing integrity. A poll about acting with integrity and compliant conduct is part of the annual mood barometer. Among other things, this gives insights into the development of the integrity culture. The results of the mood barometer are then discussed in the organizational units. This mandatory discussion slots into the team dialogues on culture and values in the company — a format in which manag- ers and employees work on measures to improve collaboration together. Training formats on the topic of integrity or with content on integrity are also available.

     REPORTING POLICY
Reporting structure
The two primary objectives of Porsche AG’s activities are to accomplish economic success and take on responsibility — for sustainable activity, for secure jobs, and for society. Active practice, trust, and commitment are what set Porsche apart. It is therefore important to Porsche AG to make the public aware of business developments and its activities in connection with sustainability.
As such, this report encompasses the financial and sustainabil- ity reporting of the Porsche AG Group.
Changes in reporting
Porsche AG is subject to extended reporting obligations as a result of its IPO. The annual and sustainability report of the Porsche AG Group comprises three parts: the financial report (→ pages 160–371), the non-financial statement as part of the combined management report (→ pages 188–221), and the sus- tainability report (→ page 72–117).
The consolidated financial statements of Porsche AG as of December 31, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), as of the reporting date, as well as the supplementary regulations of Section 315e of Ger- many’s Commercial Code (HGB). The combined management report is based on the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German accounting standards formalizing the requirements of the Commercial Code.
The non-financial statement relates to the subject areas of Sec- tion 289c HGB: environmental, employee, and social concerns, respect for human rights, and the fight against corruption and
bribery. In accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), this text focuses on material topics that are necessary in order to understand the course of business, the business result, the position of the Porsche AG Group, and the impact of the Porsche AG Group on the non-financial aspects.
Furthermore, Porsche AG is complying with the reporting obli- gations arising from Article 8 of the newly introduced Taxonomy Regulation (officially Regulation (EU) 2020/852) for the first time. The section entitled “EU taxonomy” has been integrated into the non-financial statement for the first time as a result.
The Porsche AG has prepared its annual and sustainability report in accordance with the current version of the GRI Sus- tainability Reporting Standards in 2021. The GRI content index can be found on → pages 391–396. The GRI examined this content index in its entirety as part of its “Content Index — Essentials” service.
Furthermore, Porsche follows the recommendations of the
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
on effective climate-related reporting. The information on how climate-related opportunities and risks are handled is published as part of a TCFD index on → page 397.
Additionally, the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) has published the “Automobiles” industry standard, on the basis of which companies are able to publish relevant indus- try-specific sustainability information for investors. The SASB index is presented from → page 400 onwards.
Porsche AG has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2022. Therefore, the company reports on how it implements the 10 principles of the Global Compact into its business practices.




Return on investment
The return on investment represents the return on average invested capital for a particular period on the basis of the operating profit after tax. Invested capital is calculated as the operating assets reported in the balance sheet (property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, inventories, and receiv- ables) less non-interest-bearing liabilities (trade payables and payments on account received). The average invested capital is derived from the balance at the beginning and the end of the reporting period.
Return on sales
The return on sales of the Porsche AG Group is defined as the ratio of operating profit (before the financial result and taxes; EBIT) to sales revenue. The Executive Board of Porsche AG uses the return on sales to assess the operating profitability of the Porsche AG Group.
S
Scalable Systems Platform (SSP)
The Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) is a cutting-edge mecha- tronics platform for all-electric vehicles. It is being developed by the Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen brands, as well as CARIAD for the software architecture. The high-performance version (SSP Sport) in particular is expected to support Porsche BEVs in the longer term.

The Porsche AG Group’s vision of a factory that has the smallest negative impact on the environment possible. The environmen- tal impact is to be reduced by means of selected KPIs and addi- tional qualitative criteria that are implemented in eleven fields of action. This way, the environmental impacts by Porsche’s own production activities are to be reduced by 95% by 2030 com- pared to the 2018 baseline (or by 2040 for the development site in Weissach).
The image displays a table with information on compliance topics related to anti-corruption and anti-competitive behavior, specifically referencing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards from 2016 and 2021. Here’s a detailed description of each section of the table:

### Anti-corruption Section
1. **GRI 3: Material Topics 2021**
   - **3-3 Management of material topics**: This entry, numbered 115, 213, refers to the management approaches for material topics identified in the 2021 GRI standards.
   
2. **GRI 205: Anti-corruption 2016**
   - **205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption**: Number 426 indicates the operational areas assessed for risks related to corruption. The note mentions that information is only partially available.
   - **205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures**: Number 215, suggesting documentation or procedures in place for communication and training about anti-corruption, with no additional information or notes provided.

### Anti-competitive Behavior Section
1. **GRI 3: Material Topics 2021**
   - **3-3 Management of material topics**: Repeats the earlier reference (115, 213) to the management of material topics.
   
2. **GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behavior 2016**
   - **206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices**: Indicates the company’s tracking of legal actions related to anti-competitive behaviors. The information is noted as not published for reasons of confidentiality.

### General Observations
- The table segments compliance into two critical areas: anti-corruption and anti-competitive behavior, reflecting the company's proactive approach to managing potential business risks and ensuring ethical operations.
- The references to GRI standards highlight the organization’s commitment to transparency and adherence to internationally recognized compliance frameworks.
- However, the notation about partial availability or confidentiality of certain data suggests limits to the accessibility of full information regarding the company's compliance efforts or incidents, which is common in corporate reporting for sensitive issues.

This format and the data provided are likely part of an annual report or compliance disclosure document aimed at informing stakeholders about the organization’s ongoing efforts to manage and mitigate compliance-related risks.
